Fiverr for Android is now available. You can grab it from the Google Play store.

If you didn&#8217;t know, Fiverr is a platform for people to buy/sell micro jobs. You can hire people who are willing to do something for $5. Also, you can sell your own services for $5.

Fiverr has been <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/fiverr/id346080608?mt=8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/fiverr/id346080608?mt=8', 'available on the iOS platform']);" >available on the iOS platform</a> since last December. It is the first time it has come to the Android world.

Based on first impressions, the app is beautifully coded. It has a menu section in the left side and there, you&#8217;ll find yourÂ *Inbox, Collections, Sales, Shopping and Notifications. *

The app offers options to quickly purchase your favorite Gigs and also notifies you whenever a buyer contacts you or when there is an update to your sale.

It comes with a search box too, to help you find the Gig that you need among the millions that are available.

Sadly, there isn&#8217;t an option to create your Gigs. For creating Gigs, you&#8217;ll have to visit the Fiverr website on your mobile or desktop browser.
