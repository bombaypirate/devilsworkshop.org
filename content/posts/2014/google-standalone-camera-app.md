Today, Google has introduced a new standalone Camera App. This was significantly needed as many Android phones which are not Nexus did not have useful features like &#8220;Photosphere&#8221;. Overall the camera features even on Nexus were not exactly brilliant.

So a standalone camera app will be very useful for Android users. Even if you are using a Nexus, this there are some added features so it is a good idea to go ahead and update the app or re-install it.

The Google Camera app is only available for Android 4.4+ (KitKat) version for phones and tablets.<figure id="attachment_80319" style="width: 375px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  * The prominent feature are Lens Blur and Panorama. Overall the options are a lot easier flip through.
  * I tested the Lens Blur function and was quite impressed with how well it works. Below is an image I took using Lens Blur.<figure id="attachment_80320" style="width: 443px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Now hopefully we will see better cameras on Android phones than what are available now.Â If you have an Android phone running 4.4 KitKat, then this app would be really useful one.
