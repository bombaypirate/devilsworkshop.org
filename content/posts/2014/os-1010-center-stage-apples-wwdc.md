Last year has been pretty huge for iOS, with major changes in interface, along with addition of lots of new features. Apple did release OS X Mavericks, but it wasn&#8217;t a huge update and iOS took all the limelight.

This year however, might be totally opposite. <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/01/os-x-10-10-focus-planned-for-wwdc-ios-8-features-pushed-to-ios-8-1-new-apple-tv-os-in-the-works/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/01/os-x-10-10-focus-planned-for-wwdc-ios-8-features-pushed-to-ios-8-1-new-apple-tv-os-in-the-works/', 'According to 9to5Mac']);" >According to 9to5Mac</a>, Apple is set to revamp OS X with 10.10 update, bringing it on par with iOS in interface.

Apple has been bringing iOS features to OS X for quite some time now. It started with Lion, introducing LaunchPad, Calendar and Contacts apps etc. In Mountain Lion, we have seen Notification Center, Messages app and more.

This is going to continue in OS X 10.10. Aesthetics of iOS 7 will indeed make their way into OS X.

But what&#8217;s important is, will Apple dumb down OS X, to make it appealing for iOS users? 9to5Mac says, power user features like Mission Control, Finder etc. will be left untouched. Unlike Microsoft, Apple has no intentions of merging the two operating systems and only wants to bring design consistency between them.

It will be really weird to see OS X in the neon colours of iOS 7 and the glyph icons, but I&#8217;m sure Apple won&#8217;t go that far. Surely, Jony Ive knows what <a href="http://jonyiveredesignsthings.tumblr.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://jonyiveredesignsthings.tumblr.com/', 'people think about his design']);" >people think about his design</a>.

Webapps at <a href="http://icloud.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://icloud.com', 'iCloud.com']);" >iCloud.com</a>, like Calendar, Mail, Contacts etc. give a pretty good hint at what the revamp could look like.

While we&#8217;re not sure how this update will turn out, it&#8217;s good to see OS X getting focus at WWDC after a long time. Of course, this won&#8217;t be the only thing releasing. iOS 8, Apple TV upgrade and the one more thing (iWatch?) are on list.

This year&#8217;s WWDC is set to start on June 2nd at San Francisco. Are you looking forward to the event? Tell us in the comments.
