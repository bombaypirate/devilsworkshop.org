txtWeb is a ingenious service that links SMS and the internet. You can use SMS&#8217;s to get information on anything, get updates on anything and even access your social media accounts!

Think of txtWeb as a gateway to make searches on Google, get the latest sport, celebrities updates, check your train PNR status and do a lot more.

To use txtWeb, you&#8217;ll have to send command with the desired query to 9266592665 and you&#8217;ll get a SMS back with the response.

For example, if you send &#8216;**@pnralert 4215364712**&#8216;, you&#8217;ll receive a SMS showing your PNR status. The app also updates you if your status gets updated.

Here is another example. You can search anything on Google or Wikipedia like so : &#8216;**@okgoogle what is the time in Singapore**&#8216; or &#8216;**@wikipedia iPhone**&#8216; and you will receive responses real quick.

To get cricket updates, you can use &#8216;**@cricbuzz**&#8216; or &#8216;**@crinews**&#8216;

[Do you use iReff][2]? It&#8217;s an app that shows the recharge denominations for Indian mobile phones. iReff-txtWeb SMS app is available too! You can simply send a query with the command &#8216;**@ref**&#8216;. For example, sending &#8216;**@ref airtel SMS**&#8216; will respond you with the list of available SMS packs in your circle.

**Things to note :**

  1. It is a free service but, you&#8217;ll be charged national SMS charges based on your mobile network scheme.
  2. It is available only for Airtel, Idea, Tata Docomo and Vodafone users.
  3. You have only 25 requests initially. If you wish to send more requests to txtWeb, you&#8217;ll have to answer a few survey-type questions.

## txtWeb Android app

There is an Android app for the same. You can use the app both online and offline. Online usage is with 2G/3G data or WiFi connection, while the offline method uses your SMS plan to access the information.

Based on my experience, the user interface is not up to the expectations. But, the app doesn&#8217;t fail to deliver the results. It worked fast.

You can favorite services and use them quickly from the app.
