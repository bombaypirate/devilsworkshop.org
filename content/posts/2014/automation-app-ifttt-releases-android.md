IFTTT, short for &#8220;If This Then That&#8221;, is a great web service for automating tasks between internet services. It&#8217;s been a while since it has started and now it&#8217;s on Android (and iPhone too).

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-80394" alt="IFTTT" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2014/04/ifttt-337x600.png" width="337" height="600" />][1]

Most Android users would have heard about Tasker, an app which runs specific tasks based on the context. IFTTT is like Tasker, but for the web.

There&#8217;s a lot you can do with the service, most obvious ones are: changing your Twitter picture automatically as your Facebook picture is changed, getting a notification if it&#8217;s raining tomorrow, backing up your phone&#8217;s contacts to Google spreadsheets etc.

Now that IFTTT is available on Android, you can be even more creative. There are five new channels introduced: Android Device, Location, Phone call, Photos, SMS.

So if you&#8217;ve misplaced your phone which is on silent mode, you can increase the ringtone volume by sending an E-mail. This is possible because IFTTT now has permissions to control your Android device.
