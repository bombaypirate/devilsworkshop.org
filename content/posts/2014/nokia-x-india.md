Two weeks back Nokia announced the Nokia X family at the Mobile World Congress 2014 held at Barcelona. The Nokia X family consists of Nokia X, X+ and XL.

Immediately after launch, Nokia X was available in the US markets. The device is already listed in *<a href="http://www.themobilestore.in/mobiles-tablet/nokia-x-dual-sim/p-31103-68535339986-cat.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.themobilestore.in/mobiles-tablet/nokia-x-dual-sim/p-31103-68535339986-cat.html', 'The Mobile Store']);" >The Mobile Store</a>*. The device price is not available right now, but the page title says that the price is Rs 8,500. Also, it is said that the delivery will start from March 15.

Nokia X runs Android and is priced at 89 Euros. It has a 4 inch display with resolution 854 x 480, and is powered by a 1 GHz dual core Snapdragon 200 processor. It has a 3 MP camera at the back and comes with Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. It does not come with Google services. Instead Microsoft&#8217;s and Nokia&#8217;s services are bundled in it. You will find Bing, Nokia app store, Outlook and more in it.

Outlook and Bing are already available for every Android device. Why would anyone move to Nokia X and risk losing Google services? Basically, not having Google apps doesn&#8217;t give pure Android experience.

On a happy note, Nokia does give you an option to sideload Android APK files. But, you cannot be sure that all the Android apps will work with Nokia X. Nokia has requested developers to add a few extra lines of code to make their apps working on the Nokia X.

Also, there is now an <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=50707725" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=50707725', 'option to root']);" >option to root</a> Nokia X and bring Google services, including Google Play. Thanks to Kashamalaga, an Android developer.

Before rooting the Nokia X, you should remember that rooting the device removes Microsoft and Nokia services. In turn, this voids the device&#8217;s warranty.
