A new version of Paytm for Android is now available on Google Play. It brings a completely new user interface and Paytm&#8217;s *Bargain Chat*. Earlier, you could only make recharges for mobile phones, DTH, data cards, pay postpaid, landline and gas bills. Now, you can shop dresses, footwear, furniture and more.

Bargain Chat aims at remodeling the way buyers and sellers interact.

It allows the buyers to bargain with the sellers before purchasing products using Paytm app. When the seller agrees to your bargain, he/she will give you a *Bargain Code*. You can apply this code during checkout to get the discount that you asked for.

The *Bargain Chat* button is available in every product page, at the bottom left. Once you click it, it&#8217;ll connect you with the seller and you can bargain with the seller through text messages.

Some of the popular sellers include Yebhi, Yepme and Ferns N Petal.

There are many categories like *Men, Women, Sports and fitness, Home decor*. *Holi** special* is a special category that will be available for a limited time now.

The best thing about this update is that, you can use your Paytm cash not only to recharge, but also to make payments for shopping. In the near future, you will be able to use the Paytm cash for paying your education fees too.

You can continue to choose Paytm coupons in this new version. There is an option to enter promo codes too.
