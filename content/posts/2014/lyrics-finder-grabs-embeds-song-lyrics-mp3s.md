If you like to keep your Music library complete or like to sing along to your songs, here&#8217;s a great little app called Lyrics Finder.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-80406" alt="Lyrics Finder" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-28-at-2.09.15-pm-600x391.png" width="600" height="391" />][1]

Lyrics Finder scans your music library for MP3s and downloads the lyrics.

To get started, drag-and-drop a file or a folder containing MP3s.

You&#8217;ll of course need to make sure your Music Player app supports lyrics, otherwise there&#8217;s no point in embedding lyrics inside the MP3s.

For example, on Android, there&#8217;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer', 'Poweramp']);" >Poweramp</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player', 'Shuttle']);" >Shuttle</a> and more music players which support lyrics. On Mac, I use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/muzzy-for-itunes/id595452407?mt=12" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/muzzy-for-itunes/id595452407?mt=12', 'Muzzy']);" >Muzzy</a>, a great mini player for iTunes.

If an MP3 file already has lyrics, then the app leaves it intact, i.e. no overriding.

Searching and downloading lyrics is pretty fast, it took less than a minute to grab lyrics for 400 songs in my iTunes library. A green indicator is shown on the song&#8217;s album art, if lyrics were available for that song (see the above screenshot).

Lyrics Finder is available for OS X and Windows, the link is below.
