Samsung announced it&#8217;s next flagship phone, the Samsung Galaxy S5 at the Mobile World Congress 2014, held at Barcelona. This smartphone comes similar to it&#8217;s predecessor, except that it is packed with a better camera, bigger size, fingerprint sensor and a heart rate monitor. And, the device is waterproof!

The 5.1 inch Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a new back look that offers a better grip. If you are familiar with the original Nexus 7 launched in 2012, the Samsung Galaxy S5 looks more like the original Nexus 7. Talking about the hardware features, it comes with a 2.5 Ghz quad core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2 GB RAM and offers 16 GB or 32 GB internal memory. You can also expand the memory up to 128 GB.<figure id="attachment_79785" style="width: 463px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
