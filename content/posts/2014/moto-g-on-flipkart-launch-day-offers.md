It&#8217;s official. Just like [Motorola hinted][1], Moto X has come to India.

The Black and White pieces are available in stock right now, while the wood variants will be on pre-order and be delivered in the second week of April.

Moto Maker and Moto Skip, the wearable device to easily unlock your Moto X without punching your pin/password every time, will not be available in India for now.

Flipkart will be selling only the 16 GB version of Moto X for now. The device is a single SIM variant.

They will also be offering cash on delivery (COD) and In-a-day guarantee irrespective of the payment option.

Similar to [Moto G launch][3], Flipkart is bringing many interesting launch day offers. The three launch day offers are :

  * Rs 1000 cashback on purchase using the 6 months EMI option.
  * Flat 70% offer on Moto X cases.
  * 10 lucky winners get 100% cashback. Just like Moto G launch, the cashback will be provided in the Flipkart Wallet.

These offers will be applicable for orders placed today only.

**Will Moto X launch in India be successful? **

Moto X has a display of 4.7 inch. It is powered by a 1.7 GHz dual core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, Adreno 320 GPU and 2 GB RAM. It comes with a 10 MP camera at the rear and a 2 MP camera at the front.

It will run Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box and that&#8217;s one of the selling points.

Motorola has kept the Stock UI for most part, adding a few exclusive features like ActiveDisplay, Touch Less control and Quick Capture Camera.

First, the device is too late to the Indian market. It was announced in August, 2013 in the United States.

Next, looking at the price tag, the Nexus 5 from Google costs an additional Rs 6000, but comes with better hardware. Also, Nexus devices promise latest software updates.

Nexus 4 can be a good choice too at this price.

Looking at the bright side, Google cut the price tag from the announced $550 to $399 in the United States in January, 2014. It was done to have a bigger impact at the markets outside the United States. Priced low in India, it could actually have a good impact despite the late arrival to the India markets.
