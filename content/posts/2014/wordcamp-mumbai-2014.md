Last month I wrote about the [WordCamp culture in India][1]. In it I mentioned briefly about WordCamp Mumbai. WordCamps are basically WordPress informal conferences. The idea is for WordPress enthusiasts from a particular city meet-up and interact with the other WordPress enthusiasts and experts from all over the country. It is ideally an annual event.

Mumbai will host it&#8217;s second WordCamp (first one was in 2012) this weekend ***(15-16 March, 2014)***. I have attended a few WordCamps and they usually end up being informative and a lot of fun. It is always a lot of fun to see interesting new ways WordPress is used.

I am personally involved in WordCamp Mumbai 2014 as an organizer. For DW&#8217;s parent company rtCamp too, this WordCamp will be a very special one as <a href="https://rtcamp.com/easyengine/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://rtcamp.com/easyengine/', 'EasyEngine']);" >EasyEngine</a> &#8211; a CLI tool that helps users to easily manage their WordPress sites on Nginx will be introduced to the community. [Rahul Bansal][2] will be speaking on it in a session.
