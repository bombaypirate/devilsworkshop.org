Heartbleed, a recently discovered OpenSSL security bug has created fears in the minds of many Internet users. OpenSSL provides communication security to web, email, instant messaging and various virtual private networks too.

<a href="http://heartbleed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://heartbleed.com/', 'Heartbleed']);" >Heartbleed</a> is a serious flaw in the OpenSSL security system that allows any person to access the memory of the systems of the client or sever and get information.

This security flaw has been found in only certain versions of OpenSSL software. Android devices use OpenSSL software. Based on reports, Google has confirmed that Android 4.1.1 is vulnerable. To check if your device is affected by Heartbleed, a new app from Lookout Mobile Security is available and is called Heartbleed Detector.

Heartbleed Detector is a free app on the Google Play store and supports all Android devices running Android 2.2 and above. Once you download and install the app, it automatically scans your device and tells you if your device is vulnerable or not.

As for me, my Android device is running a version of OpenSSL that is affected by Heartbleed, but there are no serious issues that I should pay attention to. My device is safe.

This app will not scan the apps on your Android. So, you will not be able to check if your online accounts are vulnerable to Heartbleed.

## Solution to save your Android device from Heartbleed

As of now there is no option to save your Android from this bug. Google is currently working on a patch and will send the update through mobile carriers. To update your Android software, go to **Settings > About > Software Update.**

If you are worried about waiting for Google&#8217;s patch and want to safeguard your Android device, consider installing Android anti-virus apps from Google Play Store.

## LastPass Heartbleed Checker

LastPass, a password manager, has launched its own Heartbleed checker. It allows you to type a website address and shows if it is vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug. It also gives an in depth analysis of which version of OpenSSL the website is on and if the website is patched from the bug.
