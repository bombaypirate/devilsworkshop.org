**Buying suggestions**

If you are planning to get a daily driver with a decent hardware and software specifications, Xiaomi Mi 3 is one good device to go with. 

Other alternatives in the price range can be Moto G, Sony Xperia M 2 Dual. But if you are rooting for a device that can actually perform faster and better than other similar devices, Xiaomi Mi 3 is your best shot. 

**Success in sight for Xiaomi?**

If you didn&#8217;t know, India is the third largest smartphone market, after United States of America and China. With Samsung dominating the smartphone market in India, Android is the most widely used mobile platform. 

With Xiaomi&#8217;s launch, chances are that the company might see success like Motorola which recently sold 10 lakh smartphone units in India in the past five months. On the other hand, Nokia sold a relatively smaller figure of 7 lakh smartphone units. 

Huga Barra, an ex-Android engineer joined Xiaomi last year and is the International Vice President of Xiaomi. Based on reports, he claims that the company isn&#8217;t expecting profits in the near future. But, considering that Android is the Indians&#8217; favorite smartphone OS, Xiaomi Mi 3 might really find success in this new market. Also, the other two budget smartphones Redmi 1S and Redmi Note will be going for launch in the mid August and late August respectively. 

Xiaomi has also setup 20 service centers in some of the biggest cities of India. There are also 2 exclusive Xiaomi centers in New Delhi and Bangalore. A 24/7 hotline is also setup.
