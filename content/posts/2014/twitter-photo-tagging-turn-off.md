Today, Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/photos-just-got-more-social" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://blog.twitter.com/2014/photos-just-got-more-social', 'announced']);" >announced</a> a new feature that allows users to upload multiple photos on a single tweet. More important feature is the new option that will allow users to tag other users to photos. The new feature will be available to iPhone users first and then later to Android users. Twitter.com will see this feature last.

I own an Android phone, hence I could not check the new feature out for myself. But Twitter has posted this helpful image that illustrates how the new photo-tagging feature will work.

This could be an issue as Twitter is a very public platform and just about anyone can tag anyone on Twitter by default to a photo. Thankfully the privacy options does offer control over who gets to tag you in photos.

### How to turn of photo-tagging on your Twitter account:

  * Log in to your Twitter account on a desktop computer.
  * Then look up Settings and Security at the following link https://twitter.com/settings/security<figure id="attachment_80118" style="width: 577px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The default option selected is to &#8220;Allow anyone to tag me in photos&#8221;. Change it to not allow anyone to tag you in photos or limite tagging to only people you follow.

Since this is a opt-out feature and not a opt-in feature, I am sure there will be some people who will find strangers tagging them in photos an unwanted headache.
