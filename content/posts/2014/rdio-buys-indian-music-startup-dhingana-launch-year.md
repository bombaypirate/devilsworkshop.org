Here&#8217;s some exciting news for Music addicts in India. <a href="http://www.dhingana.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dhingana.com/', 'Dhingana']);" >Dhingana</a>, a popular Indian Music streaming service which was shut down this month, is bought by Rdio.

If you didn&#8217;t know, Rdio is one of the best Music streaming services, not yet available in India though.

So here&#8217;s the big news: Rdio is coming to India.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80045" alt="Dhingana" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2014/03/dhingana.jpg" width="600" height="300" />][1]

If you&#8217;re in India and want to use Rdio, you should stick to a [VPN like Hola Unblocker][2] and even then you won&#8217;t be able to get it to work on Mobile.

Apparently, if Rdio comes to India, we&#8217;ll be able to use it without having to trick anything. Expect ad-supported free Music streaming and premium plans on other side.

Rdio currently charges 9.99$/MO for its Unlimited subscription &#8211; Web and Mobile access. For Web-only subscription, it&#8217;s 4.99$/MO.

I&#8217;m pretty sure these plans won&#8217;t work in India. Remember [Flipkart&#8217;s Flyte][3]? That&#8217;ll repeat again. Only difference is that, Rdio being a huge player in music streaming industry, will be fine even with losses.

I currently subscribe to [Spotify using Entropay][4]. That might change, if Rdio comes to India, and lower the prices a bit. There&#8217;s neck-to-neck competition between both of these services.

There&#8217;s no ETA given yet on release of Rdio/Dhingana in India.
