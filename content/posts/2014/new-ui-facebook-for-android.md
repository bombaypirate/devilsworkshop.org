The current Facebook for Android group is a mess. Everyone knows that. The app is slow, lags and many users have even experienced problems with crashing often.

If you didn&#8217;t know, [Facebook has a Alpha Testers group][1] that allows the Android users to test the Facebook app updates before they are rolled out to the public.

The above shown image is that of the new Facebook for Android that Facebook has been working on. Based on first impressions, the app is fast and fluid. Scrolling across the posts, navigation is smooth, multimedia upload/download is flawless and the app didn&#8217;t crash. Simply said, this version is much better than the previous ones.
