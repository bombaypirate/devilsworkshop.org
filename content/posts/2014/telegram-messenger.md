Telegram messenger is a new instant messaging app. It is a secure, fast and reliable means for instant messaging and is available for Android and iOS devices for now.

Telegram messenger has been designed to look a lot like WhatsApp, but the former has a couple of brilliant features that are limited in latter.

To begin with, this service claims to be faster than any other instant messaging service. It is fast in delivering the messages and offers read reports with check marks, just like WhatsApp. The app claims to run perfect even with the weakest mobile signals.<figure id="attachment_79544" style="width: 420px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Similar to WhatsApp, your Telegram messenger account is linked to your mobile number, but there is an option to log out of your account when needed. It is free, without ads, and the developers claim that it will remain free forever.

It even has WhatsApp emoticons!

## Interesting Telegram features

**Privacy &#8211;**** **You can create *Secret Chats* with your friends. If you start a *Secret Chat* with your friend, your friend will have to accept that invitation.

Once done, your messages won&#8217;t be recorded by the Telegram messenger servers. Also, you have an option to make the messages self-destruct in few seconds to minutes. This is a quality privacy feature that many would love to have.

Click the photo of your friend at the top right in the *Secret Chat* and you can set the the self-destruct message timing in an option available there.

**100 members in a group chat &#8211; **With Telegram messenger, you can make group chats with as much as 100 friends.

WhatsApp offers 50 members in a group limit.

**Unlimited storage ****&#8211;** You can send media upto 1 GB in-a-go over Telegram messenger. It is said that the app offers unlimited media storage in a cloud storage. This way, you can access your messages and media from several devices!

You can also send files of any format! This way, you can send MP3, PDF and other files that can&#8217;t be send on WhatsApp.

Based on the first impressions, the app looked brilliant to me. It&#8217;s WhatsApp with better security features.
