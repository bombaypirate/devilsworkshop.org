Facebook Messenger for Windows Phone is now available. There may be many apps in the Windows market that mimick the Facebook Messenger, but this is the official app by Facebook.

Facebook Messenger allows you to connect easily with your Facebook friends. You can send messages, share multimedia files, location and more. Similar to the Android and iOS versions, Facebook Messenger for Windows Phone comes with Facebook stickers. But it misses voice messaging and *Chat Heads* options. These features should be coming in the near future.

It needs Windows 8 to run. It comes with the traditional Windows Phone style user interface.

Facebook has now killed off the Facebook Messenger app for Windows desktop and Firefox browser. Rumors about Facebook Messenger for Mac OS X may not be true considering Facebook is dropping support for desktop messaging.
