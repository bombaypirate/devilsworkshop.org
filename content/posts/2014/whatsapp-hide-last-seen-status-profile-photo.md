A new APK file is now available on the WhatsApp website that lets you hide your *Last seen* timestamp, status and profile photo. This new feature is not available officially on the Google Play store yet.

You can *either hide these details from everyone*, including your contacts and strangers, or choose to let it be *visible for everyone*. You cannot hide the details from particular contacts.<figure style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**Note** : On hiding your *Last Seen* status, you won&#8217;t be able to see your contacts&#8217; *Last Seen* status.

If you didn&#8217;t know, the iOS version of WhatsApp already has this feature and allows the users to hide the *Last Seen* tag. But, it comes with a limitation. You cannot change the setting every now and then. You will have to wait for one day to toggle the setting again.

Also, the iOS feature doesn&#8217;t let you hide your status and profile photo.

Talking about this feature for WhatsApp for other platforms, there are no reports yet. But, if the users find this feature useful, WhatsApp will be bringing this feature to the other devices soon.

Before you download the APK, it is suggested that you take a [backup of your existing WhatsApp using MyAppSharer][2] or any other method that you prefer.
