TimePIN is nifty Android app that adds better security measures to your phone. It is different from the other lockscreen apps for Android because it changes the password every minute, based on the device time.

## Advantages of using TimePIN

Here are few reasons why you should use TimePIN.

  1. A safe, complicated password is generated every minute and you&#8217;re the *only person* who knows that password.
  2. Forget worrying about password stealing eyes that are lurking near you.
  3. Easy and immediate access to device without remembering complicated passwords.

If the time is 09:54, your pin would be 0954. And, when the time is 00:00, your pin is 0000.

You may now wonder that when an attacker gets his hands on your device, he may easily unlock the device with the time being shown on the device. But, that&#8217;s not the case.

The app comes with *modifiers*. Modifiers are a set of rules upon which the pins are generated. There are four modifiers. They are :

  1. **Reverse : **This modifier reverses your pin. If the time is 12:34, the pin is 4321.
  2. **Double : **It doubles your pin. If the time is 12:34, the pin is 12341234.
  3. **Mirror : **It mirrors your pin. If the time is 12:34, the pin is 12344321. If the time is 8:32, the pin is 08322380.
  4. **Offset : **This modifier generates the pin based on the time and then subtracts that with the offset value set by you. If the time is 12:34 and the offset value is 121, the final pin is 1113 (1234 &#8211; 121)

At any time, if multiple pins are enabled, they will be applied based on the order shown in the TimePIN app.

TimePIN is a free app. Only the **Reverse **modifier is available for free in the app. Other modifiers can be purchased with an in-app purchase priced at $1.99.



**Default pin**

A default pin can be set in the app during the first launch of the app. If you ever get locked out of your device, simply reboot the device, and once it restarts, enter the default pin to access your device again.

You can change the default pin anytime you want. Also, this default pin is required to access the app every time.

**Upcoming features**

The developer has mentioned that he has some interesting features coming soon. They include support for encrypted devices, support for pattern passwords, alphanumeric passwords and more modifiers.

The app doesn&#8217;t need root access. But upcoming features like support for encrypted devices and pattern passwords may need root access.
