Back in January, Flipkart launched In-a-day delivery. And now, Flipkart is offering Same-day delivery in a view to deliver better services to the customers and compete with the fast growing Amazon India. 

Starting from today, Flipkart&#8217;s Same-day delivery will be available for deliveries to 10 cities : Delhi, Chennai, Faridabad, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Gurgaon, Bangalore, Manesar and Kolkata. Flipkart&#8217;s In-a-day delivery covers 27 cities as of now. <figure style="width: 373px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

If you place an order before 12 noon on a business day, the product will be delivered by 9 pm on the same day. As a promotional offer, Flipkart is offering Same-day delivery at just Rs 140 per item and this offer is only from April 28 to 30. 

Also, Flipkart is offering Rs 5000 in Flipkart wallet if the courier partner fails to deliver the product on the same as promised. You can make this cash for future purchases at Flipkart. This cash is not refundable to your bank account. 

Before you make the purchase, make sure to check if your pincode is covered by this service. Also note that only a few products by certain sellers are qualified for this service. 

Similar to In-a-day delivery service, the shipment price will be collected as a part of the order and will be refunded to your Flipkart wallet if the order is not delivered as promised. 

## Pricing by other companies

The pricing is little high when compared with the One-day or Two-days delivery service offered by Amazon India. Amazon India offers One-day delivery at Rs 90 per order and Two-days delivery at Rs 70 per order. 

On the other day, Snapdeal and Tradus are offering One-day delivery services free of charge.
