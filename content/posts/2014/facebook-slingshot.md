Facebook has officially announced the launch of Slingshot app for iPhone and Android. It was leaked accidentally a week back before Facebook took down the app soon. The app allows you to send and receive photo or video messages that self-destruct after viewing. Yes, it does look similar to Snapchat, but it comes with a different working mechanism.

In Snapchat, you can see the photo or video that your friend sent and then respond with a similar one. But with Slingshot, *you will be able to see what your friend sent only when you send one back yourself*. You can use your rear camera to shoot a normal photo or video or the front one for a selfie. You can enable or disable Flash too.

When you receive a Sling from your friend, it is *Locked* by default. *Locked* Slings are pixelated and can&#8217;t be viewed as a normal photo or video. To *Unlock* the Sling, shoot a Sling of your own and send to that friend to *Unlock* the Sling he/she sent.<figure id="attachment_80801" style="width: 337px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

You will be able to see only the Pixelated view.</figcaption></figure> 

Once *Unlocked*, you can either tap the Sling to respond with one back, or simply swipe away the Sling to discard it. Do remember that once you swipe away the Sling, the message will no longer be available for your view.<figure id="attachment_80802" style="width: 337px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Slings can also be customized with a text message (limited to 140 characters). You can also draw something on your Slings before Slinging them.

There is an option to Sling to all your friends too. Simply click the *Select All* button while you are about to Sling your message.



Since the messages self-destruct automatically, the photos and videos that you send or receive are not stored locally on your device. But, there is an option to opt-in to save your images to your local storage &#8211; check the Settings section inside the app.

The app is made by Facebook Creative Labs, the same team that made the [Facebook Paper app][4]. Slingshot is available for free on the iTunes App Store and the Google Play store, but is limited to the United States for now. As for the Android users, the Slingshot APK is already available on the internet.
