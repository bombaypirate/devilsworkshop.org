Motorola has announced that it is bringing the Moto X to India in the next few weeks. It will be available in Australia too. The announcement comes from the <a href="https://twitter.com/Motorola/status/438401118687604736?p=v" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/Motorola/status/438401118687604736?p=v', 'official tweet from Motorola']);" >official tweet from Motorola</a>.

At this moment, Moto X has been available only in the US, UK, Germany and Mexico and Latin America.

[Similar to Moto G][2], it is expected that Motorola will be selling the Moto X only on Flipkart. This strategy has worked well for Motorola, except that the demand for the [low cost Moto G was huge in India][3] that it went *out of stock* every now and then.

The price tag is unknown, but it should cost more than Moto G.

The launch in India will not come with <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker', 'Moto Maker']);" >Moto Maker</a>. The Moto Maker is available only the US for now. It allows the buyers to customize the Moto X to their needs. They can choose the front and back panel colors, camera rim and more. Over 2000 combinations are possible, says Motorola. Once designed, the Moto X will be delivered straight to their doors.

**About Moto X**

The Moto X comes with a 1.7 GHz dual core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB RAM, 4.7 inch 720p HD AMOLED display, 10MP rear camera, 2MP front camera and has 16GB/32GB internal storage. It comes with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean out of the box. But, a promised Android KitKat update is available.

Moto X comes with PixelClear technology and has Active Display. Active Display displays your notifications in a brilliant way that the screen doesn&#8217;t light up. Only the notifications are shown with a black screen covering the rest of the area. If you wish to get this feature on your Android, you should [try ActiveNotifications][4].

Moto X is well known for its brilliant voice recognizing feature. The device [hears you all the time][5]. You can give voice commands even when the device display is turned off and it will respond you.

**Motorola&#8217;s next plans**

Motorola has announced that the Moto Maker will be available to Western Europe and Mexico in the next few months. And, if Moto X finds success in India, Moto Maker may be available in India too.

Based on reports, Motorola is developing a Moto X2, the next generation of Moto X. It is believed to go official in the late summer of 2014.

Also, Motorola is making its first smart watch. It is said that Motorola is keeping the smart watch high on style and design. It will be available later in this year.
