It&#8217;s official finally. Moto G is here. It is scheduled to be available from February 5, 2014, report various blogs. It is said that Motorola won&#8217;t be selling Moto G in brick-and-mortar shops. It would be selling the Moto G only online and Flipkart looks like the official launch partner for the device.

The <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/motorola" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flipkart.com/motorola', 'Moto G page on Flipkart']);" >Moto G page on Flipkart</a>Â does not mention the launch date or the price tag. But it says, &#8216;*Buy a Moto G on the day of launch and avail incredible offers*&#8216; For a country like India, it should be that Flipkart is bringing in some quality EMI payment options as it is the norm here.

During the launch of Moto G in November, Google announced that Moto G would be coming to India in January. And here it is now, a month late. Maybe that&#8217;s because of the [recent selling of Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 billion][2].

Talking about purchase and services, it looks like Motorola will be handling those as it is just a few days since Lenovo bought Motorola. There are no official updates on this though.

The Moto G comes with a 4.5 inch 720p display and has 1.2 GHz quad core Snapdragon 400 processor. It has 1 GB RAM and is available in two variants : 8 GB, 16 GB. It will be available with Android 4.3, Jelly Bean, straight out of the box. But a 4.4 KitKat update is promised.

Being a mid range device, the device is supposed to be priced at 15,000 INR. It is available in the United States at $179 for the 8 GB variant and $199 for the 16 GB variant.
