Few months ago, I moved from Airtel to Idea and suddenly I started getting a lot of telemarketing calls. It wasted a lot of my time as I was under the impression, DND was active on my account.

It turned out that Airtel removed me from DND when I decided to get away from them. Among telemarketing calls, there were calls from Airtel also.

## Check Status

You may call 1909 to enquire current status and know your NDNC registration date.

I prefer the online way. You can check DND status online using this official link <a href="http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/search.misc" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/search.misc', 'http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/search.misc']);" >http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/search.misc</a> for any number!

Below is what I saw for my number:

</p>

As you can see, DND was de-activated on my number on January 9, 2014. I switched from Airtel to Idea around same date.

Does it happen always? Do you expect DND to get deactivated when you switch from one provider to another provider? Not sure. I have one more number and when we switched it from BSNL to Idea, it&#8217;s DND remained active!

</p>

If you are getting calls from number starting with 0140 then you may not be on DND or getting a call from somebody who doesn&#8217;t respect DND!

## Activate DND (Do Not Disturb)

As I was removed from DND, I had to activate it again.

### To Stop ALL Calls

Send SMS with the message **Start 0** to **1909**.

You can will get a reply by SMS asking for confirmation. Send another message with a letter **Y** to confirm.

If you don&#8217;t like typing, you can also call 1909 from your mobile and follow instructions.

### To allow calls of particular category

Category selection 0 in **Start 0** blocks all categories. If you wan&#8217;t to allow some categories only, below is a list of category numbers.

  1. Banking/Insurance/Financial products/credit cards
  2. Real Estate
  3. Education
  4. Health
  5. Consumer goods and automobiles
  6. Communication/Broadcasting/Entertainment/IT
  7. Tourism and Leisure

To allow category specific calls, type **Start 1** for Banking/Insurance, etc category.

You can specify multiple category as well by typing **Start 1,2** in SMS.

## Register a complaint

If DND is active on your number and you are still getting calls, you can register a complaint about calls to your service provider.I was under the impression that complaints need to be made directly to TRAI or some government authority.

### By SMS

You can send a SMS to 1909 in following format to register your complain.

<pre><code class="no-highlight">the unsolicited commercial communication, XXXXXXXXXX, dd/mm/yy</code></pre>

Or another format:

<pre><code class="no-highlight">COMP TEL NO XXXXXXXXXX, dd/mm/yy, Time hh:mm</code></pre>

Replace **XXXXXXXXXX** by number from which you received call and **dd/mm/yy** and **hh:mm** with date & time, respectively.

### Check complaint status

You will get a complaint number, whose status can be tracked online from <a href="http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/UccSearch.misc" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/UccSearch.misc', 'http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/UccSearch.misc']);" >http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/UccSearch.misc</a>

<span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4286em; line-height: 1.05em;">Android App</span>

There is an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deepakj.smspam" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deepakj.smspam', 'Android App to register complains easily here']);" >Android App to register complains easily here</a>. (thanks <a href="http://anantshri.info" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://anantshri.info', 'anantshri']);" >anantshri</a>)

## Important Notes

If you are moving from one service provider to another service provider, under MNP (mobile number portability) scheme. and you suddenly starts getting a lot of telemarketing calls, it&#8217;s better to check your number&#8217;s DND status online.
