Apple [didn&#8217;t bring a cheap iPhone 4][1] earlier. Now, the latest reports by many <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/17/apple-turns-to-old-iphone-models-and-lower-prices-to-woo-users-in-india/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/17/apple-turns-to-old-iphone-models-and-lower-prices-to-woo-users-in-india/', 'leading technology blogs']);" title="iPhone 4 relaunch in India - TechCrunch">leading technology blogs</a> claim that Apple is likely to re-launch iPhone 4 at 23,000 INR in the Indian markets. iPhone 4 is the fourth generation iPhone in the series and was announced roughly three years back.

Apple has stopped producing iPhone 4 last August and still has many unsold iPhone 4 devices in it&#8217;s inventories worldwide. This is why Apple has decided to bring these devices to the Indian markets. Initially reported to sell at 15,000 INR, it is reported that Apple might place the price tag at 23,000 INR with EMI, and carrier tie-ups.

Though [it looks cheap][2], there are many reasons why Indians should not choose the iPhone 4.

## Outdated hardware

The smartphone industry has come a long way since iPhone 4&#8217;s launch. Compared to the latest 2014 smartphones, the 1 GHz cortex-A8 processor powered iPhone 4 looks pretty lame. It comes with 5 MP camera, 512 MB RAM, 3.5 inch display and 1420 mAh battery.

Combine these specs with iOS 7 aka the memory hog and you have a phone which struggles to do simple things.

## Stripped iOS 7 on iPhone 4

When it was launched, the iPhone 4 came with iOS 4. It later got upgraded to iOS 6.1.4 and now, iOS 7.0.4 is available for the iPhone 4.

But, this version of iOS 7 doesn&#8217;t do any magic. Most of the iPhone 4 users have started complaining about the lag while using apps, reduced functionality and speed of the device.

Also, this version of iOS doesn&#8217;t bring AirDrop or filters for Camera app on iPhone 4. No Siri either. Also, once you upgrade to iOS 7 on your iPhone 4, there is no option to downgrade to iOS 6.

The outdated hardware on iPhone 4 simply doesn&#8217;t withstand iOS 7.

## Better competitive phones are available now

The Lumia 1320 from Nokia is a good option if you love Windows Phone. With a 6 inch display, Dual core 1.7 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, it is a good smartphone that you can choose. It is priced at 23K, the same as the about-to-relaunch-iPhone 4.

If you want to go the Android way, there are many devices from Samsung and the Indian manufacturer Micromax. Samsung Galaxy Grand, Micromax Canvas A116 HD are good choices. The Galaxy Grand from Samsung is available at just 15K!

Remember Moto G launch? Motorola promised to bring Moto G to the Indian markets in the month of January. It should happen any time now.

The Moto G comes with the latest Android KitKat, 1 GB RAM 4.5 inch display, 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor and a 5 MP camera.

What&#8217;s your thoughts on the upcoming re-launch of iPhone 4? Are you an Indian and do you wish to buy the iPhone 4, or opt a better smartphone?

if you still wish to buy the iPhone 4, it&#8217;s already <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/apple-iphone-4/p/itmdkmjudzfchzf5" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flipkart.com/apple-iphone-4/p/itmdkmjudzfchzf5', 'available on Flipkart']);" title="iPhone 4 on Flipkart">available on Flipkart</a> at 22,649 INR.
