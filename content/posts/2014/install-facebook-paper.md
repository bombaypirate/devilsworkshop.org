[<img class="aligncenter size-full" title="Facebook Paper.jpg" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2014/02/wpid-Facebook-Paper.jpg" />][2]

Open App Store on your iPhone or iPad. Tap the *Featured* section in the bottom left of the app. Scroll to the bottom and you&#8217;ll see your Apple ID there. Tap it.

Then, in the pop-up menu that appears, click *View Apple ID* and then you&#8217;ll be asked to enter your Apple ID password. Once entered, you&#8217;ll find an option there to change the country. Set the country to US.<figure style="width: 451px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

You&#8217;ll be asked to accept the new Terms and Conditions. Once done, choose *None* while Apple asks for a valid payment option.

**Note** : If you have pending non-US Apple credits or iTunes Match subscription, or iTunes Pass, you&#8217;ll be in trouble. You&#8217;ll have to either to finish your credits and then change your country to US. Or, you can login from iTunes desktop app and sign up for a new US account. Note that you&#8217;ll need a US address and credit card.

Also, your existing credit card details will be lost when change countries.Â You can now download and install the Facebook Paper app on your iPhone or iPad.
