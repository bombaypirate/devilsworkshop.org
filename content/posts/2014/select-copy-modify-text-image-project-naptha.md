Have you ever thought if there was a way to select and modify text inside an image? It&#8217;s possible now, with just a Chrome extension.

That&#8217;s right. With this extension, you can treat text inside image, as normal text. It&#8217;s called Project Naptha.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-80427" alt="Selecting text inside image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-30-at-9.29.14-pm-447x600.png" width="447" height="600" />][1]

Project Naptha applies OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on all the images in the browser, allowing you to select text and do things like copy, erase, modify, translate and more.

It works as expected, for most images, especially for screenshots and other text embedded images. Apparently, no OCR technology is perfect.

To use it, just hover your cursor on text in an image, and just start selecting. You&#8217;ll see the text highlighted with transparent blue colour. You can then right click and perform some action on the text &#8211; like, search text on Google, erase it from image, translate it into other languages and so on.

Even thought it sounds like this extension needs a lot of processing power, it runs just fine. No crashes or memory hogging till now.

It&#8217;s only available for Chrome right now. The developer says there will be a Firefox add-on releasing in a few days.

So if you&#8217;re on Chrome, head on to Chrome Webstore and try out this nifty extension.
