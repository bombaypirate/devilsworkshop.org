Google had added the feature to save a map offline, for phones long ago. This is useful when sometimes you do not have connectivity. The feature even though available for a while, was not used as by many people. The main reason being that the option was not visible enough or rather hidden too well for normal users to discover it and use it. Most people who use Google Maps do so while travelling for a quick reference, so most do not have time to spend looking at each of its features.

Today in a new update, Google Maps has introduced a more prominent &#8220;Save to Offline&#8221; button.<figure id="attachment_80474" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

There are some other major upgrades and changes introduced too like integration with Uber. Another good addition is Google Maps showing which lane to stay in before taking a turn. This will be a lot more useful to anticipate where exactly you need to watch out for the right or left turn.

Finally there are some smaller additions which will be useful for business like showing closing times (last call) and can filter places based on prices and even user ratings.

Google Maps is still vastly more popular and honestly as a user myself, I think it is vastly better than all alternatives out there. Google should be commended on investing even more time and energy than it did before despite its leadership role. But this might be mainly because Google Maps is a product that is hugely important to collect data of the real world around us that users generate.

The updates are rolling out today itself on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps', 'Android']);" >Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8', 'iOS ']);" >iOS </a>versions.
