From being a mobile phone manufacturer, after [selling itself to Microsoft][1], Nokia is fast developing into a software maker now. Nokia announced it&#8217;s first Android app and is calling it *Z Launcher*.

The launcher learns from your using of your smartphone and suggests the top apps to you at the right time. It&#8217;s not just the apps. The launcher learns from your web browsing history too.

It keeps suggesting you apps and content to access during different time phases &#8211; morning and evening to name a few. That is, the launcher will offer different apps when you are at work during morning and different ones when you are at home during evening.<figure id="attachment_80812" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The time and calendar widgets are shown above the apps suggestion. Five static apps are shown at the bottom of the apps suggestions.

Another unique feature is *Scribble*. Just scribble the first letter of the app that you wish to open and all the apps with that starting letter will be shown. You can access apps quickly this way. If you wish to open Uber app, scribble &#8216;U&#8217; on the screen. (Check the video below)



The launcher is in beta form right now and is available for download for a quite few interested users. A dedicated website has been setup for the launcher. Interested users can connect with their Google account, download the APK file and try this new launcher on their device.

The launcher is available only for top selling models like Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, S5 and the Nexus 5 running Android 4.1 and above. The app is not optimized for tablets.
