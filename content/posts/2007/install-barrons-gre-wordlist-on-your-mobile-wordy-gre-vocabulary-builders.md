If you are a student preparing for GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) then I hope you are familiar with Barron&#8217;s GRE word list. Most of you may have purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764178784?ie=UTF8&tag=devilsworksho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0764178784" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764178784?ie=UTF8&tag=devilsworksho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0764178784', 'How to Prepare for the GRE with CD-ROM (Barron&#8217;s How to Prepare for the Gre Graduate Record Examination)(16th Edition)']);" >How to Prepare for the GRE with CD-ROM (Barron&#8217;s How to Prepare for the Gre Graduate Record Examination)(16th Edition)</a>.<img class="wp-image-51585" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=devilsworksho-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0764178784" style="border: medium none  ! important;margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />

Even I do have Barron&#8217;s book, but due to my tight work schedule and DW (and gals too ðŸ˜‰ I hardly get time for going through wordlists provided in Barron&#8217;s book. Moreover I know 3500+ words can not be done overnight. So I decided to look for some application which I can install on my mobile. As of now I have found two kool applications by which I can utilize my all spare time going through these wordlists. Here are my reviews about two **offline dictionaries that doesn&#8217;t required internet connection**!

***Requirement*: **Following are Java applications i.e. **jar files** so they will work on almost every Java enabled phone.

**1. Wordy** (Freeware)

This one is my favorite. Really simple interface! Developed by Murali Krishnan.

Only **three keys** needed to navigate throughout the wordlist.

  * *** (star)** â€œ for previous word is list
  * **0 (zero)** â€œ for random word
  * **\# (hash)** â€œ for next word

Also you can type a word of your choice to get its meaning instantly!

**2. GRE Vocabulary Builders** (USD $19.99)

  * It contains Barron&#8217;s GRE Word list (4839 words and definitions)
  * It also contains Most Common GRE Word list (1178 words & definitions)
  * **5 Vocabulary builder games** help you to learn words & definitions
  * Searching is very fast and list of words is provided as you type.
  * A **diary** is provided to write short notes.

This is good too in terms of functionality but in terms of interface Wordy wins! Also **$19.99** is cost to consider.
