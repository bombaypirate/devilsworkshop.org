Certainly this is one of the most awaited feature on orkut! Other social networking sites like facebook, linkedin, etc had it from day one. And many not so popular social networking sites use this to welcome newly registered members under captions like *invite your yahoo, hotmail, etc friends to blahblah site&#8230;*

Now orkut bridged the gap by giving this feature to limited orkut users with Gmail account. Just Click on **Find Friends** as highlighted in above screenshot and you will be taken to next page as shown below from where you can choose to add your friends who are already on orkut or simply invite who has not yet joined the orkut!

**#Some limitation of this cool feature&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />**

  * The **find friends** box will not appear if you do not use gmail or use gmail but its login is different from your orkut login.
  * This feature is only available for your Gmail contact list. orkut doesn&#8217;t import address books from other email servers at this time.

**#Extra Hack:**

If you use gmail but also use other services like yahoo, hotmail, etc&#8230; You can simply import other services&#8217; contact list on Gmail!

Note that orkut can not import address book from other email servers but Gmail can! ðŸ˜‰

Have fun! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
