Just noticed a new Orkut Setting so that you can choose who can scrap to you! You can choose between&#8230;

  * <div>
      Friends Only
    </div>

  * <div>
      Friends of Friends <em>(recommended by DW)</em>
    </div>

  * <div>
      Everyone in your networks
    </div>

If you haven&#8217;t noticed it yet, look for a handy link in your scrapbook as shown in following screenshot&#8230;

Clicking on it will take you to the **<a href="http://www.orkut.com/PrivacySettings.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/PrivacySettings.aspx', 'Privacy Setting page']);" title="Click here to go to Orkut Privacy Settings Page"  target="_blank">Privacy Setting page</a>** of your Orkut account. Under setting** **<span><strong><em>&#8220;select who is allowed to view my content</em>&#8220;, </strong>modify <strong>write in scrapbook</strong> option from drop-down menu. Setting it to <strong>all of my friends</strong> will prevent rest of the people on orkut from scrapping you.</span>

I guess people (specially girls) concern about their privacy should choose either *Friends* or *Friends of friends*!

This will surely bring some relief to girls who are annoyed by sick people on Orkut! **Isn&#8217;t it???**
