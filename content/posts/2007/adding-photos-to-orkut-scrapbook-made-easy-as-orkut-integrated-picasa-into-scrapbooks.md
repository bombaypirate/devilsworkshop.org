Few days back orkut rolled out support for <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2007/08/13/orkut-updates-add-colors-images-videos-podcasts-audio-and-other-html-formatting-in-scraps/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Orkut Updates - Add Colors, Images, Videos, Podcasts, Audio and other HTML formatting in scraps!">adding colors, images, videos, podcasts, audio and other HTML formatting in scraps</a>! Although the methods to use these feature are somewhat simple most orkut users were looking for some user interface to do these chores!

Today I have noticed orkut added cool interface for adding photos to scrapbook! Look for &#8220;add photo&#8221; link in scrapbook. It is below the textbox for writing scraps. You can also check following screenshot.

Now once u click on the link you will get a wizard where **you will have three options&#8230;**

**1. Upload a picture from your computer to scrapbook ***(as you do while adding picture to your orkut album)***  
**

**2. Select any picture from your <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://picasaweb.google.com/', 'picasa web album']);" target="_blank">picasa web album</a>**

**3. Or you can directly give absolute web address of any picture over internet** (URL ending with *.jpg*, *.gif* or *.png*)
