Here comes another hack to download videos from video sharing sites like YouTube, Google Videos, etc! I come across it via a [anonymous comment][2] by a Devils Workshops&#8217; reader!

After giving you [Video Downloader Firefox extension][3] and [Kiss YouTube Hack][4] to do the same, this hack let you download videos from almost any site, although they have listed around 30 sites only!

Moreover it comes with a to make it further simple! Just drag-n-drop it to your browser&#8217;s toolbar and click on it to download videos you are watching! You don&#8217;t need to type anything like old KissYouTube hack!

**#How-To Use **

There are 2 ways!

First simply copy the link (URL) of the page with the video on it and paste it in a field provided at <a href="http://keepvid.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keepvid.com/', 'KeepVid&#8217;s Homepage']);" >KeepVid&#8217;s Homepage</a>!

The other way is for people who are addicted to videos like me ðŸ˜‰

  1. Just Drag above bookmarklet on browser toolbar! It will create an entry named **&#8220;Keep It&#8221;** on bookmark toolbar.
  2. Next time yo are visiting any video page from youtube, Google Video or any other service just click the **&#8220;Keep It&#8221;**.
  3. You will directly taken to the keepvid page with download link! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
