This new feature by Orkut wil remove need to use Google Talk, Gmail or [Thrid party scripts/tools][1] to get instant notification when someone send scraps to you!

Now whenever a new scrap appear on your scrapbook you will see a notification balloon in bottom-right side of your browser. (as shown in above screenshot)

In case if you do not like this feature you can turn-it off by going to <a href="http://www.orkut.com/NotificationsSettings.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/NotificationsSettings.aspx', 'Orkut&#8217;s notification settings']);" >Orkut&#8217;s notification settings</a> page!

Just uncheck box pointed in above screenshot!

If you have noticed then it seems orkut added complete new column named **notice** for this feature. We may expect more notice box specially next to new friend requests, new friend approval and other stuff!
