This is another GreaseMonkey Script from Devils Workshop for all orkuttians using firefox!

Recently I have seen lots of people on orkut keeping their scrapbook clean! Most of the time for privacy reason! This script will help them best as it is designed for them! I hope specially girls will find his useful!

<span style="font-weight: bold">Installation:</span>[<img class="wp-image-50400" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/10/orkutscrapdeleter.jpg" />][1]

  1. <span style="font-weight: bold"></span>This will require <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&id=199011&t=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&id=199011&t=1', 'Firefox']);" >Firefox</a> and <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/', 'GreaseMonkey']);" >GreaseMonkey</a>! (<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&id=199011&t=1greasemonkey/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&id=199011&t=1greasemonkey/', 'New to GreaseMonkey?']);" >New to GreaseMonkey?</a>)
  2. After that <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/8283.user.js" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/8283.user.js', 'click here']);" >click here</a> to install <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/8283.user.js" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/8283.user.js', 'Orkut Scrap Deleter Script']);" >Orkut Scrap Deleter Script</a>. A window will pop-up just hit install option!
  3. Script is installed but <span style="font-style: italic">READ NEXT FEW LINES BEFORE LEAVING THIS PAGE!</span>

By default, the script is <span style="font-weight: bold">ENABLED</span>! As you can see in screenshot, a check-mark will appear right before name of script! (You have to right-click on GreaseMonkey icon in lower-right corner of Firefox window.)

Now if you are in orkut then just open or refresh your scrapbook and it will start deleting scraps from oldest one first! The only way to STOP this is close the tab/window (i.e. scrapbook page) first and then again going to GreaseMonkey menu, DISABLE the script!

To **ENABLE/DISABLE **you have to just check/uncheck the script respectively from GreaseMonkey menu! No need to UNINSTALL the script!

I hope you will like this! Lemme know if you get some problems I know this is a bit trick script!
