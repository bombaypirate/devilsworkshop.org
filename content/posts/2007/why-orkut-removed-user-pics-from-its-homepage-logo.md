Just noticed orkut has changed its homepage drastically!

At first a funny thought came to my mind! I felt the logo might be temporarily changed for India. As <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2007/08/13/celebrate-60-years-of-independence-by-telling-orkut-what-do-u-think/" target="_blank">Orkut featured Indian logo</a> 2 days back I thought the original is lost somewhere so this temporary arrangement (see following screenshot)! Lolz!

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img class="wp-image-51356" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/orkut-homepage-logo-devils-workshop.JPG" alt="Orkut Homepage Logo" border="0" width="430" />
</div>

But I checked from various proxies and the logo is same everywhere! If you fail to remember, let me show you old orkut logo featuring 10 faces! (thanks Google Cache)

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/orkut-homepage-old-logo-devils-workshop.JPG" alt="Orkut Homepage Old Logo" border="0" />
</div>

It would not be surprise if these faces have been changed but orkut removed all faces! And I failed to figure out why???

So everybody out there&#8230; **Let us know if you can figure out some answer!** <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
