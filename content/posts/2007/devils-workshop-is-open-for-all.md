On **June 20, 2007** I have created a <a href="http://www.orkut.com/CommPollResults.aspx?cmm=19587001&pid=81698478&pct=1182308405" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/CommPollResults.aspx?cmm=19587001&pid=81698478&pct=1182308405', 'poll']);" >poll</a> in <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=19587001" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=19587001', 'DWs Orkut Community']);" >DWs Orkut Community</a> asking for whether anyone interested in joining DW. I got nice response but delay caused because of following reasons&#8230;.

  * I do not have formal revenue sharing program.
  * Copyright Problems??

Now Solution to these are&#8230;

  * The first payment will be made by DW once it gets into Top 100,000 sites on alexa. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=devilsworkshop.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=devilsworkshop.org', 'Its current rank']);" >Its current rank</a> is 400,000+ (on July 30, 2007 &#8211; at the time of writing this). Once we will be in Top 100,000 we will get into formal agreement for revenue sharing and other legal issues.
  * To avoid copyright violation, each new member will get a role of **Contributor &#8211;* Somebody who can write and manage their posts but not publish posts.**** (**<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities', 'More on Roles can be read from here']);" >More on Roles can be read from here</a>)*

Over the time loyal contributor will get promoted to higher privilege roles also may get bonus rewards.

About getting into Top 100,000&#8230; I think I can do it alone as writer within 10-12 months but together **we** can do it in 6 months or less than that! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
