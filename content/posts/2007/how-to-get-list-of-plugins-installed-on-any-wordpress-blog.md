If you are a wordpress blogger or just for some other reasons if you want to know which plugins are installed on your favorite wordpress blog then just go to <a href="http://www.pluginmeter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pluginmeter.com', 'Plugin Meter']);" target="_blank">Plugin Meter</a>!Just click on following link and you will see list of plugins installed on Devils Workshop! You may need to check following link in Internet Explorer.

<a href="http://www.pluginmeter.com/blogs/www.devilsworkshop.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pluginmeter.com/blogs/www.devilsworkshop.org', 'http://www.pluginmeter.com/blogs/www.devilsworkshop.org']);" target="_blank">http://www.pluginmeter.com/blogs/<strong>www.devilsworkshop.org</strong></a>

You can change **bold** part in above URL with any wordpress blog address to see its plugin list.

This newly launched service is still in beta. Its directory index have **14371 **WordPress blogs covering stats about **3239** plugins. You will be lucky if the blog you are looking for is already indexed. Which is the case with almost all famous blogs. Even if the blog is not in the list you can submit its URL to get it indexed soon!

Additionally what I like is list of **Top 20** plugins worldwide, which is displayed on its homepage! As the stats are real time, you can consider plugin meter as a good place to find really top plugins.

**Problems in ****Beta&#8230;**

  * You may find few pages messed too much in Firefox. No-No don&#8217;t blame firefox as its responsibility of web-designer to insure site works properly in different browsers. Atleast major browsers like Firefox, IE, Safari & Opera.
  * I also noticed it dumps just list of all plugins found on blog. I guess it would be better if atleast they differentiate between active and inactive plugins.
  * Also there are small tweaks can be performed in user interface.

**Finally&#8230;**  
I wish I could come across a service like this when I was new to wordpress. I still remember testing really bad plugins in the beginning which wasted my lots of time as well as efforts!
