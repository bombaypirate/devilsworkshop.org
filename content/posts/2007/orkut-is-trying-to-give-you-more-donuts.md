Few weeks back we had discussion &#8211; [Why Orkut removed user pics from its homepage Logo?][2]

We received nice response from our readers and today official word about this from Orkut! And reasoning is surpisingly simple&#8230;

User pics on orkut homepage used to take some time to load. While this is only something noticed by dial-up users only nevertheless each login request put more and more load on the orkut server. That means more ***&#8220;no donut for you***&#8221; error.

I guess its clear to everyone now how much Orkut care for giving you donuts, so don&#8217;t shout on seeing ***&#8220;no donut for you***&#8221; error message! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
