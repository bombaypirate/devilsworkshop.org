Long time back me n Vijay tried to make a greasemonkey script which will show orkut in local time. That means if it worked successfully u could see scraps, community posts in local time n not in PST Timezone which orkut <s>is</s> was following! Well such script was there on <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4101" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4101', 'userscripts.org']);" >userscripts.org</a> but stopped working after orkuts last big code change around August 2007.

So am I giving u that script today? Well if u think so then u have not noticed that orkut has made this change alongwith <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/action-roll-orkut-videos.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/action-roll-orkut-videos.html', 'new video integration']);" >new video integration</a> in orkut! So u can see scraps, community posts all in ur time! Now u will get to know ur friends birthday at midnight!

This is already done for everyone. If u r accidentally or purposefully changed ur country on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/EditGeneral.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/EditGeneral.aspx', 'orkuts settings']);" >orkuts settings</a> page, then all u need to do select ur right country!

Well I don&#8217;t think this will make any difference to most of the people as punctuality is rare quality now-a-dayz!

Happy Orkutting!
