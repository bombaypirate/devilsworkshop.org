<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Before reading ahead&#8230;</span>  
please note that this is not something which can burst traffic to your site/blog overnight! At Devils Workshop, we are against of all kind of spamming but we value your hard-work and thus would like you to help you to get maximum out of it! Thus lazy people and spammers quit here itself!

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Now for hard-workers&#8230;<br /> </span>Well I have lots of tricks for you guys and will post them here time to time. Lets start now without wasting your more time!<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic"><br /> </span><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 130%"><br /> <span style="font-weight: bold">While naming your files or blog posts titles&#8230;</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold"></span>

First lets talk about optimal filenames:

  * Never use filenames like ch1, ch2, &#8230; or 1, 2, 3, etc&#8230;
  * If you want hierarchy go for ch1-Intro, ch2-Types, etc&#8230;
  * Try to use longer filenames with as much keyword as possible.
  * If file is static HTML file then always make use of title tag : <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new"><title></span> also try to use title upto 100 characters.
  * Use underscore (<span style="font-weight: bold">_</span>) instead of space to separate multiword filenames 
      * e.g. use &#8220;rahul_bansal&#8221; instead of &#8220;rahul bansal&#8221;

<span style="font-weight: bold">Now its Blog Posts Titles:<br /> </span>

  * Make sure all keywords comes earlier!
  * Try to minimize use of junk words like <span style="font-style: italic">of, are, hurry, surprise, important, read-this, etc </span><span>atleast in first 30-40 characters.</span><span style="font-style: italic"><br /> </span>
  * <span style="font-weight: bold">Enable Post Pages</span> which give each of your posts their own unique web page, in addition to appearing on your blog&#8217;s front page. (For Blogspot Blogger, Go to <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Settings >> Archiving >> Enable Post Pages </span>and select<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic"> &#8220;YES&#8221;</span>)
  * Try to use maximum available length of blog post titles (normally upto 100 characters)

<span style="font-weight: bold">Reasoning:<br /> </span>

  * <span>First lemme me remind you what makes a URL (i.e. Uniform Resource Locater) with a simplest example!</span>

<blockquote style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold; color: #660000">
  <p>
    URL = <protocol e.g. HTTP> + <site name> + < optional path> + <filename>
  </p>
</blockquote>

  * <span>Also remember title of a page is displayed in your browsers top most strip (it is often concatenated with browser name itself, but don&#8217;t bother about this browser name part)</span>

<span>With these two terms we will dissect now blog post titles </span><span>and filenames together!</span><span style="font-weight: bold"><br /> </span>

  * Blog post title forms Title of post pages as well as URL!
  * If post pages are enabled, every blog post gets converted to static HTML page with a file name which makes is part of URL!
  * Post pages are nothing but <span style="font-weight: bold">files</span> dynamically created so again convention for file names and post page title overlaps! <span style="font-style: italic">(thats why covering both in same post here ðŸ˜‰</span>
  * Thats why I insisted similar things like keeping file names and blog post titles longer as much as possible!
  * Unfortunately for files their name and title tag need to be chosen separately!
  * For blogs post tiles goes in both places! But only first 30-40 characters of post title gets converted to filename i.e. name of post page!
  * Thats why be wise to use maximum keyword as early as possible in post title!
  * Always remember never exceed title more than 100 (while 150 is allowed). Search engine may treat you spam if they discover titles are toooooooo lengthy!

<span style="font-weight: bold">How it benefits:<br /> </span>First lets look at an example : A user hits <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=Using+Orkut+Mobile" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.in/search?q=Using+Orkut+Mobile', 'Google with query &#8211; Using Orkut Mobile']);" >Google with query &#8211; Using Orkut Mobile</a>

<span>The output is highlighted in following screenshot <span style="font-style: italic">(click on it too enlarge)</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Point to be noted:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">Whenever a user hit a query highest weight is given to URL and blog post titles (ofcourse within same pagerank group)</span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold">Thats why all this trouble for post titles and file names! It may appear tedious but soon you will be habitual with it! Got it! ðŸ˜‰</span>

Some notes&#8230; (You can skip this if I already bored you enough!)  
<span style="font-weight: bold">PS1: </span>This small looking post took my 3-4 hours! There are countless search engine optimization exist which applies to Google and other search engine also (I know only few&#8230; may be around 50) So feedback is necessary if you guys want me too spend more time writing on this issue!

<span style="font-weight: bold">PS2:</span> This is first time I am writing on topic &#8211; SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This field is generally considered as webmasters arena but I see no reason for non-technical people to loose valuable information it carry! Thats why I tried to write keeping in mind naive user! If you think this could be written it better terms please spare some time for your valuable suggestions (via comments preferably)

<span style="font-weight: bold">PS3:</span> is better than XBOX 360! ðŸ˜›
