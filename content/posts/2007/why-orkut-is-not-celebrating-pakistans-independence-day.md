Just few hours back I have posted how <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2007/08/13/celebrate-60-years-of-independence-by-telling-orkut-what-do-u-think/" target="_blank">Orkut is celebrating Indias 60 Years of Independence</a>!  
Then I received comment from <a href="http://www.freakitude.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freakitude.com/', 'Lovedeep']);" target="_blank">Lovedeep</a> on that post saying Orkut Logo featuring Indian tricolor looking great!

And I wondered how Orkut Logo is featured in Pakistan as Pakistan also completing 60 Years of Independence day on **14<sup>th</sup> August, 2007.**

So I decided to use a proxy for Pakistan &#8211; <a href="http://www.orkut.pk/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.pk/', 'www.orkut.pk']);" target="_blank">www.orkut.pk</a> and shocked to see normal orkut logo!

Curiously I contacted Orkut Team asking,

> wat about pakistan???  
> they r also having their 60th independence day!

and they replied with this&#8230;.

> Thank you for your feedback. We would love to hear from you via email too! orkut-users@google.com

Why this biasness??? Is this Independence Day celebration is professional move from orkut without any real spirit? Even if the answer is yes, isn&#8217;t Pakistan matters for orkut atleast professionally??

Anybody out there can answer this???
