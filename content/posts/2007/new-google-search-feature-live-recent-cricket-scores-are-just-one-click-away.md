Just type <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=cricket" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.in/search?q=cricket', 'cricket']);" title="Google Search Result for [Cricket]" target="_blank"><strong>cricket</strong></a> in a Google search box and you&#8217;ll see a brief score of all the current cricket matches. A single click will also give you access to a detailed cricket score card. *(see following screenshot&#8230;)*

<img class="wp-image-52155" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/09/googlesearchfeature-livecricketscoresarejustone-clickaway.jpg" alt="Google Search Feature - Live Cricket Scores are just One-Click Away!" height="240" width="430" />

If you&#8217;re a diehard India fan, then type **<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cricket+India" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?q=cricket+India', 'cricket india']);" title="Google Search Result for [Cricket India]">cricket india</a>** or **<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cricket+score+India+England" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?q=cricket+score+India+England', 'cricket score India England']);" title="Google Search Result for [Cricket Score India England]">cricket score India England</a>** to get results for Indian matches. Of course, feel free to replace India with the country of your choice for country-specific results.

If there is not any live match going on the search will return most recent matchs&#8217; scorecard link!

Also one thing <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/get-your-cricket-scores-here.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/get-your-cricket-scores-here.html', 'Googlers']);" >Googlers</a> forgot to mention on their blog is, the results are simultaneously available from three sources Cricinfo, Cricbuzz & Willow. So look at green un-clickable link in result (in above screenshot its ***m6.willow.tv***) and if its not the place where you enjoy cricket then look for clickble blue links just below it for alternate resources (in above screenshot its ***Cricinfo, Cricbuzz & Willow***).

Thats it! For time being enjoi Twenty-20 worldcup! And in a break **let us know where you enjoyit most, i.e. Cricinfo, Cricbuzz, Willow OR some other site?**
