Yes! From 12 to 25, Orkut silently doubled album storage! So all orkuteers can upload more photos now! Can&#8217;t believe it??? Check out the proof below&#8230;

I am still wondering when Picasa will integrate with Orkut! So that [we can have more storage][1]!

Meantime keep uploading you memories! But don&#8217;t forget the limit of 25!

By the way how much photos you like to upload on orkut given unlimited storage?
