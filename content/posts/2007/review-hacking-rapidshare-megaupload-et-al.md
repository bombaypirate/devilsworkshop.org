Guys, long time back I had posted about [Rapidshare and Megaupload Hacking][1].  
That hack did not work for long but the Chitz from whose forum I gotta knew about that hack started a dedicated blog on this issue!

Considering frequency of his posts I can only say God Bless Rapidshare, Megashare and companies like them! What a good news for downloaders!

<a href="http://chitzs.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chitzs.blogspot.com/', 'Click here']);" style="font-weight: bold">Click here</a><span style="font-weight: bold"> to visit his blog!</span>

P.S. Chitzs is new to blogsphere so freely post comment if u like some of his work!

Thank U!
