It has been pleasure being here but with your continuous support Devils Workshop has grown to look out for a better home over the time!

Actually moving to WordPress blogging systems decision was taken few months back but the delay caused first by self-hosting decision and then finding a .COM domain. (I wish I could get devilsworkshop.com)  
We also once thought about changing name of this blog and conducted a <a href="http://www.orkut.com/CommPollVote.aspx?cmm=19587001&pct=1179566550&pid=2098273068" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/CommPollVote.aspx?cmm=19587001&pct=1179566550&pid=2098273068', 'poll on orkut']);" >poll on orkut</a> too! The result till date is 100% in favor of Devils Workshop current name!

As of now, I can say that WordPress v/s Blogspot can be compared at par with Firefox v/s Internet Explorer ðŸ˜€  
I will write more about wordpress later on. It has thousands of plugins (like extensions in Firefox) and I am tired right now to write about them!
