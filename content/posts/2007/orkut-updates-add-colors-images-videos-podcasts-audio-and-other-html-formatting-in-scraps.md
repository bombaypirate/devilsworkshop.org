This is one of the most searched orkut hack as I remember! My posts &#8211; <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/08/14/orkut-sending-images-in-scraps/" target="_blank">Sending Images in Scraps</a> & <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/08/14/orkut-put-running-text-in-scrap/" target="_blank">Put Running Text In Scrap</a> &#8211; on this topics still receive hits from search engines!

So why I am writing today about outdated posts?? Or are these hacks working again?

Yes, these hacks are officially working so lets call them features! And they are so many that we can enlist them as follows&#8230;

  * **Adding images**  
    Copy and paste urls ending in .jpg, .gif, .png or .bmp and the image will appear in the scrap.  
    for example, http://example.com/example.jpg

  * **Adding videos from YouTube and Google Video**  
    Copy and paste the url and the video will appear in the scrap.  
    for example, http://youtube.com/watch?v=videoid

  * **Adding podcast/audio**  
    Copy and paste the url of an audio file and an audio player will appear in the scrap.  
    for example, http://example.com/example.mp3

  * **Adding html-embeddable objects**  
    Create or upload your content at sites such as photobucket.com, imageshack.com, rockyou.com or slide.com. Copy and paste the html embed code to share it with your friends.

Here is screenshot of my scrapbook&#8230; (click on it to enlarge)

<div style="text-align: center">
  <a title="Orkut scrapbook showing new features - Devils Workshop" href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/orkut-scrapbook-new-features-devils-workshop.JPG" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-53181" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/orkut-scrapbook-new-features-devils-workshop.JPG" border="0" alt="Orkut scrapbook showing new features - Devils Workshop" width="420" /></a>
</div>

**There is one catch to this new feature!**

No, no&#8230; You don&#8217;t need to pay anything! ðŸ˜‰

You can use these smart features while sending scraps to your friends!

Also as all of above contains atleast one URL, that means you have to encounter image verification which is kinda annoying! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**Finally&#8230;** Dont get panic if this feature is not working for you as this feature is added to new profiles first! So if you are senior citizen on orkut (like me) you may have to wait for few days before you will be able to use this cool feature! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**#Updates: How to know these features are available to you&#8230;**

Check old scrapbook&#8230;
