Here is an excerpt: 

> Danny Sullivan made a post today at <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060309-094646" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060309-094646', 'Search Engine Watch']);" target="_blank">Search Engine Watch</a> quoting a USA Today piece on the alarming amount of Al-Qaeda fan groups in Google&#8217;s Orkut. Anytime one talks about Orkut the Brazilian phenomina is discussed which centers around why is Orkut so popular in Brazil?
> 
> Danny posted on Search Engine Watch after Google Analyst Day : *My favorite part is probably the explanation of why Orkut only seems to be taking off in Brazil. Brazilians are just very community-oriented. What, all those crazy US kids jumping into MySpace like my niece don&#8217;t have a sense of community?*
