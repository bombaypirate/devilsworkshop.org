<img class="wp-image-52890" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/facebook-logo-devils-workshop.gif" alt="Facebook Logo" align="right" border="0" />If you are new on facebook and having problem with its security <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha', 'captcha']);" target="_blank">captcha</a> i.e. image verification!

In simple words if you noticed ***words in the box as images*** while poking, messaging, or sending friend requests this is time to get rid off all this permanently as facebook now supports international phone numbers for verification.

You can verify your account by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/confirmphone.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/confirmphone.php', 'confirming your mobile phone']);" target="_blank">confirming your mobile phone</a> number!

Just follow the above link and all you will need to do is selecting your country from drop-down menu and typing your mobile number! Just note don&#8217;t add country code or any of the special character like ***&#8216;-&#8216;*** (hypen) to your number.

After this press confirm and you will be redirected to next page as well you will get a SMS on your mobile! In my case SMS took around 1 minute after clicking confirm so just wait for few minutes before pressing back button of your browser.

Once you get SMS put it on the screen waiting for you and you will be done!

Thats so simple!!! So don&#8217;t go away from facebook for its annoying image verification on each move! ðŸ˜‰
