While there are few extensions already out there on similar lines what makes this kool is its easy interface!

Can you imagine it is so easy that you don&#8217;t need any external application like Ã‚ÂµTorrent or bittorrent??

Just click on a torrent link and the downloading will start immediately.

**#Features**

  * **Nice Integration:** This extension adds a separate ***Torrent*** tab to the Firefox&#8217;s built-in download manager. (see screenshot)

  * **Options:** Provides option for selecting port nos, download/upload limit, location to save files, security & encryption configuration, etc! you can configure parameters like no. of connection, port no. to accept incoming connection, proxy settings, default folder, download/upload limit, etc! Everything like a standalone torrent client!

  * **Need More Info**: If you like to see more info like no. of peers you are downloading from just click on more info link!</p>

**In their own words&#8230;**

> <p class="mb10">
>   The FireTorrent extension strives to offer the most user-friendly BitTorrent experience. We&#8217;ve integrated the torrents manager as a separate tab in your browser&#8217;s download manager, and torrents can be downloaded from any website with a single click.

> This results in a great user experience and should be attractive to both people that are new to downloading torrents and advanced users.

**#Quick FAQ:**

**1.** Nothing happened when I clicked the above link?

**Ans:** The extension is hosted on third party site. So I am sure you can see a ***Edit-Options*** stripe on top-side of this page! Just press ***Edit-Options***, Click ***Allow*** and finally click above installation link again!

**#User Question (by Khan)**

**1.** In download window it doesnt show any file downloading!

**Ans:** Make sure you are at **torrent tab** in Firefoxs&#8217; download manager (see above screenshot 1)  
**#Bonus:** Just check out this <a href="http://start.wyzo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://start.wyzo.com/', 'start page']);" target="_blank">start page</a> from wyzo guys (developrers of above extension). It lets you search 33 engines with minimal effort. Just select your category (web, torrents, images, video, news, blogs or shopping) and you&#8217;ll find the top search engines in the dropdown menu. Conveniently, the most popular search engine is automatically selected for each category. May be its time to change your homepage! ðŸ˜‰

**So is this end of debate over superiority of different Torrent clients?**
