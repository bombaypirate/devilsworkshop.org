Last week we started discussion &#8211; <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2007/08/17/why-orkut-removed-user-pics-from-its-homepage-logo/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Why Orkut removed user pics from its homepage Logo!">Why Orkut removed user pics from its homepage Logo???</a>

It seems Orkut heard about our conversation (i know its stupid 2 imagine&#8230; lolz) and confirmed that they are <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2007/08/coming-soon-new-look.html#links" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2007/08/coming-soon-new-look.html#links', 'coming with a new look']);" >coming with a new look</a>! This turn out <a href="http://www.geeneeyes.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.geeneeyes.blogspot.com/', 'Pramod Ghuge']);" rel="external nofollow">Pramod Ghuge</a> prediction to be true as he said in his [comment][1] on above [discussion,][2]

> <div class="content">
>   Orkut is gearing up for a new look and great new features<br /> it is not a coincidence that new logo was unveiled at the same time that most users can send rich content scraps (images, flash, html)so definitely Orkut want to make the public feel like its newer and better!

Good guess Pramod! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Well we have more! Although Orkut said the new look will take time to reach all users we managed to capture few screenshots of one such feature. The feature will allow you to upload pics directly to the orkut scrapbook!

Look for &#8220;add photo&#8221; link in scrapbook. It is below the textbox for writing scraps. You can also check following screenshot.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/add-photo-to-scrapbook-devils-workshop.JPG" target="_blank" title="Add Photo to Scrapbook"><img class="wp-image-51352" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/add-photo-to-scrapbook-devils-workshop.JPG" alt="Add Photo to Scrapbook" border="0" width="420" /></a>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
</div>

Now once u click on the link you will get a wizard as shown in following screenshot&#8230; *(click on image to enlarge it)*

<div style="text-align: center">
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/upload-a-picture-on-orkut-devils-workshop.JPG" target="_blank" title="Upload a picture on orkut"><img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/upload-a-picture-on-orkut-devils-workshop.JPG" alt="Upload a picture on orkut" border="0" width="420" /></a>
</div>

No we have not yet got new looks of orkut!

If you have noticed in above screenshot there is only ***cancel*** button on screen which is also not working yet! Forget about ***OK*** or ***Upload*** button!

By the way [you can still send images, videos and other content in scrapbook][3]!

Lets see whats coming&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
