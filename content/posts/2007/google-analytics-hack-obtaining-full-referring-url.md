It&#8217;s so frustrating that you can&#8217;t usually find which forum thread is linking to your website, because under the referring site report, cross segment performance, content report, it truncates the URL at the end of the filename, so you end up with items like:

/forums/showthread.php  
/forums/viewtopic.php  
etc.

Reuben Yau managed to find a way to use the urchinTracker function to place the exact referring URL into the top content report. <a href="http://www.reubenyau.com/google-analytics-hack-obtaining-full-referring-url/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reubenyau.com/google-analytics-hack-obtaining-full-referring-url/', 'Click here']);" style="font-weight: bold;">Click here</a> to know how he did that!
