There is simple way to overcome this problem by buying some storage. As Googles Official Blog, plan starts at $20/year for 6GB (yes, $5 cheaper than before), with larger plans ranging up to 250GB. *(<a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/PurchaseStorage" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/accounts/PurchaseStorage', 'Click here to see all plans']);" target="_blank">Click here to see all plans</a>)*

Also you can <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageStorage" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageStorage', 'check current space usage']);" target="_blank">check current space usage</a> across all Google Services for your Google Account at one place!

Whats surprising me is the exclusion of service like **Google Pages** which is quite popular among not-so-geek users and hosting many small websites! Strangely Google have storage upgradation plans for services having **1GB (Picasa)** and **2.8GB (Gmail)** but no donuts for **100MB** service which is **Google Pages!** :O
