Yep. Soon Google crawlers will be indexing orkut profiles and everyone on orkut will be googlable. In simple terms you can use google search to find your friends&#8217; orkut profile and your friends can do same to find you!

Although there is no official post regarding this on any Google or Orkut official blog, a <a href="http://www.orkut.com/PrivacySettings.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/PrivacySettings.aspx', 'new privacy setting']);" >new privacy setting</a> &#8211; "**orkut in google search results**", indicates just this.

By default this setting is configured to show your orkut information in search results! That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t need to do anything to appear in google search.

Those who are concern about privacy can choose "**hide information" **option. There is no fine grained control like facebook provides. So better opt for hiding if you have doubt on how this feature will be used (or abused).

Three months back [facebook opened their user database for search engines][2] and considering facebooks that move this should not surprise anyone.

Also **can orkut do this as sensibly as facebook did? **
