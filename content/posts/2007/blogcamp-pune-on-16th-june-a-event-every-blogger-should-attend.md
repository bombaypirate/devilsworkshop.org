Yes, this weekend Devil gotta some great plans!

Being a blogger over a year I think its time to meet other animals of same species. Like a human a blogger have some social needs and there can not be a better place than BlogCamp!

I was aware of events like this from long time but this Saturday I think I can make it! Well you might be thinking what is this all about? In their own words&#8230;.

> **BlogCampPune is a FREE unconference** focusing exclusively on blogging, organized by bloggers for bloggers. Its built upon the principles of the famous <span class="WikiLink">BarCamp</span> (ad-hoc unconference) focussed on sharing, learning and new ideas. This is going to be an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction between attendees. Any blogger who wants to contribute is welcome and invited to join.**&#8230;**

Also if you are bugged by history, read its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp', 'wiki on wikipedia']);" target="_blank">wiki on wikipedia</a> which dscribes BarCamp as,

> BarCamp is an international network of unconferences open, participatory workshop-events, whose content is provided by participants focusing on early-stage web applications, and related open source technologies and social protocols. The name is a playful allusion to its origins, with reference to the hacker slang term, foobar: BarCamp arose as a spin-off from Foo Camp, an annual invitation-only unconference hosted by open source publishing luminary, Tim O&#8217;Reilly.

The event is free which includes free lunch, snaks and T-shirt (thats too option to specify your T-shirt size in advance)&#8230; Lolz ðŸ˜€
