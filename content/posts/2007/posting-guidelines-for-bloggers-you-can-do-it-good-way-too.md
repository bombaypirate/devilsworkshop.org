<span style="color: #9f0a0a;"><strong>#Important:</strong></span><span style="color: #9f0a0a;"> </span>

<span style="color: #9f0a0a;">All Devils Workshop contributors <strong>must</strong> follow as well as contribute to these guidelines so as to maintain quality of posts!</span>

<span style="color: #9f0a0a;">This will be updated from time-to-time as-per-demand! You are free to suggest any editing to this any time!</span>

**<span style="color: #9f0a0a;">Thank You,</span>**

**<span style="color: #9f0a0a;">-DW Admin</span>**

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"><strong>#Guidelines</strong></span></p> 

**1. Provide as much as screenshot/videos/example/links you can!**  
Do u know we have **160GB+** free space on our server! Great Na!!! :-)So never hesitate to upload anything you need to make your post more readable!

***Why&#8230;???***

  * **Screenshots** &#8211; A picture is worth 1000 words
  * **Videos** &#8211; People love Demos
  * **Examples** &#8211; They bridge communication gap between you and your audience!
  * **Links** &#8211; When all above fails (and you sound alien to people) links can be your final attempt to save your ass (from being kicked for wasting peoples time)!

**2. We hate stealing!**

So always cite resources you are using clearly in your posts!  
Also using a resource doesnt mean copying it **as-it-is**! Duplication of content may lead a contributor to loose his membership with DW!

***Gurr.. why so strict about this??***  
Google and other search engine are able to detect duplicate content and also can recognise which one is original! So that may lead to blacklisting of DW!

**3. We hate spamming!**

Never use (or better say abuse) your posts with irrelevant keywords just for better search engine ranking!

Well what matters more to us are our **human visitors**! And any kinda spamming will surely annoy them!

**4. Use optimal formatting! (<<IMP)  
**

Dont paint each line of your post in different color. **Remember we are here to write and not to paint**!

Also a plain-text post is pain to read. So use formatting wisely!

Format as per demand! Here are some example of common demands&#8230;.

  * Headings/subheading can go in bold.
  * Use ***code tag*** for Source Codes/ error messages/etc machine related stuff.
  * Write commands in bold/italics.
  * Always hyperlink wherever possible!

***Key to remember&#8230;***

  * **Formatting is not coloring! **In fact avoid coloring any part unless it begs you to color itself!
  * **Formatting is to enhance readability!**

**5. Summary Writing**

This is not essential for small posts! But if you are writing a bigger post covering may things its good to end that with abstract/summary saying&#8230;

  * Links
  * Summary
  * Related Links (this is used at the end of this post)
  * Resources
  * References
  * Credits

**Finally,** Do u know this post can be made **10 times better** with very little change in content! So lets play a game of improving this to learn some blogging tips on the way! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
