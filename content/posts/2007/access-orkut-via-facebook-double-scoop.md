If you are on Facebook and Orkut at the same time, this one Facebook application is for you! It is developed by <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/%7Ejeetu/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/%7Ejeetu/', 'Jeetu Mirchandani']);" >Jeetu Mirchandani</a> (former IIT Bombay Student, working for Amazon, India) so that you can read scraps via Orkut!

Through this application you can view Orkut users profiles, photos, scrapbook, videos & fans with this! So this can be used as limited proxy in places where Orkut is banned but Facebook is not. This is the situation with most Asian countries including India where Facebook is yet to catch up with popularity of Orkut!

**#Installation on Facebook**

  1. Login to your Facebook account.
  2. Click here to go to application page. You will be greeted with a page like below. Click on Add Application Link. <img class="wp-image-51262" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/10/orkutapplicationforfacebook-devilsworkshop.jpg" alt="Orkut Application for Facebook - Devils Workshop" height="274" width="430" />
  3. It will ask for confirmation like other Facebook application. Also it will ask for inviting your friends which is optional and can be skipped!
  4. Next Put your Orkut profile URL in field shown below&#8230;<img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/10/orkutprofilelink-devilsworkshop.gif" alt="Orkut Profile Link - Devils Workshop" height="199" width="430" />
  5. Thats it. You will end up on a page which will look like your Orkut Profile page<img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/10/myorkutprofileonfacebook-devilsworkshop.jpg" alt="My Orkut Profile On Facebook - Devils Workshop" height="478" width="430" />

This application does not require your Orkut login ID & password, but I personally feel it should take it to give more feature!

As of now claimed to be working feature &#8211; **Writing Scrap** is not working. Surprisingly big blogger like <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/10/access-orkut-from-facebook-leave-scraps.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/10/access-orkut-from-facebook-leave-scraps.html', 'Amit Agrawal']);" target="_blank">Amit Agrawal</a> did not bother to test it before writing about it!

I feel the feature is implemented using fake Orkut account to send scraps on your behalf. As this applications user base grew this feature is now getting blocked by Orkut CATCHPA.

Anyway its nice start by Jeetu and another option for you to access Orkut! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
