  </span><br /> Lets intercept the truth (as usual)!<br /> First Orkut is by Google so its bound to be free! (As per Google&#8217;s reputation and history)<br /> And most important, there is no TIM BUISKI in orkut team!<span><span style="font-size: 85%"><span style="font-size: 100%"> </span></span></span>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut', 'Read this wikipedia page']);" >Read this wikipedia page</a>)
</p>

<p>
  Also following FAQ is taken from an Orkut Help page&#8230;
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 85%"><strong> Are you planning to charge orkut users? </strong><br /> </span>
  </p>
  
  <div class="i">
    <span style="font-size: 85%"> orkut is a free service, and there are currently no plans to charge for orkut.If you receive messages or emails about orkut becoming a paid service, please disregard them; they&#8217;re a hoax. Major changes to orkut are always posted on the &#8220;News&#8221; section of orkut.com, so if you&#8217;re ever in doubt about the authenticity of an email you receive, please refer to the News section for the real scoop.</p> 
    
    <p>
      We hope you&#8217;ll continue to use orkut to stay connected to old friends and new &#8212; for free!
