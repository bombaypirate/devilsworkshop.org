A simple modification to URL and all private videos becomes publicly available! Thats a new hack for MySpace users found by <a href="http://grownupgeek.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://grownupgeek.com/', 'GrownUpGeek']);" target="_blank">GrownUpGeek</a>!

Although MySpace is not a popular video-sharing site (compare to photo uploaded on it, nevertheless this will surely compromise a MySpace users privacy. Following is trick and screenshot from <a href="http://grownupgeek.com/myspace-private-profile-video" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://grownupgeek.com/myspace-private-profile-video', 'GrownUpGeek&#8217;s post']);" target="_blank">GrownUpGeek&#8217;s post</a>&#8230;

Copy following URL as it is and insert the ***Myspace friendID*** at the end in place of the **XXXXX**

`http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.showvids&friendid=XXXXXXX`

Check out following screenshot for an example URL!

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img class="wp-image-57426" src="http://grownupgeek.com/images/fid.jpg" border="0" height="47" width="420" />
</div>

So if you have some really personal videos its time to move them to another site like YouTube or delete them at all!
