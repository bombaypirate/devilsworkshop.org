Yes, showing Adsense Ads after each blog post was never simple like this! As this is one of the most awaited feature which Google integrated into Blogger! Also this means blogger won&#8217;t be needing our one of the most famous hack to <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2007/04/06/blogger-adsense-hack-show-ads-after-each-post-to-earn-more-from-your-blogger-beta-blog/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Blogger + Adsense Hack: Show ads after each post to earn more from your blogger beta blog!">Show ads after each post to earn more from your blogger beta blog!</a>

Here is 3-step Guide to do it for your blogger blog&#8230;

  1. Log into your Blogger account at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blogger.com/', 'http://www.blogger.com']);" >http://www.blogger.com</a> .
  2. Visit your blog&#8217;s **Template** tab and click on the **Page Elements** link. *(Click on image to enlarge)*[<img class="wp-image-54527" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/blogger_template_devils_workshop.PNG" alt="Blogger_Template" border="0" width="350" />][1]
  3. Click **Edit** in the **Blog Posts** section.
  4. Check the box next to **Show Ads Between Posts**. You can then select how often you&#8217;d like your ads to appear, such as once after every post or once after every other post. *(Click on image to enlarge)*[<img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2007/08/blogger_inline_adsense_devils_workshop.PNG" alt="Blogger_Inline_Adsense" border="0" width="350" />][2]
  5. Customize the ads and click on **Save Changes** when you&#8217;re done.

Can it be made further simple??

One thing I feel Google should provide is ability to choose where to insert ads! I mean **before posts,** **after posts **or **after few lines/paragraphs! **

Ever more fine grain control can be given to blogger by giving ability to insert adsense codes any where between the posts! Say integrating some widget in post editor!

Well there is always room to do it better! **What do you say? **<img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
