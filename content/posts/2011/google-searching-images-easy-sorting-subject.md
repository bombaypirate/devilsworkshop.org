If you search for a racing car image on Google search, you get some relevant images. The images are shown by relevancy based on the search query. This means if we are looking for an image of a particular brand, we need to enter the brand name in the search query.

Google has made searching for images a lot more easy by sorting them by subject.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Google_image_search_sort_subject" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/Google_image_search_sort_subject_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Google_image_search_sort_subject" width="552" height="356" />][1]

As you can see in the image above, a new option shows up that allows sorting images displayed by relevant and subject. The subjects are displayed separately as different links that allows further exploration.

Next time you are looking for images online with Google search, try out “sort by subject”.

Here is a video by Google, demonstrating the advantages of using “sort by subject”.
