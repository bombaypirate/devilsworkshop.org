These services most times requires you to sign up/register with an email account. While taking a look at such services, I am often a little sceptical of sharing my primary email id. Hence, I end up creating email ids I used as dumps for signing up.

**TrashMail** allows us to create a temporary email ID and have the emails sent to the temporary account, forwarded to your permanent email id.

  * As you can see in the image above, TrashMail allows creating customized temporary email ids.
  * Just enter your real email address so you can receive all the emails sent to your temporary email id.
  * A good feature I liked about this site, is I can limit the number of forwards. This works great if you are spammed by some service which has temporary email id.
  * Finally I could tweak the Life Span of the disposable account from 1 day to 1 month.

This will help down cut spamming your email address. If you have a Hotmail account as your primary account then you can also try <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/create-disposable-email-ids-hotmail/" target="_blank">creating alias accounts feature</a>. Try out TrashMail and do drop in your comments with your views on junk e-mail and ways to combat it.
