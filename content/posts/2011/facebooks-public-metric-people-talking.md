They have launched a new feature called &#8220;People Talking About This&#8221; which is a new count of users interacting with that page. This new count is public and is visible to every one visiting that page. That mean&#8217;s it&#8217;s not only for admins unlike post impressions.

This &#8220;People Talking About This&#8221; will measure the user interaction on a page. This user interaction includes Likes on posts, Wall post written by a member, sharing content, RSVP to page&#8217;s events, mentioning page&#8217;s name somewhere on Facebook, tagging Page in a photo, and Check-ins in case the page  is of some place.

This is a good feature and will motivate page owners and admins to keep the page updated with good and quality content in order to keep users active. Also this &#8220;People Talking About This&#8221; matters a lot as this is a public metric i.e. visible to everyone visiting that page.
