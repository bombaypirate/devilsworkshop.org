Google+ has a bit of a mini-crises. It is mainly created by its invite only strategy for Google+, which did [raise a lot of initial interest][1] but with time, people tend to lose interest. After all Google+ wants to be a great product and not just a trend.

Surely, Google+ needed a big push to get more people signing up and they have done this with an amazing advertisement, which no one who uses Google search will miss.

[<img class="wp-image-51292" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/09/Google_Plus_advt_on_search_thumb.png" alt="Google_Plus_advt_on_search" width="570" height="335" border="0" />][2]

Basically, every time someone visits the Google homepage, they will be shown a big arrow pointing towards signing up for a Google + account (as seen in the image above).

Facebook might have 600 million regular users but Google search page has probably around a billion visitors atleast if not more. That means this could suddenly see millions joining Google+, obviously increasing its popularity.

## Google+ vs Facebook: Real Fight Begins

Google Plus has received a lot of publicity, it got a lot of praise but it was mainly a by invitation only product. We could compare privacy features and layouts between the two products but now since Google+ is an open to all product, the real fight with Facebook will begin.

By the way Facebook will have its F8 conference tomorrow – it will surely announce something new and exciting. We will have to wait and watch.

Will Google+ manage to end the dominance of Facebook? Do drop in your views and comments.
