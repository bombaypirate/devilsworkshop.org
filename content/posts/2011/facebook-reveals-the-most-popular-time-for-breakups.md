Have you ever given a thought on what all Facebook can tell you ? Well, the number of time a person stays online, the way he shares his information tells a lot about the user. Just for instance have a look at how Facebook reveals the time for breakups.

According to data pulled from Facebook, December is one of the most popular months to break up.

Mathias Mikkelsen posted the chart below, which he picked up from a TED talk by <a href="http://www.davidmccandless.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.davidmccandless.com/', 'David McCandless']);" >David McCandless</a>. As you can see people break up least in summer seasons. They break up most on festive seasons like December.

What could be the reason ? Well as far as I think, people get over excited with their relationships when the new year is approaching. With new year resolutions many wish for a new and better relationship. One more reason I could think of is, people are on holidays so they think about it a lot and when they are busy working they don&#8217;t care so much.

What do you think ? Do share your thoughts with me.
