Redesign of YouTube was probably a tough nut to crack for the folks at Google, as it was playing around with a very popular layout. The [new layout was available thanks to a hack][1] but starting today it will be available for all users.

Thankfully YouTube does not mirror other Google products and the distinct identity of YouTube has been left intact.

## Emphasis on Social Connections

YouTube is Google most successful social network. Yes, it does have [Google+ which is growing fast][3] but YouTube has become a great social product even without a real plan of becoming one.

What more is that YouTube has an awesome 3 billion videos viewed on it. So it is natural that with the new design social interaction would come to the forefront. The overall management of your videos, comments on them and socially shared videos is organized a lot better than before.

Users can also connect their social profiles from Facebook, Twitter, Orkut and MySpace to YouTube.  Google+ activity shows up automatically.
