Google+ from day one had a better layout, better way to manage sharing and better privacy controls than Facebook. Facebook probably knew they had a real competitor out there.¬†Facebook is probably a little nervous and its evidence are the sheer number of changes it has rolled out over the past 2 months.

It started with the tie-up with Skype for video chatting, then allowing [much-needed tag approval feature][1], allowing [bigger and faster photos][2], [changing sharing options][3], [introducing new smart lists][4] where friends are added automatically and finally becoming more like Google+ and Twitter by allowing anyone to view¬†[publicly shared posts with &#8216;Facebook Subscriptions&#8217;][5].

Yesterday, Facebook made so many changes to its layout, that it was a little hard to really keep up with them. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## The New Facebook!

  1. **Sticky Bar at the top:** This is borrowed from Google+. The new bar at the top stays even when you scroll down. This makes it a lot easier to navigate and I like this change.
  2. **Change in Profile Options:** The privacy options and other account settings options are neatly hidden under a drop down next to the Home tab. This might make it a bit difficult for some non-regular Facebook users to quickly find privacy options.
  3. **The Update Ticker:** The real-time updates by friends on Facebook can be a big¬†distraction. I do not like¬†continuous¬†updates filling up. It reminds me too much of my Twitter timeline. üòâ
  4. **Home Update:** The main updates from feeds are shown with a blue triangle at the top. You can mark it as &#8216;Top Story&#8221;, so it becomes more prominent when you visit your Facebook account next.
  5. **Lists and Updates:** This is the best new change about Facebook. The Lists, groups, events, pages are all shown differently in a categorised way. This makes it very easy to share things with people you really want to.

<div>
  Sometimes too many changes can upset some people, and Facebook has changed drastically. It is hardly recognizable since lets say 2 months ago.

<div>
  One thing that happens with competition, is that companies stop taking their customers for granted. Facebook has stopped taking its users for granted.
