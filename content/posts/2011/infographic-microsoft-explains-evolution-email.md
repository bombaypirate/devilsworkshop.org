Email has come a long way, from writing instant letters to cousins and friends aboard to actually becoming a way to exchange files, information and links. Email accounts are now often used to fire-up interaction on other services like chat, social networks and more.

Here in an infographic by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/office/core/images/EvolutionEmail_Vertical_web.jpg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/office/core/images/EvolutionEmail_Vertical_web.jpg', 'Microsoft']);" >Microsoft</a>, which shows how Email has evolved over the last few decades.

I personally use email a lot more since I was in college. This is because work still relies a lot on Email compared to social networks. But earlier, jokes, funny images and interesting links were shared via Email. Now almost everyone does this on their respective Facebook or Twitter profile. I wonder if such networks with replace Email in the future.

Do drop in your comments.
