Whoa! What&#8217;s wrong here? Did we miss out something? Well, according to a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2011-06-14-facebook-got-defriended-by-nearly-6-million-people-in-the-us-last-month" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://perezhilton.com/2011-06-14-facebook-got-defriended-by-nearly-6-million-people-in-the-us-last-month', 'source']);" >source</a>, almost 6 million people deleted their Facebook accounts in US last month.

So, now the total number of active users in the United States has reduced from 155.2 million to 149.4 million only. A good number of people I must say! It is said every madness has an end, is this the end to what we called Facebook madness or this is just a normal upside down that Facebook may be experiencing.

Inside Facebook&#8217;s Eric Eldon said,

> From my experience, I get the sense that being on Facebook is not cool anymore. The early adopters and trend-setters are moving away. [But] these are also exactly the type of people brand advertisers want to reach; if they are leaving, it doesn&#8217;t look good for Facebook.

There are people adding or deleting their Facebook accounts due to several reasons. Some think that Facebook makes them work less or some just bored enough of it. Which group are you from?

I am scared if Facebook&#8217;s future is like Orkut? Well, if you do wish to delete your account permanently, <a href="http://fbknol.com/permanently-delete-facebook-account/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/permanently-delete-facebook-account/', 'here']);" >here</a> is how to do that. For others stay connected and continue &#8220;Facebook-ing&#8221;.

Anyways, what could be the reason? Twitter getting more popular or are  people just bored of Facebook sneaking into profiles? Well, whatever the reason may be, I think Mark Zuckerberg has to act fast!
