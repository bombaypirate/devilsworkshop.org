Yeah Facebook now gives you a freedom to choose from different relationship status. Earlier there were only married, in a relationship , engaged etc. The option for civil unions or domestic partnerships is only available to Facebook users in the US, Canada, the UK, France and Australia now.

Facebook people also said that these options were made for the region that have asked for it. Response will be seen and monitored and slowly these options will be rolled out to all.

What do you think about this ? Share your views with me.
