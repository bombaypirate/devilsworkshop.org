One of the best features Firefox is missing when compared to Chrome is the Omnibar. This innovative feature is not available in any of the major browsers. You may just think that Omnibar is *Address bar + Search engine*, but it’s a lot more than that! You can use it for complex calculations, unit conversions, send mails instantly and much more!

## #1. Omnibar as a Unit converter and a Calculator

Apart from simple additions and subtractions, Omnibar can also perform complex calculations, for example trigonometric functions like that in the image.

[<img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="omni" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/06/omni_thumb.png" border="0" alt="omni" width="552" height="76" />][2]

You can also convert one system of units to another, usually it takes less than a second for the result to appear.

[<img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="omni 1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/06/omni1_thumb.png" border="0" alt="omni 1" width="551" height="76" />][3]

These two tricks require internet connection, if you want to do math offline, then checkout Calculator extension.

## #2. Send E-Mails from the Omnibar

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-chrome-omnibar-address-bar-omnimail/" target="_blank">Previously mentioned OmniMail</a> makes it easy for the users to send E-mails. You just need to install the extension, authorize it (it need to access your Google contacts) to get started. To send an E-mail, type *mail **email@site.com** *and with a click, a new tab opens with Gmail’s compose mail option.

[<img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="omni 2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/06/omni2_thumb.png" border="0" alt="omni 2" width="558" height="110" />][4]

## #3. Focus on Omnibar quickly

We generally use cursor to focus on the Omnibar, but we can also use *Ctrl + L *keyboard shortcut to do that, that can save you a couple of seconds.

## #4. Send SMS from your Omnibar

[<img style="display: inline; border: 0px;" title="omni 3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/06/omni3_thumb.png" border="0" alt="omni 3" width="634" height="55" />][5]

If you’re a mobile fanatic, you may be knowing about Way 2 SMS which is a mobile portal only for Indians, you can send free SMS to any person in India using their service. Yesterday I came across an great extension which simplifies the process of sending SMS using Way 2 SMS. After installing the extension, login through the options menu. You just need to type *<Mobile no> <Message> *and you’re done! This will definitely save you a lot of time.

## #5. Clean your Omnibar’s Search engines list

[<img style="display: inline; border: 0px;" title="omni 4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/06/omni4_thumb.png" border="0" alt="omni 4" width="351" height="350" />][6]

If you use a lot of search engines, then it will be difficult for you to switch between different search engines. Fefoo can solve this problem, it is similar to <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/multiple-search-engines-simultaneously-searchr/" target="_blank">Searchr</a> but a lot better than that. It has 70+ search engines of different kinds, there’s a toolbar at the top of page using which you can switch from one search engine to another. You can make Fefoo as your default search engine using the <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/add-custom-search-engines-chromes-omnibox-address-bar/" target="_blank">trick I have mentioned</a>.
