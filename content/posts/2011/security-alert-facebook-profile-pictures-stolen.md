A dating website hacked Facebook users profile photos and put on their dating website. Well, this is something serious about the security of Facebookers !

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5602" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/Lovely-faces.com_.png" alt="" width="604" height="466" />][1]

I just got to know that a website called <a href="http://lovely-faces.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lovely-faces.com', 'lovely-faces.com']);" >lovely-faces.com</a> stole about a million photographs from Facebook. They categorized these people under some categories like nationality, gender, funny, smug, easy-going and climber. When you go to this website, you are shown a number of faces according to the above categories. When you click on any of them, you are led to a page that has expanded view of the image. You can either give comments on that image or go to their Facebook profile.

The creators of the online &#8220;dating agency&#8221; were identified at the website as artists Paolo Cirio and Alessandro Ludovic. When asked the reason of doing this, they said,

> Our mission was to give all these virtual identities a new shared place to expose themselves freely, breaking Facebook&#8217;s constraints and boring social rules.

They also mentioned ,

> So we established a new website giving them justice and granting them the possibility of soon being face to face with anybody who is attracted by their facial expression and related data.

Whatever reason they may give, this sure is against Facebook&#8217;s policy. I hope something is done against it. Can any one take away or copy the images and put it to their websites? What do you think about it ? Share your views with me.
