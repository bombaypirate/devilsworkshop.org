Google Docs is one of my favourite ways to co-ordinate work with colleagues. Sharing and allowing people to work on a document in real-time is a great idea. Recently, Google is allowing only giving access to commenting on a document you share.

This is useful when you want some users and their opinion but do not want to grant them rights to make changes themselves.

  * Just open the document you have on Google Docs which you want to share.
  * Click on ***Share*** and add the people want to share the document with.
  * Now select a new option ‘***Can comment’* **and click on ‘***Done***’.

Here is a video I made on how to only allowing comments while sharing a document.

Do drop in your comments and view.
