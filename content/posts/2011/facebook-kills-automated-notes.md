I decided to check my Facebook profile on my browser and came across a curious looking announcement by Facebook. They are killing off automatic importing of posts from your blog or website onto Facebook Notes.

This basically meant that if your had hooked up RSS feed from your blog to publish on Facebook notes automatically, it will not be possible anymore.

Users can still create individual notes but the message also actively promotes sharing of links on your wall.

### Facebook&#8217;s focus on the Wall

Facebook has changed a lot of things in the past few months. This is probably a response to Google+ being launched. They have already got rid of [Discussion and Review  tabs for Facebook Pages][1]. With automatic notes being removed, it seems Facebook wants people to share anything and everything on the wall and not anywhere else.

I think a lot of Facebook users will not like automatic publishing to Notes being discontinued, as it was a useful way to read posts without leaving Facebook. But I guess this decision will also get rid of spam that might be getting generated.
