According to a recent study it says your zodiac sign will be changed in 2011. So, people everywhere are finding out what their new zodiac will be and how will the day go by accordingly.

The study shows that people who were in a particular zodiac sign are now in theÂ preceding one <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/13/new-zodiac-sign-dates-oph_n_808567.html#s223863&title=kristin_leigh" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/13/new-zodiac-sign-dates-oph_n_808567.html#s223863&title=kristin_leigh', '(source)']);" >(source)</a>. For example if you were a pisces now you can be an aquarious.

Facebook has an <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/getyourhoroscope/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/getyourhoroscope/', 'application']);" >application</a> that tells about how your day will go according to the zodiac sign. You just have to click on the application, select your zodiac and see the result. You can also publish the result if you wish to. I find this application much better than others on Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I enjoy reading my horoscope daily and thought you too will enjoy doing that so telling you. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What do you think of it? If you have any other application in mind do share it with me through the comments below.
