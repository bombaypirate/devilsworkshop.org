Most bloggers write posts part-time and manage to find some time to create new content which is appreciated with Facebook ‘Likes’ and Twitter ‘Retweets’.

But nothing says &#8220;I like your post&#8221; like money does. And Flattr allows bloggers to contribute small sums to good bloggers they appreciate.

## How <a href="http://flattr.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flattr.com', 'Flattr']);" >Flattr</a> Works for Bloggers

  * If you are a blogger, then sign with Flatter. Mark out some money you are willing to be distributed.
  * That money could be as less at 3 Euros (the site has default currency as Euro).

  * This money is then distributed to other bloggers on whose posts which have the Flattr button and users have shown appreciation by clicking on it.
  * As a blogger, you can also earn money by adding the ‘Flattr’ button on your blog posts. Flattr supports WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr and other popular blogging platforms.

I find the concept behind ***Flattr*** a very good one. To be honest, it is not a replacement for advertising revenues from blogs but mainly useful for new bloggers to get recognition and some revenue from people who appreciate their content.

Try out Flattr and tell me if you like the concept? Do drop in your comments.
