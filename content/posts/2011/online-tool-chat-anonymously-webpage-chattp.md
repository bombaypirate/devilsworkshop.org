Since I started blogging, I have been forced to think about online privacy. One reason is that bloggers or for that matter anyone who works online, ends up in contact with a lot of people who they do not really know as people. Mostly we can work around this problem, but sometimes there needs to be a discussion, lets say about a blogâ€™s design.

***Chattp*** is a nice online tool which adds a chat column to any webpage, henceÂ two or more people can discuss the content or design of the page in real-time. ðŸ˜‰

## Features of <a href="http://chattp.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chattp.com', 'Chattp']);" >Chattp</a>

  * Just visit the Chattp website and type in the URL of the page you want to discuss with someone.
  * A short URL is created, which can be shared with others who you want to take part in the discussion.
  * Anyone with whom, you have shared the link, will then be able to take part in the conversation in the left-hand column as a Guest.
  * Best part is requires no registration and is completely free.

This sort of collaborative tool would be ideal for people who work online and discuss projects on websites. Do try out Chattp and drop in your comments.
