As a web user, there is a good chance that you have more than a handful of apps on your computer. I like installing and checking up on new apps all the time. Sometimes the problem is, we can lose track of all the apps that are out there.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="allmyapps_logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/allmyapps_logo_thumb.png" border="0" alt="allmyapps_logo" width="302" height="302" />][1]

I find All My Apps, a useful website because I can look up all free and paid apps online in one single place.

## <a href="http://allmyapps.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://allmyapps.com/', 'All My Apps']);" >All My Apps</a> Features

  * The apps are all arranged neatly under different categories like web, office, games, video and even development for developers.
  * A list of all the apps you need to download and install on your computer can be created within seconds (image below).

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="allmyapps_list" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/allmyapps_list_thumb.png" border="0" alt="allmyapps_list" width="445" height="269" />][2]

  * After registration for a free account, I could share the list of apps I chose via Twitter and Facebook. I could also share this through a widget on my blog, thanks to an embed code that is generated.
  * A helpful feature is a trending apps list which shows the apps that are now popular and new. This is a great way to keep in touch of new useful apps there might be out there.

If you are looking at a backup of all free apps you have, it will a good idea to have a list created on allmyapps and bookmark it.

Do try out All My Apps and drop in your comments.
