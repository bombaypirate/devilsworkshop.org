Facebook Chat is a very popular feature of Facebook but technically and feature wise it&#8217;s not good as compared to other IM services like Skype and Yahoo Messenger but still people use it only because it&#8217;s integrated with Facebook. But here&#8217;s a trick using which you can make it little exciting and add a new feature to it. Using this trick you can add any profile picture of a profile or page to your chat.

1. Open a chat window of any friend. Now copy a profile&#8217;s id or username of a profile. See the examples below; use same method for a page:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Profile id:</em></span>* *The profile ID for the profile **https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=000000000** will be **000000000**.**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Username:</em></span>* *The username for the profile **https://www.facebook.com/sauravjit** will be **sauravjit**.

2.* *Once you copied the profile id or username go to chatbox and type that id or username within double square brackets. For example [[sauravjit]] and hit enter. Now the [[sauravjit]] part will show my current profile picture in the chat.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><img class="size-full wp-image-48953 alignleft" title="chat secrets" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/chat-secrets.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="287" /></em></span>

3. Use same method for pages, copy a page&#8217;s username in case it&#8217;s having one or simply copy the number from the page&#8217;s link.

Don&#8217;t forget to give it a try with your friends. You can also use these profile pictures as a smiley.
