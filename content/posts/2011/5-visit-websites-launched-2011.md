With about trillion of websites on the Internet, I know you don’t want to waste time sitting and reading this part of the article.. So let us move on towards what I have to share with you all. These websites were all officially launched on the **1st of January 2011** but may be registered long before the launch date, pretty natural huh!

## #1. Indiavibes

The first Web HD TV in India which will host a large collection of TV shows and movies.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW w1jan1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-w1jan1_thumb.png" border="0" alt="DW w1jan1" width="242" height="65" />][2]

What’s so extraordinary – It boasts of using adaptive streaming which will practically let you watch Videos without any interruption or buffering.

What’s not so extraordinary – You cannot download any show or movie as it uses adaptive streaming.

## #2. ItsHacked

This one is particularly a niche website (blog) for people who are interesting in  topics like Hacking, Network Security, Identity theft etc.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW w1jan3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-w1jan3_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="DW w1jan3" width="156" height="33" />][3]

What’s so extraordinary – The website is fast, looks simple and uses a Tag cloud also.

What’s not so extraordinary – Frequency of posts is low and design do not looks like a priority.

## #3. UK Government Data

Yeah, yeah I know… Please do ask me what’s so interesting about sharing a Government site with you! My answer would be “see it yourself and then decide”.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW w1jan2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-w1jan2_thumb.png" border="0" alt="DW w1jan2" width="141" height="42" />][4]

What’s so extraordinary – Being a Government website, it’s nicely designed and organized. The best part about this website is that it opens up a lot of data from the Government of UK for the public to see, analyse and see summaries. You can even create applications using the wide data available.

What’s not so extraordinary – Not such a nice website if you are not much interested in Socio-IT trends.

## #4. Teach Parents Tech

This one is from the house of Google which has made an interesting move by trying to help Parents and older people nice stuff about technology and a great ‘How-to’ series. Anybody can introduce their parents or someone they know of having less knowledge related to things on a Computer.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW w1jan6" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-w1jan6_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW w1jan6" width="244" height="70" />][5]

What’s so extraordinary – The website is nicely designed and looks cool, yeah the Google style! It is simple & quick to use and has nothing much hidden.

What’s not so extraordinary – The website provides a platform for the young ones to share Technology videos to their parents and other old pals. However nothing apart from videos has been put in place, also what if someone doesn’t even know how to install the plug-ins on a browser to run videos!

## #5. iPhone Experience

What else will you need if there is a dedicated blog explaining you different tips and tricks about your iPhone, isn’t that cool? Everyday the blog comes out with some new application for iPhone which let you decide what all to keep on your own piece.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW w1jan7" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-w1jan7_thumb.png" border="0" alt="DW w1jan7" width="260" height="54" />][6]

What’s so extraordinary – The blog is truly dedicated to iPhone and just iPhone. The frequency of posts is quite good for now and quality of content is fine.

What’s not so extraordinary – Design blocks are not organized properly and the colour scheme must be revamped. The topic is displayed in a font which looks quite not so good to my eyes.

Few interesting ones which I could not ignore (though they will be launched later in January):

  * <a href="http://ticketplease.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ticketplease.com/', 'TicketPlease']);" target="_blank"><strong>TicketPlease</strong></a>

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW w1jan4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-w1jan4_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW w1jan4" width="244" height="82" />][7]

An Ajay Devgan company, TicketPlease is going to launch on 10th January. The website is similar to Bookmyshow.com which also sell tickets for movies, concerts, plays and other events. Ticketplease will also let  you buy movie CD and DVDs.

  * <a href="http://www.zingsocial.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zingsocial.com/', 'Zing Social']);" target="_blank"><strong>Zing Social</strong></a>

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW w1jan5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-w1jan5_thumb.png" border="0" alt="DW w1jan5" width="288" height="59" />][8]

Looks like another social networking website but with a difference in its Privacy features. The beta version of the website also claims to have 1 lac users and is going to launch officially on 15th January 2011. The website sources maintains that they are not looking for any competition with established portals like Facebook or LinkedIn.

I hope you liked this post and interesting too, let me know guys about some interesting topics you would like me to cover or review.
