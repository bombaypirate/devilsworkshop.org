Facebook groups are a good way to interact with a number of people at the same time. You can share a post, photos, videos, events, documents simultaneously or you can even ask a questions. But a negative point of these groups is that admins or your friends can add you in  a group without your permission which leads to flooding of useless updates in your notifications page. One option of stopping these notifications is to unjoin that group, but there&#8217;s an alternate solution too where you can stop these notifications while staying in that group.

### How to stop group notifications:

  * Open the group from which you want to unsubscribe. You can see all your groups on this page>> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/groups" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/groups', 'https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/groups']);" >https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/groups</a> (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/groups" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/groups', 'open in a new window']);" target="_blank">open in a new window</a>).
  * Click &#8216;Edit Settings&#8217; given on the top with the group&#8217;s name.

  * This will open the custom notifications, see the screenshot below.

  1. Select &#8216;Only posts I am subscribed to&#8217; to completely stop notifications from that group, you will not receive any notification even if the admin posts. If you want updates from a post click &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; link given with that post.
  2. Uncheck this box if you don&#8217;t want notifications as an E-Mail too.
  3. This box enables group chatting, if you feel that pop-up appeared by group chats are annoying too, then uncheck this box as well.
