Finally, after yesterday&#8217;s much confusion Facebook made it clear that they are not going to shut down. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-is-not-going-to-shut-down/facebook-not-shutting-down-2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-is-not-going-to-shut-down/facebook-not-shutting-down-2/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-5097"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5097" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Facebook-not-shutting-down1.png" alt="" width="600" height="83" /></a>

??Facebook said,

> ### We didn&#8217;t get the memo about shutting down, so we&#8217;ll keep working away like always. We aren&#8217;t going anywhere; we&#8217;re just getting started.

Many people I know gave a sigh of relief that it wasn&#8217;t going to shut down any time soon. There are people who especially commented on the post and asked Facebook not to shut down.

News that it will be shut down was spread as a joke by <a href="http://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/27321/facebook-will-end-on-march-15th" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/27321/facebook-will-end-on-march-15th', 'Weeklyworldnews']);" >Weeklyworldnews</a> and it became viral. It became the most searched word on Google and twitter too.

Whatever the reason, at the end we know that it is not shutting down. So, no worries. Lets get back to our photo and privacy fights! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Share your views through the comments below.
