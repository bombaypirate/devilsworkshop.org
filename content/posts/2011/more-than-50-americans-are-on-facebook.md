This is Edison&#8217;s 19th study on digital media-related topics. Edison has tracked the growth of Facebook since 2008 and says the site was only used by 8 percent of Americans of the same age just three years ago.

Edison Research polled 2,020 people ages 12 and up to reach its conclusions. Since 2008, Facebook usage has increased, especially among people 35-years-old and up, the study says. There are many children on Facebook too and Facebook tries it&#8217;s best to remove such profiles. Facebook deletes 20,000 profile pages everyday<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-bans-20000-underage-users-everyday/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-bans-20000-underage-users-everyday/', '(Source)']);" >(Source)</a>.
