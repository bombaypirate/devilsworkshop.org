Zoufounoun lead major acquisition in Google and it probably seems that Facebook is planning to buy some new companies. It seems Facebook has hit the ground running when it comes to acquisitions, by purchasing Snaptu. Snaptu is a popular mobile applications platform. The purchase by Facebook is pegged at $40 million.

Google unlike Yahoo, built its business buying small companies with unique products. I think Facebook is doing the same. This is a wise idea as it makes assimilating smaller companies into their own culture quite easy.

What are your views on Snaptu’s acquisition of Facebook? Do drop in your comments.
