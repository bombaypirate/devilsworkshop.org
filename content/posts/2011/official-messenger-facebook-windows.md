I like staying logged into Facebook on one tab of my browser, so I can chat with my friends on it. Thanks to the option of disallowing people from certain lists to see you online, it is perfect ( thought chatting service itself is far from perfect on Facebook) . Facebook has released a new messenger for windows platform, that allows users to be logged in and chat with friends from the desktop itself.

  * The messenger is not very different from the one on the browser. As a matter of fact to use the messenger, I had to login first from the browser on to Facebook.
  * It can also be docked on the right-hand side on your desktop, just like the browser version is docked.
  * I have used [Digsby to chat with friends from Facebook][2] but if you want Facebook like chat on desktop this one is better.
  * I found the new ticker being present in then messenger a little annoying. It is one reason I prefer to use 3rd party messengers instead of the browser. I wish future updates allow turning off the news ticker on the messenger.
