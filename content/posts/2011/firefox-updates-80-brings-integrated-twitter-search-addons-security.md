<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/firefox-7-superfast-challenge-chrome/" target="_blank">Firefox 7’s release</a> was just a month ago and Mozilla has uploaded the 8.0 version unto their FTP servers. The newer version brings a couple of improvements like bug fixes, performance boost and a better way to handle 3rd party add-on installations.

## Improvements in Firefox 8

  * **3rd party Add-on installations: **If you’ve installed Java before on your PC, then you know that it will install Java Console add-on on your Firefox automatically, without your permission. This is going to change in Firefox 8, Firefox now handles all the 3rd party add-on installations itself, thus better security.
  * **Twitter Search: **Twitter is now embedded in the search bar.
  * **Tab animations: **Firefox shows interactive animations when you drag or reorder tabs.
  * **Faster startup: **Firefox now starts up as fast as Chrome.

Other small features like rendering HTML5 context menus have also been added.

The update is scheduled for tomorrow, but if you can’t wait, you can download the update now from Mozilla’s FTP servers, just hit the link below.
