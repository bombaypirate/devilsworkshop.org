Either through my friends on Twitter or Facebook or even a blog post. Sometimes I come across a nice video thanks to related videos showing up. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This is how most people discover new content on YouTube, but in this way I might miss out on some trending videos not discovered by my social circle.

YouTube Charts is the URL, which shows up some awesome stats of new videos.

  * YouTube Charts allows looking up the most viewed videos across all categories.
  * I could select the time frame from most viewed from today, past week, month or even all time.
  * The best part is it also shows videos based on most number of liked, most commented, most viewed in HD, and even most subscribed.

I have used YouTube charts in the past couple of days to look up new trends. This way I doubt I will miss out on what is the latest rage when it comes to viral videos. It is also a great way to discover new content on YouTube.

Do look up YouTube Charts and drop in your comments.
