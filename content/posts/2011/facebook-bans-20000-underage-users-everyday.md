Facebook has a policy with strict age limits, but thousands of children lie about their age to gain access to the site. The chief privacy adviser for the site, Mozelle Thompson, spoke with the Australian Federal Parliament’s cyber-safety organization and noted that the site deals with child users all the time,

> There are people who lie. There are people under thirteen. Facebook removes twenty thousand people a day, people who are underage.

The company said,

> At Facebook, we take safety very seriously and we were pleased to take part in a hearing in Australia to talk about our safety policies, practices and systems.As we explained in the hearing, these efforts include removing numerous accounts everyday for activities including spamming, posting inappropriate content, and violating age restrictions.
