[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="blackberry_playbook" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/06/blackberry_playbook_thumb.png" border="0" alt="blackberry_playbook" width="350" height="251" align="right" />][1]Blackberry was the big fish for the smartphone industry. That position seems a little shaky with Apple iPhone gaining a lot of users, fans and momentum. Apple has taken the Indian market seriously after 3G services have gone live. They did this by introducing the iPad 2 and iPhone 4 in India.

Now, Blackberry is waking up to Apple iPad2 threat in India, by introducing the Playbook tablet this month.

## Blackberry Features

  * The tablet is 7.6 inches wide, while it is less than 1/2 inch thick. This makes it really lightweight and the advantage it has over iPad is that is can actually be carried around with a lot more ease.
  * It has 1024X600 screen resolution and has support fro Full adobe Flash 10.1. This seems to be a backhanded slap to Apple for refusing to have support for Flash on their iPad.
  * It runs on 1GHz processor with 1 GB RAM. The price of the 16GB version of BlackBerry is approx Rs. 32,000 but I have not been able to confirm it on their website.

It seems, India will see a number of tablets being released as 3G connections become more common. For BlackBerry, the success of Playbook is important as they would not want their phone users to use iPad and get introduced to the iOS platform. This is because the iPad users in India, might actually end up buying an iPhone instead of a BlackBerry which could be further bad news for RIM.
