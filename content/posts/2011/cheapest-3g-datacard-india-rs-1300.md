We all know about data cards available from Tata DoCoMo, BSNL and Reliance, however what we donâ€™t know is that Data cards are nothing more than Mobile phones without their screen, keypad and other features. ðŸ˜€

Then why they are sold for such high costs, sometimes even more than the costs of good mobile phones available in the market?

Reliance and Tata have always been selling their Data cards for about Rs. 2500-3000 with <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/?p=35821" target="_blank">BSNL presently selling their 3G Data card (upto 7.2 Mbps)</a> for Rs. 2500 (that too after a discount!). Finally two Indian students from Bhubaneswar in Odisha (formerly Orissa) have announced their latest innovation, a 3G data card for just Rs. 1300. The data card is presently not available in the market, however it is trying to tie up with biggies like Future Group to make its presence in the huge Indian market.

The innovators even claim that they can bring down the cost of the Data card to only Rs. 900 if they receive any support from the Government to manufacture on a large-scale. They are even expecting this to generate large-scale direct/in-direct employment.
