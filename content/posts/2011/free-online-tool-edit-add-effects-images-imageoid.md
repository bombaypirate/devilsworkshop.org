If you use only a single computer, there is a good chance that you have some decent image editors on the computer which can resize or add effects to images. If you use multiple computers and use different computers on different days, it becomes quite tedious to download and install new image editors.

<a href="http://imageoid.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://imageoid.com/', 'Imageoid']);" >Imageoid</a> is one such online editor for images that allows resizing images along with adding a lot of effects and then downloading it.

  * Upload any image file on the website and wait for adding effects on it.
  * I could chose through adding upto 32 different filters or image effects on the uploaded image.
