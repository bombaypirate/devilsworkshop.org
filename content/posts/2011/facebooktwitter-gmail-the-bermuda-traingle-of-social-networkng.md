Ever wondered what Facebook, Twitter and Gmail does to you and your work ? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have a look at the image below and you may know it.

I found this image from internet. It exactly tells what happens to a man who is stuck with these social networking websites. He is all lost, just as it happens with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle', 'Bermuda triangle']);" >Bermuda triangle</a>. It&#8217;s like a non ending circle which attracts you towards itself, while you are working. If you work on internet a lot then you must have experienced it! ðŸ˜€

I have experienced such a thing. How many of you agree with me in this? Share your views with me here.
