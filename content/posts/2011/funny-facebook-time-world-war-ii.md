I have come across this funny image on the internet so thought of uploading it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have a look at it.

This is a nice way to think what would have happened if Facebook was at that time. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Just have a look at the wall post that says Germany and italy are now married. ðŸ˜‰

What all I can say is thank God Facebook was not then. Share your views with me. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
