Google+ pages is similar to Facebook pages but unlike Facebook, Google+ is backed by the worlds most powerful search engine.

For example, try searching for &#8220;***+Gmail***&#8221; on Google and it directly takes users to Gmail&#8217;s brand page on Google+. This is done through a feature called &#8216;Direct Connect&#8217;.

Currently Google has not rolled out Direct Connect for all users, but you can start by getting your blog and Google+ page ready for Direct Connect.

## Adding your blog&#8217;s link to a Google+ page

  * Login to your Google+ account and create the page. Read this [post to find more about creating pages][1].
  * Now on your new Google+ page look up &#8220;Edit Profile&#8221; and click on it.
  * Now on **About** tab, click on &#8220;**Link**&#8221; and select &#8220;**Custom Links**&#8220;.
  * Alternatively you can also add the link on **homepage link** on About Tab.
  * Add the name of your website and the URL.

## Adding Google+ Page link on your blog

There are two ways to go about it. One way is to add a Google+ badge on your website. The other is by adding a link in the head section of your website.

### Creating Google+ Badge

  * You can create the Google+ badge for your <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/badge/config" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/badge/config', 'page at this link']);" >page at this link</a>.
  * Enter the ID of your page and look through the options for creating the badge.
  * Copy and paste this code to create a badge for Google+ page on your blog.

### Adding a link on your blog

Incase you do not want your website to feature Google+ badge of your page, then you can add a link of the Google+ page to the head section of your website.

The code to be added is below:

> **yourpageID]&#8221; />**

Here **yourpageID** is the numerical page ID of your Google+ page. Using  **[yourpageID]** makes sure that the link is not visible on your page.

Now your Google+ is qualified for Google&#8217;s Direct Connect. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
