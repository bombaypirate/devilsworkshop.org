Did you notice that Facebook wants to know where do you live? Facebook is prompting users to enter where do they live.

Today when I logged into my Facebook account I saw on the right hand side that its asking about the location. As you can see in the image below that Facebook is asking its users to write where do they live.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-live/location/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-live/location/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-5208"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5208" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Location.png" alt="" width="254" height="181" /></a>

Nobody knows the reason for the prompt. May be this is just a way of knowing more friends. When you see a person&#8217;s location you may want to know more about him. When you see an update on the right hand side, you are interested in knowing more about the person.

Did you see the update? Have you shared your location on Facebook? Share your views through comments.
