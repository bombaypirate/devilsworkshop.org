If you like uploading your photos to online photo sharing websites just because they are safe and no one can save protected images from it then think before you upload. These websites are not 100% safe and anyone can save pictures from it as there are thousand ways to do that. Let&#8217;s take an example of one of the most famous photo sharing website Flickr by Yahoo. You have an option of disabling downloads of photos you upload. If you enable this no one can save your photo and it will show &#8220;The owner has disabled downloading of their photos&#8221; with that photo. Let&#8217;s see how you can save such photos.

### How to save images from Flickr:

  1. Firstly open the image you want to save and go to Actions>>View all Sizes, to view the image in actual size.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-46035" title="flickr save images" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/flickr-save-images-600x300.jpg" alt="" width="492" height="246" />
  2. Now select the largest size. That largest size is the actual size of that photo.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-46038" title="flickr images saving" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/flickr-images-saving-600x256.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="209" />
  3. Now simply press Ctrl+S to save the page and save it to your desktop or any other desired location. You can also save the link by clicking on &#8216;File&#8217; on the &#8216;Menu Bar&#8217; and click &#8216;Save Link as&#8217;.
  4. This will save that page (link) and a Folder with that which contains all the images on that page. Open this folder and you will find the desired image in that folder.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-46039" title="Image from Flickr" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/Image-from-Flickr-600x448.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="384" />

That&#8217;s it; you can find your image in this folder, copy and paste it to anywhere else. You can also save an image by viewing Page Source (by pressing Ctrl+U) of the same page that we saved earlier. View page source and find the link of that image there. Click on that link and save the image.
