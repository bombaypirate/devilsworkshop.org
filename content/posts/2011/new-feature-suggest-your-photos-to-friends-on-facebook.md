Did you notice this new feature on your Facebook profile ? You can choose to suggest your photos to friends on Facebook. Have a look at the image below.

I saw this feature today when I was just checking my privacy settings. This is under Privacy settings->Customized settings. No body is sure of the exact time when this was rolled out.

As far as I know I this feature prompts your name for tagging if the photo looks familiar to you. In short it will let people tag you in a better way.It would have been better if this feature let us stop the photo suggestions. Photo suggestions are those photos of you that appear on the right hand side of Facebook profile.

Did you also get this feature on your Facebook profile ? How did you find it ?:) Feel free to share your views here.
