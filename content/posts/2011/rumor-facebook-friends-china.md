There is a rumor going around that Facebook will end up entering China thanks to a partnership. Facebook has no presence in China and considering there are over 1.6 billion people in China, it must look like the obvious place for growth for the company.

The rumour was broken first by <a href="http://www.thomascrampton.com/china/facebook-signed-with-sina-to-enter-china/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thomascrampton.com/china/facebook-signed-with-sina-to-enter-china/', 'Thomas Crampton']);" target="_blank">Thomas Crampton</a>, a social media watcher for China and Asia.

According to the website

> Facebook really is about to enter China, the agreement is signed. A domestic website will work with Facebook to create a new site. This new site is not interlinked with Facebook.com. Will this live or die in China?

## Why Facebook might not be acceptable in China?

We have seen in the recent protests in Egypt, that Facebook was quite liberally praised by the protestors. This is something that China will be very sensitive about and might not allow a fully functional Facebook.

But Facebook having some sort of presence or partnership with Chinaâ€™s search giant Baidu, might give it a nice leverage against Google which has recently unplugged its services from China.

What are your views about Facebook entering China? Will it help the company more or harm it? Do drop in your comments.
