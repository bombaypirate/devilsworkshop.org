Facebook users are being tricked into clicking on links which claim to be raw CNN footage of the Japanese tsunami. This is a plot to earn money by driving web traffic to take online surveys.

Once again a new scam comes on Facebook, making loads of people click on it and spread it throughout! When you click on the link, you are shown a video and asked to complete a set of online survey! This message gets automatically posted on your friend&#8217;s wall.

If you have already clicked this link, remove it from your wall post. Just stop it from spreading more. The best way is to avoid clicking on anything you are not sure of. Stay safe ! Did you experience this , if yes then what did you do ? Share it with me here.
