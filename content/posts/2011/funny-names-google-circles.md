Google Plus is really in the ascendancy, Â so much so that almost everyday we are publishing a post on it. One of the nifty ideas with Google+ is that it has posting options and comments like Facebook, while you can follow and be followed independently like on Twitter.

Google+ allows users to organize their contracts into Circles and most users give it names like &#8216;School Friends&#8217;, Work Friends&#8217; etc.

But in reality we organize people into lists on social media so that we can filter their updates. These lists usually mean something completely different from their actual names.

So do you have similarly named Circles on Google+? Do drop in your comments.
