Interesting right ? Mark Zuckerberg changed his status from being single to &#8216;in a relationship&#8217;.

As reported, Facebook&#8217;s CEO has been dating his girlfriend Priscilla ChanÂ since college but it was only this week that he made it clear for the world that he is in a relationship. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

What could be the reason of delaying this ? It is slight surprising when Facebook&#8217;s creator himself is not so active on Facebook. By now people are so much into Facebook. Every person instead of asking the phone number asks for the Facebook ID. Share your view with me.
