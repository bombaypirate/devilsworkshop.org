Everyday, I get about 100 emails from different people, friends and even blogs. Browsing through those emails I read their sender’s name, the Subject and the boring date & time however what I miss is the personal touch which I get while talking to them over phone or meeting them up.

Today, suddenly my friend ‘Rakshit’ asked me to see SocialGmail, a Chrome extension. I thought must be something usual which I often get recommendations from my friends and colleagues. Though when I tried it out, I was amazed to see the way it works.

SocialGmail adds a row of Avatars (iconic pictures) to your email conversations just before the sender’s name. This happens only if they are personally connected to you on Gmail and not for unknown people or anonymous emails.

I was just thinking that this should have been a Gmail Labs application instead of being a Chrome extension. What do you think? Let me know your suggestions and please do post your comments as that is the biggest encouragement I receive for writing. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
