Acer has become a household name in India when it comes to netbooks or laptops. Lower priced than other brands, Acer has marked a niche for themselves in India. So it is not really surprising that they have launched a range of tablets in India. The most impressive of them seems to be the Acer ICONIA Tab A500.

This is a very smart move by Acer, to come up with tablets earlier than other brands in India. This is obviously on the back of [iPad 2 being made available in India][1].
