Okay, I know, after reading the title you may be thinking of the self-driving cars Google use, you&#8217;re wrong. Google Drive is Google Docs revamped. It&#8217;s more like Dropbox or Box.net.

Previously no one was sure about the existence of Google Drive, but now, TechCrunch has got some leaked screenshots of Google Drive. Apart from this, there are many other rumors that, Google will be releasing Google Drive as soon as Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is released. This is because Google Drive will certainly be integrated into Android and may be Chrome OS/Chrome too. Think of it like [Apple&#8217;s iCloud][2].

If Google Drive (which comes as a standalone app)  gives storage of more than 10 GB, which I think will happen, as Gmail alone gives you 7GB space for your Emails, and more over if it releases its API, then it has good chances to be a Dropbox killer.

What are your views on Google Drive? Excited?
