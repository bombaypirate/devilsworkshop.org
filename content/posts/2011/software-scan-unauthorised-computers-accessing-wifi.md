A wireless router does allow a great amount of freedom. Most people with a laptop will end up getting themselves a wireless router, so they can be anywhere in the house while using their computers.

Tablet computers and smart-phones usually can hook up to a wireless router which means most WiFi networks have usually more than one device connecting to it.

  * Just install the software on your computer and start scanning your wireless network.
  * It looks up the router you are connecting into and also shows a list (as seen in image above) of all the devices connected to the wireless network along with its MAC Address.
  * This works only on Windows XP and onwards.

This is perfect to scan your network from time to time, to make sure no one unauthorised is accessing your Wi-fi connection.
