One of the main reasons why Dropbox is the best file syncing service is that there many 3rd party apps which enhance it, Dropbox has released its API long ago. A few [file syncing services like Wuala][1] haven’t released their API and this is a serious drawback.

***DROPitTOme*** is a web app with which your friends can start uploading files to your Dropbox without even having a Dropbox ID, this is quite handy as no one will prefer to sign up for a site just to send some files to his friend.
