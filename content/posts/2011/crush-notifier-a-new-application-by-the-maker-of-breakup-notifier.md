Were you sad when Breakup Notifier was disabled by Facebook? Well, the maker of such application has created another one named Crush Notifier. What do you think ? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Creator Dan Loewenherz has released a new application named &#8216;Crush Notifier&#8217;, which lets you know if your crush has crush on you. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Nice! I would love to use this application. Best part is it will just mail you about it all, no sharing of information on Facebook.

On being asked, Loewenherz said

> I&#8217;m totally bummed!Â It&#8217;s been very frustrating dealing with Facebook, they&#8217;ve been very noncommunicative. I don&#8217;t like sitting around on my butt but I try to not let things like that get in the way of making cool stuff.

I guess, Facebook should have no problem with this application now. How many of you are going to use it ? Share your views with me here.
