Deleting awaiting friend request on Facebook is now so easy. Facebook released a new feature saying &#8216;Cancel Friend Request&#8217;.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/new-featuredeleting-awaiting-friend-requests-become-easy-on-facebook/new-feature-3/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/new-featuredeleting-awaiting-friend-requests-become-easy-on-facebook/new-feature-3/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-5129"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5129" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/new-feature2.png" alt="" width="193" height="160" /></a>

Earlier when people wanted to delete a pending friend request(which has been sent) they had to either go to the profile and delete it <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-delete-an-awaiting-friend-request-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-delete-an-awaiting-friend-request-on-facebook/', '(Source)']);" >(Source)</a> or install a <a href="http://fbknol.com/use-unfriend-finder-to-keep-a-check-on-facebook-friends/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/use-unfriend-finder-to-keep-a-check-on-facebook-friends/', 'Greasemonkey script']);" >Greasemonkey script</a> to do that.

Many people have asked me how to delete awaiting friend request. Well, in this case you can cancel the friend request by going to that friend&#8217;s page. This feature appears in the left hand side of the page.

What do you think of this feature? Share your views with me.
