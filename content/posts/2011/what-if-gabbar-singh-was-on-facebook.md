Yes, what if Gabbar Singh was on Facebook? How would his Facebook profile look like ? Well I found this image on internet so thought of sharing with you all. Have a look at the image and let me know what you think of it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

[<img class="alignnone size-large  wp-image-50545" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/gabbar-profile-600x575.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="575" />][1]

It&#8217;s really funny to see Gabbar&#8217;s likes and friends. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This is a nice example of creativity. I think almost anything can be done withÂ [Photoshop][2]. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What say !
