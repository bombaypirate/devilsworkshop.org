Google Plus has the full backing of Google behind it and evidence of it is how many people have adopted it in its early stages. Google+ has raced to 10 millions users in 2 weeks. This landmark took Facebook 852 days while it took Twitter 780 days.

Here is a nice presentation <a href="https://plus.google.com/112418301618963883780/posts/B3s3dd739bG" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/112418301618963883780/posts/B3s3dd739bG', 'Leon Håland on Google+']);" >Leon Håland on Google+</a> brings out the contrast between the initial growth chart of Google+ compared to Twitter and Facebook. What is more incredible is that Google+  is invite based and not open to everyone.

This proves that Google+ is being accepted and looks like they have finally a winning social product on their hands. It might be interesting to see the strategies adopted by other companies who might be threatened by Google+.
