Have you ever given thought to the exact percentage of shares any Facebook employee has?

Well, today I came across this interesting information and thought of sharing this with you. Have a look at the infographics given below.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-chart-which-shows-who-owns-what/who-owns-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-chart-which-shows-who-owns-what/who-owns-facebook/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-5135"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5135" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Who-owns-Facebook.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="456" /></a>

As you can see Facebook staff owns nearly 30% of the shares that equals to $15 billion whereas Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg owns an amount of $12 billion.

Not included differently are the other investors also having their shares like Microsoft’s 1.6% stake, Hong Kong billionaire Li-Ka Shing’s 0.8%, TriplePoint Capital (though as a debt provider they own nothing), and Accel Partners’ investment.

What do you think? Feel free to share your views through the comments below.
