[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="builtwith_onlinetool" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/builtwith_onlinetool_thumb.png" border="0" alt="builtwith_onlinetool" width="304" height="304" align="right" />][1]Webmasters and bloggers all over want to know more about their competition. This usually means looking up other websites. Getting too obsessed with the competition can actually be harmful, but a little bit of analysis and understanding is a good way to learn from your competition. **BuiltWith** is a website which allowed me to look up a lot of useful information on just about any website.

## <a href="http://builtwith.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://builtwith.com/', 'BuiltWith']);" >BuiltWith</a> Features

  * Just type in the name of the URL of the website you want information about. Once that is done a report is generated.
  * I could look up the websiteâ€™s technology profile. Information like which servers are used and which platform, the site was hosted on including the version of the platform. It also gave information regarding which analysis tools (eg: Google Analytics) and advertising services (eg: AdSense, Ad Words and infolinks) were used.
  * Also it look up information on the Widgets and social media features which are present on the website.
  * When it comes to SEO related information, I got to look up decent information regarding keyword frequency and top 10 keywords being used. To view SEO related information you have to register free to access the data.

As I continued using <a href="http://builtwith.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://builtwith.com/', 'BuiltWith']);" >BuiltWith</a>, I found it quite useful to learn about various other platforms and things common to websites using those platforms like Blogger.com or WordPress. I do not think it will be helpful to analyse your own website. Use this one to do a bit of spying on your competitors. ðŸ˜‰
