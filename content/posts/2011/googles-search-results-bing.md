I have sometimes wondered if [people choose to use Google instead of Bing, just out of habit][1]. I mean what is the big difference in their results. Google has a lot of options and small changes which make it intuitively great. These changes are usually not seen or understood all that well.

A great feature of Google is when we type in search query with a spelling mistake, it auto-corrects the query and shows relevant results. Bing also does that but according to a tip shared by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gsvineeth" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/#!/gsvineeth', 'Vineeth GS']);" >Vineeth GS</a>, it is not doing as good as Google.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="Google and Bing Search Results" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/11/Google_Bing_Search_results_thumb.png" alt="Google_Bing_Search_results" width="563" height="581" border="0" />][2]

The query entered was **‘jquery sldiers&#8221;** on both search engines. Both correctly offered to search for “jquery sliders” but the results being show is where the difference between Google and Bing is seen.

Google points to a link about jQuery Slider plugins and tutorials while the first link on Bing points to something completely unrelated.

It seems Google has auto-corrected not just the word, but it also auto-corrected it based on the context of the 2nd word in the query.

Bing does try to pull the occasional stunt of being innovating, especially by [introducing features like a movie running in the background of it’s search page][3]. This might be cool but adds nothing to getting the best results. While Google has features which are not that obvious but make the user-experience better even without the user realizing it.

Do drop in your comments.
