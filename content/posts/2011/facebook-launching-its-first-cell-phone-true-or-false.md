Mobile company Htc will be launching these phones which will work on Android software. Htc will make it public in coming days at a conference meet up in Barcelona. Htc made a draft of the phone design public, hence the news. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

What do you think? Will that be a success? What exactly Facebook phone is going to have? Do we need a Facebook phone even if we are able to check our profiles and everything through the application<a href="http://fbknol.com/snaptu-the-facebook-experience-redefined/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/snaptu-the-facebook-experience-redefined/', ' Snaptu']);" > Snaptu</a>?

Do share your views with me? Do you think that is n important thing to do or Htc wants to be in news so all this? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
