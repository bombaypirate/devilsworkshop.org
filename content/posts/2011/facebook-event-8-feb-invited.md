The conference will take place in Menlo Park City Hall, California, and many people have predicted that Mark Zuckerberg will tell the world that his company are moving their operations to the Silicon Valley city area. Wow, so finally Facebook headquarters are shifting their base.

Reason for this is not yet known. Why would Facebook shift, may be they want a bigger area, may be they just want a change ! Lets see what happens and what is decided . Till then let me know what you think is the reason.
