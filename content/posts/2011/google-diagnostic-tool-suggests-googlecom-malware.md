Google has a nice diagnostic tool for safe browsing. It usually scans for malware, trojans and gives an advisory. It is considered a reliable tool as Google does crawl web-pages over and over again repeatedly.

Strangely, when you look up the diagnostic page for Google.com, it shows instances of malicious software and trojans being hosted on it.

Check the screenshot below (click to enlarge it) and I have highlighted the parts where the diagnostic tools suggest Google.com is not all that safe for browsing.

[<img class="wp-image-51282" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/11/Google_Safebrowsing_Diagnostic_thumb.png" alt="Google_Safebrowsing_Diagnostic" width="570" height="394" border="0" />][1]

Check <a href="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=google.com', 'http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=google.com']);" >http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=google.com</a> and you will get to see the full report that suggests Google.com contains malware and is infected. To check other website replace &#8220;google.com&#8221; with the URL you want looked up.

I checked other domains belonging to Google, and they did not show up with malware warnings. I wonder what does this mean? Is Google.com not safe to browse? I am not certain it is as serious issue as yet, but it is strange indeed.

What are your views? Do drop in your comments.
