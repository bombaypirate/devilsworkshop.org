Even though our computers have a lot of applications, files and folders, there are only a handful that we use everyday. I use Chrome, Skype, Live Writer everyday but hardly use Internet Explorer. Same goes for some notepad files which I use often.

<a href="http://www.confavor.com/download.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.confavor.com/download.html', 'ConFavor']);" target="_blank">ConFavor</a> allows accessing our favourite files, folders and even applications from a single place. I can now access all my favourites from the desktop with a single click.

Adding these favourites is also very easy but either a single right-click and adding to favourites while on desktop or looking up files in folders.

For Windows Xp and Vista users, it also supports Context Menu, which means you can check your files, folders and programs from the start button as seen in image below.

Unfortunately context menu does not work for Windows 7, but works like a charm with Windows XP and Vista.

So now next time, when I want to launch a bunch of my favourite programs and files, I just right-click on the desktop and start launching the applications.

Thanks to <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/author/vibin/" target="_blank">Vibin</a> for the top and try out ConFavor and do drop in your comments.
