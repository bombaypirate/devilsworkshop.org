I grew up in Mumbai, and when I moved to Pune, India for a job, the first thing that troubled me was that figuring out public transport in the city. I was like any newcomer, who finds it very difficult to navigate around the city without real first hand knowledge of the roads around.

I guess with Google Maps we are better equipped to atleast have some idea of places which are new. Recently <a href="http://googleindia.blogspot.com/2011/01/google-transit-comes-to-pune.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleindia.blogspot.com/2011/01/google-transit-comes-to-pune.html', 'Google announced']);" >Google announced</a> that it has added all bus routes in Pune to Google Maps.

*Image above is my route from home to rtCamp office in Pune.*

  * Many might be familiar about Google Maps showing how to get from Place A to Place B. With Google Transit the idea is to show this information assuming you will be taking public transport, like the metro or bus routes.
  * In India Google Transit has covered the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=28.647657,77.171868&spn=0.146405,0.298272&dirflg=r" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=28.647657,77.171868&spn=0.146405,0.298272&dirflg=r', 'Delhi Metro']);" >Delhi Metro</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=22.557973,88.368932&spn=0.126376,0.047818&dirflg=r" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=22.557973,88.368932&spn=0.126376,0.047818&dirflg=r', 'Kolkata Metro']);" >Kolkata Metro</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=12.953947,77.59&spn=0.15,0.15&dirflg=r" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=12.953947,77.59&spn=0.15,0.15&dirflg=r', 'Bangalore Bus Routes']);" >Bangalore Bus Routes</a> (BMTC) and <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=13.029893,80.255727&spn=0.124793,0.072398&dirflg=r" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=13.029893,80.255727&spn=0.124793,0.072398&dirflg=r', 'Chennai MRTS']);" >Chennai MRTS</a>.
  * This makes it quite easy to look up public transport option for people visiting the cities or even for locals who might be unaware of certain routes.

I guess this is one more way we are soon going to become very dependent on Google. What are your thoughts? Do drop in your comments.
