It was the way people used ‘Lists’ on Facebook and the way ‘Circles’ were created on Google+.

It is probably this reason, that [Facebook has introduced new Friend Lists][2]. Organizing friends on Facebook is still a cumbersome process.

But some very resourceful developers have created an online application which allows you to create Facebook friend lists using an interface of Google+ Circles.

## Circle Hack Features

  * Just visit the website and allow it to access your Facebook details.
  * It will load a user-interface which resembles Google+ Circles but actually has Facebook Lists.
  * Create lists and simply drag and drop Facebook friends.
  * Contacts can also be moved from one circle to another.

I am definitely going to use ***Circle Hack*** until Facebook comes up with a better way to manage Lists. Do drop in your comments.
