Classy applications aren’t designed just for iPhones and Windows handhelds anymore.

There are many applications in the Android market as well. In this article, I am sharing 5 Android applications for people who are health buffs. Best of all, all 5 of these applications are free. So get started, use these apps for better health.

As you walk, run, bike, hike or involve yourself in any other athletic activity, your Google My Tracks is busy recording your path using its inbuilt GPS sensor. This application also gathers metrics such as the speed at which you traveled, the distance you traveled, at what elevation and how much time you took to complete your exercise.

My Tracks can also record data from several external sensors such as the Zephyr Technology Consumer HxM Bluetooth heart rate monitor.  You can share your My Tracks track data as TCX, GPX, CSV or KML or file.

This application converts your phone into a quick and accurate heart rate monitor. Instant Heart Rate does not require any external hardware to monitor your heart rate. You can use this app to optimize your exercise routine and to track your progress.

Instant Heart Rate uses a technique similar to the one used by medical pulse oximeters to measure your heart rate. Place your index finger on your phone’s camera when the app is on. The app measures your heart rate based on the color changes in the fingertip that are directly linked to your pulse.
