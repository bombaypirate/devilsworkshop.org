If you have joined Foursquare, and wondering how to replace that random number in your profile URL, this article can help you out.

By default, when you join Foursquare you get a profile URL like this &#8211;Â *http://foursquare.com/user/1466683*

How to change it to something like this ? &#8211; *http://foursquare.com/rahul286 ðŸ˜‰*

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36658" title="foursquare-username" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/foursquare-username.png" alt="" width="405" height="57" />

Its very simple actually. Go to theÂ <a href="http://foursquare.com/settings" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://foursquare.com/settings', 'Foursquare Settings']);" >Foursquare Settings</a> page and scroll down to find ***&#8220;Linked Accounts&#8221;*** section.

Next, link your Twitter account with your Foursquare account and your Foursquare username will be set equal to Twitter username. *(see screenshot below)*

<img class="size-medium wp-image-36657 alignnone" title="get-foursquare-username-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/get-foursquare-username-1-600x352.png" alt="" width="600" height="352" />

This may sound a bitÂ weird but this is the only way out. If you do not have a twitter account, you will need to create one in order to get a foursquare username!

Also, be careful as you cannot change your Foursquare username, even if you change the linked twitter account later-on! ðŸ˜‰

**Link:** <a href="http://foursquare.com/rahul286" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://foursquare.com/rahul286', 'Catch me on Foursquare']);" >Catch me on Foursquare</a>
