This is not the snapshot of the latest iOS5. This may be how the desktop of your Android Phone may look after you have finished reading this post.

Not only just that it looks like iOS, but apparently according to the description,

&nbsp;

> You can manage multi task and uninstall programs conveniently. Also the natural gestures operation gives you smooth and fluent user experience.

Although I find Android User Interface sleek, Apple has always been known for its aesthetic UI courtesy to their visionary co-founder Steve Jobs. Android on the other hand has tirelessly developed apps to make the smartphone market accessible to the migrating middle class.

Also, Espier not only offers the look and feel of iOS but it has also managed to bring the vibrating icon interface to Android, where you can

  * Club two or more Apps and sort them in folders
  * Directly uninstall an App by clicking on the shortcut
  * Drag and drop icons just like one can in iOS

Espier is an desktop app, so the underlying interface is still android. This is for Android lovers, who want to feel what an Apple UI seems like before buying an iPhone.  
Here is a video demo of the skin:
