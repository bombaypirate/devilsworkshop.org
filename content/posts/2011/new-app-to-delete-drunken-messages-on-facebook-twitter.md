The new iPhone application &#8211; called &#8216;Last Night Never Happened&#8217; &#8211; is such an application that deletes all embarrassing social network updates. It can be  bought for 1.19 pounds. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/', 'Apple&#8217;s App Store']);" >Apple&#8217;s App Store</a>.

This is a nice application simple to use. You just have to enter the time you are starting to drink. This app will delete all the posts starting from that time on Facebook and twitter.

This application can be a life saver for many. But, even if you are okay after drinking your tweets may get deleted any how. Well, you can decide if you are going to get drunk login to the application else do not. What do you think ? Share your view with me on this.
