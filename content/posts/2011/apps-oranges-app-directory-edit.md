Being an app junkie, I like trying new apps, in fact I’m writing this using Live Writer even though I could use WordPress’ default editor, because I prefer desktop apps. **Apps & Oranges** is a new software directory which aims to best permanent destination of apps.

## Features of Apps & Oranges

  * Apps & Oranges is basically a repository of apps related to all platforms, that includes Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and Web (sorry Linux!).
  * To get started, fill the blank in “ What are the best \___\___\___ apps in Windows” (or any other platform). If you need blogging apps, fill the blank with “Blogging”.
  * Next, you get a list of apps which are related to the question you’ve asked, you can vote the apps too.

  * Click on the app to get more information, you’ll be provided with a link to the developer site.  Apps & Oranges doesn’t host any apps.
  * Apart from voting, you can also add a review to the apps you’ve used.
  * If you’re interested in a topic, say blogging, then you can even follow the question “What are the best blogging apps for Windows” (or any platform) and you get an email, when a person posts a new app in that topic.
  * If there are none or fewer apps related to a topic, then you can add any of the apps you’ve used. Even the apps that are added by other members are editable, like Wikipedia.
