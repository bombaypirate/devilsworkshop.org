If you like looking up images online then Flickr is a good website along with deviant art or even [visualize.us][1] which is very useful for image bookmarking.

But another very common and a useful tool to search and lookup images online is using Google’s image search. Google does have a [neat way of displaying searched results for images][2]. Another cool service I came across is **Google Image Slideshow** which shows all the image results in a slideshow.

[<img class="wp-image-53236" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/04/Google_image_slideshow_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Google_image_slideshow" width="550" height="315" />][3]

  * The website picks up 60 images from Google’s image search and displays them in a slideshow.
  * The default search is the simple one bit advance options are also allowed to display only larger images, show images with a particular color being dominant and also a particular file type.
  * We can also restrict the search to a particular website so you can search on Flickr for images and get them displayed in a slideshow.

If you are looking for images and have some time to kill, then looking up Google Image Slideshow is a lot of fun. Go give it a try and let me know your views in your comments.
