PDF files are good when you want to look up an article or even a chart. I have a few interesting pdf files with helpful and informative diagrams. Sometimes I want to covert these PDF files into an image format.

I found pdf2jpg a useful online tool which converts a PDF file into JPG image file.

  * Just upload your PDF file and click convert to get image files.
  * Sometimes as JPG images can take some time if the PDF file is large. In this case there is the option of leaving a email alert which sends an email when the conversion is complete.
  * Unfortunately the only drawback was that it can only manage pdf files which upto the size of 10 MB. This usually should not be a problem in most cases but PDFs with images usually are quite large-sized files.

This is a great tool to manage PDF files along with some others that allow converting a <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/convert-any-url-to-pdf/" target="_blank">URL to PDF</a> and also convert <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/convert-pdf-files-to-dochtml-and-txt-format-easily/" target="_blank">PDF files to Doc, HTML and Txt format</a> with free online tools.

Also if you are looking to search for PDF files online, then these <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/5-great-ways-to-search-for-pdf-documents-online/" target="_blank">5 search tools</a> will be quite helpful.
