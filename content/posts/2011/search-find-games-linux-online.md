Linux stands shoulder to shoulder with Windows when it comes to performance and User Interface. But it loses out when it comes to software compatibility.

Many such issues are solved by using open source alternatives which are not as good as the paid ones. Hence when it comes to gaming, everyone prefers Windows as it supports a lot of games.

Also, another drawback is we do not find a lot of games that run on Linux. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
