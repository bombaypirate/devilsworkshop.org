Lately, in March I wrote a post on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/9-tips-google-chrome/" target="_blank">9 tips to get most out of Google Chrome</a> and now this is the second part of it. This post includes pinning tabs, tweaking start pages, creating favicon-only bookmarks and more!

## #1. Pin Tabs

Even before Mozilla had introduced their Firefox 4,  stuffed with App Tabs feature, Chrome already had a similar feature named “Pin Tabs”.

When you pin a Tab, it shrinks so that you can only so its favicon. This feature is mainly targeted for power users who deal with lots of tabs.

To Pin a Tab, Right click on that Tab and select “Pin Tab”.

## #2. Update Plug-ins

Outdated plug-ins can make your browser vulnerable, but this is not the case with Chrome because whenever you visit a site which requires a plug-in and if you don’t have a updated version of that plug-in, then you will be notified. However, you can check the status of all your plug-ins using ***about:plugins*** page.

***about:*** pages are special pages which gives info about memory, plug-ins, upcoming features and more! Type ***about:about*** in Chrome to get the list of all the ***about:*** pages

## #3. Favicon-only Bookmarks

I organize my bookmarks using folders but I keep some of the sites (which I visit daily) on bookmarks bar, now it will mess up my bookmarks bar. Here’s a tricky, silly solution to organize bookmarks placed on your bookmarks bar.

[<img title="chrome tips 1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/chrome-tips-1.png" alt="" width="470" height="84" />][4]

  * Right click on the bookmark you want to make favicon-only and click edit
  * Make sure the “name” field is empty, if not then empty it and click ok.
  * That’s it, now the bookmark will not show the text, it will only show the favicon (which is enough to recognize the site).

## #4. Start Page

We have already written an article about <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/6-ways-customize-chromes-tab-page/" target="_blank">start pages available for Chrome</a>. Those include MyFav.es, Incredible start page, Speed Dial, Speed Dial 2 and many more.

A good start page can do wonders for your productivity online, especially if you work online.

## #5. Using Chrome Bookmarks Intelligently

So you’ve replaced Chrome’s boring new tab page with <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/6-ways-customize-chromes-tab-page/" target="_blank">a stylish start page</a> and then your mind triggers, how to access Chrome apps? Here’s a simple solution. Open one of your Chrome apps and bookmark that page (I know, the address bar is empty), that’s it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Installed lots of apps? then don’t hesitate to create a separate bookmarks folder for it.

## #6. Use Side Tabs

Using a wide-screen monitor? then Side Tabs feature is for you! Generally browser tabs are at the top of Chrome’s window, but when you enable Side Tabs feature (head on to ***Chrome:flags*** to enable it), the browser tabs appear at the left side of Chrome. This feature doesn’t suit normal monitors as the meta tags do not appear completely.
