Facebook is launching an application Snaptu, to make user experience of Facebooking a better one on mobile phones. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Facebook said they want people to have a better mobile experience, no matter which phone they are having. It does not matter if the phone is a smart phone or not. Many people in-spite of having a smart phone do not use Facebook so effectively.

They are launching a new mobile app to make Facebook the most popular thing on phone also. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The Facebook for Feature Phones app works on more than 2,500 devices from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, LG and other manufacturers, and it was built-in close cooperation with <a href="http://www.snaptu.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.snaptu.com/', 'Snaptu']);" title="http://www.snaptu.com/" rel="nofollow"  target="_blank">Snaptu</a>.

This is an application that provides a better Facebook experience. This includes a better navigation of home screen, contact synchronization and fast scrolling of photos and friend updates (this is seriously required, I must say). This will be made easily available to as many people as possible, I wonder if this will be launched in US as usual and will keep us waiting like Facebook messages. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Well, don&#8217;t worry there are 14 mobile operators listed below which will be offering free data access when using the new Facebook mobile app during the first 90 days after they launch. The list is as :

  * Dialog (Sri Lanka)
  * Life (Ukraine)
  * Play (Poland)
  * StarHub (Singapore)
  * STC (Saudi Arabia)
  * Three (Hong Kong)

  * Vodafone (Romania)

Thank God India is under the list of launching soon. I just hope it happens soon. Because I am a smart phone user and I would really love to use this application on the phone. I really like using Facebook as much as possible but on phone it really does not work that great! Lets see what do we have in store for us. Do share your views with me.
