Google also gave out a small peek at changes that we will see in 2011 on Blogger.com.

Blogger, is probably the most used blogging platform as most new bloggers end up starting on Blogger. WordPress is a great platform because of how much it can be customized. But it, does need a little technical knowledge and many casual bloggers usually prefer Blogger.

Below image is how the new Blogger Dashboard should look like!

## Expected new features of Blogger

  * The dashboard looks clean and better organised.
  * It will also have new content discovery features which will help discover related content while reading a post.
  * The design in Blogger.com will use Google Web Toolkit which is known to be used for creating browser applications.
  * The real-time stats are pretty nifty with Blogger anyways, I think in the new redesign they might put more emphasis on real-time stats. After all this is where it probably has a bit of an edge over WordPress.

### Change in Blogger’s focus?

I think there has been a change in focus for Blogger. It probably realises that it cannot be a platform like WordPress. WordPress is a used mainly when people want their website to look professional. Blogger has realised that it’s main clients are new or casual bloggers who just want to write things and share them with friends and family. With that in mind, Blogger might become more user-friendly.

*Take a look at Blogger’s video on things to expect in 2011.*
