If you have been always pinning your eyes into that small mobile screen finding the important mails through the long list, the news comes as a pain reliever for you. With Google finally introducing it’s niche feature **Priority Inbox**, it is expecting more and more users to switch to the service. Till now, only desktop and Android users could use the feature, however now any Mobile browser supporting HTML 5 shall make the feature accessible for you.

You need to set up the Priority Inbox feature on your desktop version first and then only it will be available to you on your mobile web app. Don&#8217;t forget to drop in your comments.
