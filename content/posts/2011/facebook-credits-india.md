Facebook&#8217;s much-loved feature is the Facebook games. Farmville, Cityville, Cafeworld and many more. Most people log in to Facebook everyday to check their farms, city or restaurant and they need Facebook credits to get the good stuff in the game. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Now, Facebook credits come to India.

Who ever plays Facebook games must be knowing Facebook Credits. We have once written <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-free-facebook-credits/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-free-facebook-credits/', 'how to get those credits']);" >how to get those credits</a>, for free. In games like sorority life I have tried many times to get credits and saw that these things are not for India. As reported by <a href="http://news.in.msn.com/business/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5062207" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.in.msn.com/business/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5062207', 'msn']);" >msn</a>, Facebook credits are made available for Indians now.

<a href="http://beam.co.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://beam.co.in/', 'Beam']);" >Beam</a>, a mobile-commerce company, has sought the Reserve Bank of India&#8217;s permission to make Facebook Credits available in India. Beam&#8217;s Chairman and Managing Director Anand Shrivastav said,

> We have a young subscriber base (60 per cent of Beam&#8217;s users are below 25) and are, therefore, driven by what they want us to do.

Facebook gives points to subscribers based on usage and lets users buy virtual stuff on the site. It retains 30 per cent as fee. Facebook Credits reached a new level of popularity earlier this month when <a href="http://fbknol.com/warner-bros-about-to-rent-movies-via-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/warner-bros-about-to-rent-movies-via-facebook/', 'Warner Brothers']);" >Warner Brothers</a> decided to stream Batman: The Dark Knight on the site. We Indian&#8217;s missed the chance to watch it online because of the unavailability of Facebook credits here.

For 30 Facebook Credits (equivalent of $3), one could have watched the 2008 movie over 48 hours, with an unlimited amount pauses. So, is that a threat to other mobile service providers ? Will this service be available to only Beam users ? Share your likes and dislikes here about the news.
