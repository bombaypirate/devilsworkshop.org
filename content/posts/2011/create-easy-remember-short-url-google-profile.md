I have liked using Google Plus for a few days, but found the Google+ ID a little too tedious to remember. The Google+ profile is basically a numerical id and very difficult to share with people. There is no way to customize this profile id into a login name.

But there is a quick fix for that which is not from Google+ but a third-party tool called **GPlus.to**.

Just look up your Google+ profile ID and insert that number along with your nickname into the online tool.

[<img class="wp-image-51216" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/gplus_short_URL_thumb.png" border="0" alt="gplus_short_URL" width="540" height="334" />][1]

Now with this I have a more easy to remember URL for my Google+ profile as *Gplus.to/adityakane* instead of the long and difficult to remember URL *plus.google.com/u/0/116447136547996635976. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />*

I am pretty sure that once Google+ is out of beta it will soon make this feature available but until then you might want to use Gplus.to.

Do drop in your comments.
