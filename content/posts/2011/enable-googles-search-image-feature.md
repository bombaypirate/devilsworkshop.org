A lot of them are unknown and Google Images has been a good way to search images online.&nbsp;Google has now enabled Search by Image, where in you can even drag and drop an image into the search from your desktop.

This works by default on the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel', 'Chromium browser or Chrome Developer Build']);" >Chromium browser or Chrome Developer Build</a> but is not available on all browsers as yet.

## Search by Image Features

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Google_images_search_by_image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/06/Google_images_search_by_image_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Google_images_search_by_image" width="570" height="413" />][2]

  * Go to <a href="http://images.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://images.google.com', 'http://images.google.com']);" >http://images.google.com</a> and we get to the search bar. If you are using the Chrome developer version, we can see the camera icon at the end of the search bar.
  * Enter the URL of an image from the internet or even drag and drop an image from your desktop as shown in image above. The search results will show similar images using the image to search the internet.
  * This probably borrows a lot from Google Googles which is an app with Android and carries out similar search by image.

Here is a video demo by Google on the new search by image feature



So try out Google Search by image on your Chrome browser and do drop in your comments and views.
