Facebook has been working a lot with Skype recently with it allowing users to use Skype to chat with friends on Facebook. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg had claimed that there would be something new and awesome unveiled by Facebook.

That announcement has been Facebook Video Calling. The video calling will allow Facebook users to chat with friends via a browser using Skype.

Just head over to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/videocalling" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/videocalling', 'http://www.facebook.com/videocalling']);" >http://www.facebook.com/videocalling</a> and click on get started.

Then you be prompted to choose from your friends who you want to start a video chat.

Click on the video icon and download the one time plugin for your computer.

This way we can start video calling our friends right from the browser and no need to use Skype software.

This is obviously a new feature that targets Google+ service called Hangout. It will be interesting to see how this plays out and how Facebook reacts to challenge thrown at it by Google.

Here is the Video presentation by Facebook
