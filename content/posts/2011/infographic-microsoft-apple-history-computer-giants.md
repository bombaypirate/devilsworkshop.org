Both, were new start-ups and when compared to IBM, no one gave much of a chance to either company. The two companies not only have managed to race ahead of any other tech companies over the years but have been locked in a battle of sorts against each other, over the past 20 odd years.

Recently, [Apple overtook Microsoft in revenues and profits][2] but chances are that is not the end going by their history.
