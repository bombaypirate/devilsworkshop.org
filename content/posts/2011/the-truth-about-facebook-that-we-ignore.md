Well, this is so true, we spend most of our time on Facebooking without knowing the real people with whom we are communicating. I agree when it says in the image about the suggested friends, we almost are not familiar with every person who is a friend of our another friend. What I always suggest is use your friendship in a better way, you cannot risk it all can you ?

Share your views with me. What points are correct in the image above and on what points you do not agree at all.
