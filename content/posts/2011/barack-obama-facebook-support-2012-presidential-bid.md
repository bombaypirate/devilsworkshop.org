The US President, Barack Obama has kicked off his re-election campaign on the internet. If you visit the official site <a href="http://barackobama.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://barackobama.com', 'http://barackobama.com']);" >http://barackobama.com</a> then you will that the website offers two ways to get people into the campaign. One is by leaving their email address and zip code. The other one is by asking them to login using Facebook credentials.

Barack Obama does also have a Facebook Page which has over 19 million fans. Interesting in 2008 election campaign Obama was very internet savvy by having his videos and write-up being available through Facebook and YouTube.

Also Facebook does have lesser spam bots and most people on it are real. So it is not a bad idea for a politician to tap into the power of Facebook.
