Apple gadgets are generally considered to be expensive. Even in the smart-phone category, an iPhone 4 is right up there as one of the more expensive products. There is a whole demographic that Apple does not tap into. This is about to change, as Apple is developing a cheaper version of iPhone4.

[<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40608" title="iPhone4_india.png" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/iPhone4_india.png" alt="" width="310" height="237" />][1]According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/23/us-apple-iphone-idUSTRE77M1P220110823" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/23/us-apple-iphone-idUSTRE77M1P220110823', 'Reuters']);" >Reuters</a>, an 8 GB iPhone 4 is being manufactured by a South Korean company.

It is obvious that the cheaper iPhone 4 version will be targeted towards the mobile markets of India and China.

The phone will Â be unveiled around the same time [iPhone 5 is expected to be introduced][2].

## Effects of Cheaper iPhone 4

  * iPhones have tremendous brand value and at the end of the day a cheaper phone will obviously eat into the profits of other mobile makers like Nokia, which also dominates the niche of cheaper phones.
  * It also might start putting the pressure on Android which also has made its presence felt with cheaper models.

This might be a good strategy by Apple to break out from North America and Europe into the emerging markets where ultimately growth will lie.

What are you views on a cheaper iPhone? Will you buy one? Do drop in your comments.
