Some people are still not so confident of storing data on the cloud for reasons of control, privacy and mainly offline access.

But I am sure that even Google would be stumped by these observations made by Vishwa Bandhu Gupta, a former additional commissioner on income-tax  in this video, who claims cloud computing will be affected when it rains.

## Video

I am not sure if the person is serious, but he looks quite convincing.

Maybe he needs to attend [ABC Cloud Computing – India Forum to be held in Mumbai][2] for a free pass (which you can win by taking part in the contest). The forum will have presentations about Cloud Computing by many IT Heads from various MNCs.

Do drop in your comments.
