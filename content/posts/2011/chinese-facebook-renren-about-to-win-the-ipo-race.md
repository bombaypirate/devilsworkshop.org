Renren is a six-year-old company that is called as &#8220;the Facebook of China&#8221;. Well the news is it may be the first social networking site to go all public. It is estimated to have 22m active users, renren is the largest site of its kind in China.

Facebook <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-ipo/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-ipo/', 'may go public']);" >may go public</a> in may 2010, which is estimated to beÂ <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-earned-600-million-profit-2010/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-earned-600-million-profit-2010/', '$600 million']);" >$600 million</a>.Â Along with this there are other websites also that are planning to go public including Twitter and YouTube.

What do you think ? Point is will Facebook really go all public or it&#8217;s justÂ rumorsÂ ? What if Facebook wants to continue with its privacy. Share your views with me on this .
