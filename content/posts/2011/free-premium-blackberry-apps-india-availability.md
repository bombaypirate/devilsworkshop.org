Research in Motion (RIM) will be offering some premium Applications for free for BlackBerry users in some countries worldwide including India. RIM announced this offer to make frustrated customers happy who are unhappy due to <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/blackberry-services-bbm-affected/" target="_blank">a major service disruption last week</a>. You can download these premium applications for free from October 19th till December 31st 2011 from the BlackBerry App World. Well BlackBerry isn&#8217;t going to give you these premium applications free for all 70 days; rather they will launch it one by one and for a shorter period of time.

### Availability in India:

Unfortunately not all the applications are available in India and not even some of them.There&#8217;s just one application available for downloading that is &#8220;DriveSafe.ly Pro by iSpeech.org. Hopefully some better application we be available soon as DriveSafe.ly is a low rated application that&#8217;s not liked by many BlackBerry users including me.

Are these applications available for you to download in your region? Don&#8217;t forget to tell us.
