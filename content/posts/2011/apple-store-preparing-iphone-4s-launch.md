This is a quick post to inform you that Apple store is down as the event for the launch of Apple&#8217;s new phone will begin in few minutes. When I tried opening Apple Store I got the note that:  
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46240" title="Apple iphone launch" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/title_backsoon1.gif" alt="" width="564" height="168" />

It clearly means that 15 months long wait is over now and Apple is going to reveal its new iPhone and iOS 5 soon with some changes in its present iPod models. But the confusion is still there that the newer iPhone will be 4S i.e a phone same as iPhone 4 with few modifications in it or it will be iPhone 5, a completely new phone. Also people are waiting for Tim Cook as this time when Steve Jobs won&#8217;t be there on the stage who&#8217;s the original man behind iPhone.

Stay connected for more iPhone 5 related updates.
