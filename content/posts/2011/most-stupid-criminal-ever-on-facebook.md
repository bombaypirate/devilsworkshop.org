Well, this is the story of a man who stole the laptop with money and jacket and posted it on the victim&#8217;s Facebook page . Phew, how stupid as well as just see the guts of that thief.

Last December, Rodney Knight Jr, 19, broke into the house of Washington Post journalist Marc Fisher and lifted &#8220;a bunch of stuff&#8221;, including cash, a winter coat and a laptop computer belonging to the hack&#8217;s 15-year-old son.

Later he took his snap and posted it on the child&#8217;s Facebook page. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> While investigating the crime, DC police officer Kyle Roe admitted:

> I&#8217;ve seen a lot, but this is the most stupid criminal I&#8217;ve ever seen.

Knight, the thief got arrested later this January. He has been given a title of stupid thief ever. What do you think ? Share your views with me here.
