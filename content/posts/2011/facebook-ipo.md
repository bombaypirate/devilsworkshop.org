Facebook has seen tremendous growth in the past 2 years and along with it, Facebook has made some very unpopular decisions which turned out to be the rights ones as time passed.

Numerous times the layout was changed, notifications were changed and also new things added like locations, messages etc. Not to forget default privacy settings became more and more private over time. This helped Facebook grow but a lot of users ended up not trusting Facebook. As a company Facebook, could manage to take such unpopular decisions because it was a privately held company. Mark Zuckerberg was not really answerable to the public and other private investors probably trusted Zuckerberg implicitly.

Strangely, the popularity of Facebook and its ever growing list of investors might force it to give out a Initial public offering (IPO). Under the rules in the U.S, any company with more than 10 million dollars in assets and over 500 shareholders has to go public.

## Facebook will have to reveal profits and revenues!

If Facebook goes public, they will have to go public. In Facebook terminology it will mean, it will lose its privacy settings completely. As once, a company is public, it has to release accounts, share holding patterns and also take their investors (both public and private) into confidence before they make big changes.

So when users lost out on their privacy, Facebook simply ignored the issue. Do you think Facebook will behave the same way after it loses its own privacy.

Do drop in your comments.
