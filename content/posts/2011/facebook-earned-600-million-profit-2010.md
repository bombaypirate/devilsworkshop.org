Facebook generated about $250 million of net income in the fourth quarter of 2010. Facebook profited $355 million over 2010&#8217;s first 9 months. So, if we add the two that makes a total of $600 million. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

With this growth there is chance that Facebook Inc will be generating an amount of $2 billion in 2011. And there are chances that it will overcome that also, it will surpass $4 billion in 2011.
