With the rise of retailing, came the rise of the now familiar bar-code. The black and white bars of differing widths, can encode a certain amount of information. This information in shops is usually prices and serial numbers for more efficiency. On tickets a barcode might be used to counter black marketeers.

**Barcode yourself **is a web tool with which we can create our personal barcode with information like age, gender, location.

  * The website basically allows entering some vital personal information like your gender, age, country, height and weight.
  * Then this information is taken and a barcode is generated.
  * I had the options of downloading this bar-code as an image on my computer or evening getting a printout.

With Phones that can read bar-codes and even create them, such tools can be quite useful to encode details without being to obvious.
