We do see all kind ofÂ FacebookÂ addiction these days one of which is to get a Facebook tattoo. This was almost unbelievable for me but well, have a look.

Well for records,Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Pain" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Pain', 'T-Pain']);" >T-Pain</a> is a famous American song writer, rapper , singer. Just as celebrities go for different tattoos on themselves Â he got one that says you don&#8217;t have to Like me. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Just showing himself and telling people he doesn&#8217;t care about any one if they like him or not.

Its is kind of overÂ confidenceÂ I Â guess. What if after some days we may see tattoo parlours specializing in the Facebook art? Boards saying &#8216;We do customized Facebook Tattoos just like your profile pic, or some applications&#8217; etc. What about people talking &#8216;Hey I just got that new farm animal&#8217;s image drawn on my back..my friend is gonna love it! &#8216; ðŸ˜€

Funny right? But thought-provoking. What if Facebook closes down tomorrow, what will happen to those people with the tattoos? I can&#8217;t imagine that. Well, what do you think? Is Facebook taking a toll on our lives? Express your feelings here.
