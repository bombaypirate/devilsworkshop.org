One of the most important features of Facebook albums was to see all comments of an album in one place so that you can reply all of them without opening every single pic of the album. But Facebook removed this feature just like many other important features that made Facebook albums quite boring and lesser user friendly.

But this feature of Viewing all comments is back again. Facebook launched it recently without making any official information on their blog so users are still not familiar with it. Also there&#8217;s an additional feature that you can not only view comments of pictures in your album, but also for the pics your friends have uploaded.

To check comments on the pics of your album, open an album and find the *Album View *and *Comment View* button on the top right of the page. While *Comment view* enables you to view all the comments of that particular album, *Album view* button can be used to switch back to normal album view where you can watch only the pics without comments. Check the screenshot below.
