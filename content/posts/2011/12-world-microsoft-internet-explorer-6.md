Yes, it is official and no one else than Microsoft made it official. 10 years and now Internet Explorer 6 will no more be officially supported by the company. And guess what, Microsoft is too happy to bring IE9 to people worldwide.

As in Feb 2011, the usage of IE6 stands at 12% of the world total. If we hold our looks towards the Chinese percentage, it’s a rocking 34.5% followed by South Korea where about 25% people still use Internet Explorer 6. Isn’t that surprising?

It is quite surprising that Microsoft is promoting it’s new Internet Explorer 9 by creating a bad word about Internet Explorer 6. Microsoft through it’s dedicated website wants to bring the IE6 usage to less than even 1%. I have seen no other company doing so in the past, probably Microsoft is all about creating a difference <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-style: none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" alt="Winking smile" />
