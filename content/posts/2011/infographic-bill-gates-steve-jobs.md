The information technology world has been pretty much shaped by two industry giants. Bill Gates the man behind Microsoft and Steve Jobs the man behind Apple. Both have been often pitted against each other, very much like their respective companies have been.

A few months ago we featured an [infographic on Microsoft Vs. Apple][1]. Now here is one that has a brief history of Bill Gates in comparison to Steve Jobs.

The two tech leaders are now retired and probably we will see new wave of tech leaders. Chances are we might not see two tech giants of this stature ever be on opposite sides for such a long time.
