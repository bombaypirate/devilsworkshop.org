Another major announcement and the tickle within me to share it with you all. Lenovo, a company which acquired the ThinkPad division of IBM in 2005 and finally took over its manufacturing as well as marketing.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW lenovoTseries" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-lenovoTseries_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW lenovoTseries" width="529" height="432" />][1]

In a recent announcement, Lenovo is upgrading its T-series laptops with new processors, upgraded battery life and boot faster. The upgraded models, namely 14” T-420S and 15.6” T-420 will get the new Core i5 and i7 processors, respectively. While the new T-420S laptop claims to boot 30% faster, the thick & heavier T-420 series laptops claims to run upto ***30 hours on a single full charge*** of its 9-cell slice extended battery.

I am not yet sure about the market price in India, though reports suggest a starting price of $1329 and $779 for the T-420S series and T-420 series laptops, respectively.
