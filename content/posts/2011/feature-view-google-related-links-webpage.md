[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Google_related_Logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/08/Google_related_Logo_thumb.png" alt="Google_related_Logo" width="150" height="150" align="right" border="0" />][1]Google is ramping up itâ€™s search service big time. Recently it introduced [Google+ posts being included in social search results][2]. Now it has added a new feature called ***Google Related***. This is a <a href="http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/08/find-more-while-you-browse-with-google.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/08/find-more-while-you-browse-with-google.html', 'new feature']);" >new feature</a> which shows Google related links to any page that you are viewing.

This means if you are looking up a website to buy books, at the bottom of the page, there will be a bar that shows Google related links. These are links to Google Places, YouTube Videos, Google Images and more.

## <a href="http://www.google.com/related/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/related/', 'Google Related']);" >Google Related</a> Features

The best part of this service is, that is does not spam related links. I used it with [MySmartPrice, a website to look up mobiles and books prices][3] and got some neat related links from Google Related extension for Chrome (see image below).

It does not show up related links while looking at sites which are general. For example while surfing Gmail, Facebook or even blogs.

## Here is a video about Google Related



Use Google Related on Chrome or use it via Google Toolbar if you are using Internet Explorer. Do drop in your comments.
