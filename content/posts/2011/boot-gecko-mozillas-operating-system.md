This OS project has been named Boot to Gecko. The operating system will be yet another new platform in the already over crowded mobile platform market.

Boot to Gecko will be obviously looked upon as a competitor to Android as both will be open-sourced.

Also considering Mozilla’s OS will work on mobiles and tablets, Android might have some competition in this regard. It will be using basic features from Android itself for this open sourced project.

Here is a quote from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G', 'Boot to Gecko Wiki']);" >Boot to Gecko Wiki</a>

> We propose a project we’re calling Boot to Gecko (B2G) to pursue the goal of building a complete, standalone operating system for the open web.

Android OS does not release the source code in real-time while Mozilla is promising to release the source code in real-time which could be mean real co-ordination with developers.

### Will it challenge Chrome OS or Android?

It is very difficult to say if Boot to Gecko will challenge any of the OS projects from Google. Also in the already crowded market of OS platforms, I wonder if many mobile and tablet manufacturers will adopt the new OS.

What are your views on Mozilla’s new project? Should Mozilla be sticking to browsers and web apps instead of a new standalone OS? Do drop in your comments.
