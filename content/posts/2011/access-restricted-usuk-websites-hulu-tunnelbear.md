If youâ€™re trying to access restricted US/UK websites (or if you want to stay away from hackers), for example &#8211;Â <a href="http://www.hulu.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hulu.com/', 'Hulu']);" >Hulu</a>, TunnelBear can do the work for you. It&#8217;s not just about accessing restricted websites, it is also for people who like anonymity.

Sites with geographical restrictions are increasing, a recent example is Spotify. TunnelBear is the easiest VPN solution I have seen, here are its features.

  * TunnelBear is fast at switching the VPN on, compared to others.
  * If youâ€™re in India and want to access Hulu, then select *US* and turn on TunnelBear.

I know, 500 MB data per month is not sufficient for you. Donâ€™t worry, you can get an extra 1 GB data by tweeting about TunnelBear. All you have to do is, click on 1 GB promo on the app footer and then a window pops up in which you need to enter your twitter username and youâ€™re done. In a couple of minutes, the TunnelBear team will track your tweet and add the extra 1GB to your TunnelBear account (thatâ€™s why registration is needed ðŸ˜‰ ).

**Compatibility****:** Windows XP or higher and Mac.

Try out TunnelBear and give the feedback through comments.
