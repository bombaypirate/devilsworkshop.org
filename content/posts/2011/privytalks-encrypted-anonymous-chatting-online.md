Privacy is a big deal on the web, especially in recent times when social networks makes finding individuals very easy. Anonymity and encryption are two vital way to maintain your privacy. Also there are many instances when we want to not share our Gmail or Skype ID but use something temporary but what to discuss something with someone from a forum or a group.

With free online tool ***PrivyTalks***, we can chat anonymously and also have the exchanged information which is encrypted and hence safe.
