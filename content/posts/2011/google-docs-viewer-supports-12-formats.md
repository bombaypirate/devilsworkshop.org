Using the *Quick view* facility from Google Docs to view links on the Internet as well your email attachments without even downloading a local copy makes things so easy on the Internet. This saves time and securely let you view Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint presentations and PDF files. Google has now added support for 12 new file formats as below:

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW docsviewer1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-docsviewer1_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW docsviewer1" width="398" height="328" />][1]

## 12 New supported Extensions

  * MS PowerPoint (.PPTX)
  * MS Excel (.XLS and .XLSX)
  * XML Paper Specification (.XPS)
  * Adobe Photoshop (.PSD) *[wow! that’s real cool]*
  * AutoCad (.DXF) *[it will now be easy for engineers]*
  * Apple Pages (.PAGES)
  * Adobe Illustrator (.AI)
  * PostScript (.EPS, .PS)
  * Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)
  * TrueType (.TTF)

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW docsviewer2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-docsviewer2_thumb1.jpg" border="0" alt="DW docsviewer2" width="424" height="271" />][2]

In Gmail, now onwards when you receive an email, attachments with the new extensions will include a ‘view’ link. The similar behaviour will take place just like you view various PDFs over the web. Do post your comments on how Google really understands user needs and work towards that direction.
