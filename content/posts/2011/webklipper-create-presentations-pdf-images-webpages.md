Being a blogger means I often end up sharing online material with friends and colleagues. Images and webpage screenshots are the order of the day. Often I share with others with some remarks or questions. <a href="http://webklipper.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://webklipper.com', 'Webklipper']);" >Webklipper</a> is a website which allows creating online clips of **webpages**, **images **and even with **PDF files**. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a rel="attachment wp-att-36921" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/webklipper-create-presentations-pdf-images-webpages/webklipper_online_clips/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36921" title="webklipper_online_clips" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/webklipper_online_clips.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

I think this is a great tool to quickly put togeather a presentation along with your comments and share with others. People looking up the clip can also comment on it and leave their opinion. This is ideal if you are designing a new website or working on a document.

As you can see in the image above, we have the option of adding and looking up comments along with downloading original files. You can share the clip through a permalink, email, Twitter and Facebook.

So if you are a little bored sending emails to and fro about a presentation, try out <a href="http://webklipper.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://webklipper.com', 'Webklipper']);" ><strong>Webklipper</strong></a>. Do drop in your comments.

**Update: Webklipper **has recently also added extra features to the side bar which allow sharing content more easily thanks to more icons. It also has added features to show summary and expanded comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
