Yes, I did notice that <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/samsung-wave-533-rs-8500/" target="_blank">Samsung Wave 533</a> runs a BADA operating system and not the much hyped Android. Since I had personally no idea about this new OS ‚Äì ‚ÄúBADA‚Äù, I finally knocked Google and started looking for the differences with Android.

I am presenting a small compilation of thoughts after going through numerous articles and comments on BADA as well as Android.

## <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Display & Interface</span>

Bada is surely the winner over Android here with its TouchWiz UI. The interface is really very smooth and lets you move your widgets and icons easily between the 3 desktop screens, unlike Android which makes it slightly nudging experience.

## <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Multimedia</span>

Multimedia seems so cool with BADA as both its Audio and Video players are user-friendly and equipped with lots of functions while on the other hand Android Audio players is not really a good one to boast about. If we talk about the Wave 533 which has a Super AMOLED display, the video quality is just awesome!

## <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Apps Marketplace</span>

This is where BADA seems to lose against Android which already has the largest number of apps for its devices. However with Developers across the World gaining interest towards BADA App development, it is not far that BADA will be a big competitor to Android in the near future. Moreover unlike Google, Samsung takes pretty good care to keep junk applications out of its marketplace.

## <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span>

One possible reason no one is talking about BADA is because of the big image of Google attached to Android. While Samsung is not basically a Development company, Google is loved by billions of users around the globe. However BADA has basically taken the positive things from Android, iOS as well as HTC Sense, so let‚Äôs see how BADA evolves!
