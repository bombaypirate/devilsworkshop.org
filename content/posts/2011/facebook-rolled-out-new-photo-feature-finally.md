Facebook rolled out the Photo feature after a long wait. I got it today morning itself. Have a look.

Finally, Facebook rolled out the new photo feature about which we talked about, <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-working-on-4-new-features/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-working-on-4-new-features/', 'long back']);" >long back</a>. I don&#8217;t understand why did they delay it so much . <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We got the <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-messages-to-be-made-available-to-all/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-messages-to-be-made-available-to-all/', 'Facebook messages']);" >Facebook messages</a> also after long.

The new feature includes a black background, slider, and better resolution. When you see any new photographs on your Facebook wall uploaded by anyone and click it, the photo opens right there. So, you need not leave the main page to see the photographs. Wow!

Did you get the new feature ? Did you like it ? If you find any flaws in it let me know here. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
