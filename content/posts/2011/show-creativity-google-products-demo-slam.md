Creativity knows no bounds. We saw how [Apple&#8217;s popular gadgets are being used as instruments][1] for live performances on stage. One of my friend recently shared a nice website with me called “Google Demo Slam”. The website is  a showcase for users to upload their videos using any of the Google Technology in their general lives. The way it has been portrayed is a kind of a challenge as using Technology feels so nice but creating one needs guts!
