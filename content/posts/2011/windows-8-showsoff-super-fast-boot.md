Mine usually takes half a minute. I usually boot up my laptop twice a day on an average. That means I sit idle waiting for my computer to boot up for about 6 hours every year. That is why, recently a lot of stress is being put on faster boot up times.

The new Windows 8 OS from Windows is no exception, and recently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fast-boot-times-in-windows-8.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fast-boot-times-in-windows-8.aspx', 'demonstrated']);" >demonstrated</a> how the Windows 8 will load up faster than ever.

Here is a video of the new how fast Windows 8 starts up.



## Why Windows 8 will have faster boot-up times?

  * The key to a faster boot up lies in how the system shuts down. Windows 7, closes user profiles and then in kernel session it closes devices and services.
  * With Windows 8, the profiles will be closed but instead of closing down services it will put them in hibernate mode.
  * That means, certain services and their date will be stored on a local file “*hiberfil.sys*”. Thanks to this method, Windows 8 will have 30% to 70% faster boot up times.
  * With Windows 8, there will be an option to carry out cold-boot which means shutting down everything like Windows 7 does. This will be needed from time to time when adding new hardware.

It looks like Windows 8 will be a neat OS, but only when the first beta is available we will truly know. What are your views on Windows 8?
