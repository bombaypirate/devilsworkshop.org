Finally the day arrived, Mubarak resigned and people are rejoicing all over Egypt. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wael_Ghonim" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wael_Ghonim', 'Wael Ghonim']);" >Wael Ghonim</a> praises Facebook&#8217;s Zuckerberg for enabling the ousting of  Egypt&#8217;s Mubarak.

He says,

> I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg some day and thank him personally.

Well, this is what I call the power of social media. I wont say that it wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without Facebook, but the movement definitely gained momentum because of  social media.

Just have a look at <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Ghonim/status/36036754842591232" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/Ghonim/status/36036754842591232', 'Ghonim&#8217;s tweet']);" >Ghonim&#8217;s tweet</a>,

He is telling people that he won&#8217;t be giving any interviews instead he will use Facebook for everything. Wow, Mark Zuckerberg would be feeling a sense of pride being in this revolution. Though he wasn&#8217;t directly into it, but it was his Facebook, right ? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
