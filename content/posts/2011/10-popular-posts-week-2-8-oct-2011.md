This week was sombre for anyone who followed technology. Steve Jobs passed away on 5th October. I can only marvel at his impact, as so many young people who are self-employed or starting a business, have been suggesting Steve Jobs as an inspiration for so many years.

Hence it is no surprise that two posts on Steve Jobs, feature among the most popular this week.
