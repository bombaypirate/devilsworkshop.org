When I use my camera to take pictures, I often find that the images are far too large to be shared on social media websites. Most times I ended up resizing these images individually. Recently, I found a useful free software called **Photo Magician** which helps resize images in a batch within no time.

  * The software is a free and can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Digital-Photo-Tools/Photo-Magician.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Digital-Photo-Tools/Photo-Magician.shtml', 'Softpedia']);" >Softpedia</a>. Once you install the software simply add the folder which contain the photos that need resizing.
  * I could even specify which folder the resized images went into.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="Photo Magician" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/Resize_Image_Tools_PhotoMagician_thumb.png" alt="Resize_Image_Tools_PhotoMagician" width="570" height="404" border="0" />][1]

  * I found it very convenient that I could even set the default file-type, I wanted to convert my photos into.
  * I could choose to overwrite the original images or exclude certain images which were smaller in size.
  * Also another nice feature converting all the images into &#8216;Grey Scale&#8217; or &#8216;Rotate&#8217; them all in bulk.
  * Finally once the photos were converted, I could directly share them on Facebook or upload it to a FTP server from the software itself.

  I tried Photo Magician on Windows 7 and it does support XP and Vista too. Try it out and do drop in your comments.
