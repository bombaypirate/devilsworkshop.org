You might be aware of [Min.us a website which allows people to share photos and files online][1] without any need for an account. One reason I am a fan of <a href="http://min.us" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://min.us', 'Min.us']);" >Min.us</a> is because it also allows creating online image galleries and sharing them instantly. Flickr is a great website too but I like **Min.us** for its lightweight feel, quick and simple layout.

Most times I have photos stored on my desktop. I guess sometimes I am a little lazy to open a browser and open min.us to share files.

Min.us now has a desktop tool which allows simply dragging and dropping a file and sharing it on their website. It also shows you a URL where the file is stored and you can share with anyone.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-36709" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/share-photos-files-desktop/minus_desktop/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36709" title="Minus_desktop" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Minus_desktop.png" alt="Minus Desktop App" width="538" height="411" /></a>

  * Desktop app for Min.us is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux OS.
  * It is quite simple. All you do is drag and drop the file to the taskbar icon. Here you will see a Minus pop-up. Drop the image or file into the pop-up and it will display a URL for you where you can get access to the file online.
  * I could also check the history of all the files I uploaded to Min.us. This is a good idea because there desktop app did not show any option for accessing saved files with an account (while on the website we can get access to galleries by signing-up to an account).

If you are someone who keeps sharing images online with friends and family, <a href="http://min.us/pages/extras" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://min.us/pages/extras', 'Min.us Desktop']);" >Min.us Desktop</a> is more than useful. Do try it out and let me know your views through in comments.
