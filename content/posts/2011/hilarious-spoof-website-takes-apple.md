I bumped on to a shareable today which was a picture of an imaginary product that Apple Inc could possibly develop in the near future called **Water. ** ðŸ˜€

Here&#8217;s the picture for all you readers. Click to enlarge.

I read the line at the bottom of the picture as many of you might have, and went straight to scoopertino.com to check it out, and was not disappointed one little bit :D.

Scoopertino is one of the funniest fake news sites I&#8217;ve come across in a while. You&#8217;ll find tons of fake Apple news that would really make you laugh out loud!

Here&#8217;s another <a href="http://scoopertino.com/appleland-theme-park-draws-over-a-million-in-opening-week/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://scoopertino.com/appleland-theme-park-draws-over-a-million-in-opening-week/', 'article I read on Scoopertino']);" >article I read on Scoopertino</a> which claims that Apple recently opened a theme park for its fans which drew nearly a millionÂ visitorsÂ in the first week itself. ðŸ˜€

Here are some of the rides in the Apple theme park &#8211;

***&#8220;AAPLcoaster:** This high-tech roller coaster literally reconfigures itself second by second, mimicking Appleâ€™s stock performance in real time. Feel the adrenaline rush as your nest egg soars to new heights, plummets to the ground, then rockets skyward once again. (Not recommended for pregnant women or investors with heart conditions.)&#8221; *

*[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36873" title="DW scoop 2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-scoop-2-600x494.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="346" />][2]*

***&#8220;Android Attack!** Strap yourself into a sleek, weaponized, iPhone-style race car and put the pedal to the metal. Itâ€™s a life-or-death dash to the finish line with hundreds of vicious Androids nipping at your butt. Careful! For every Android you kill, two new ones take its place.&#8221;*

This website is a definite treat for all Apple fans as well Apple haters <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
