[<img class="wp-image-51012" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: right;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/slidemypics_thumb.png" alt="slidemypics" width="300" height="146" align="right" border="0" />][1]In today’s world where attention spans are less and having your photos shown in a quick slide-show is better as some people might not want to look at all the photos without a preview of sorts.

Slide-shows are a  great way to quickly present something on your blog website. With browsers adopting and encouraging the use of HTML5, creating HTML5 slideshows of your favourite photos from Facebook or Picasa seems like a useful idea.

***Slidemypics*** is a website which allows users to do just that.

## HTML5 Slideshows with <a href="http://www.slidemypics.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.slidemypics.com/', 'Slidemypics']);" >Slidemypics</a>

  * Visit the website and sign into your choice of social network where you have saved photos. It supports Flickr, Facebook, Picasa and SmugMug.

  * Add your album after you sign in and arrange the photos you want to be included in the slide-show. Users can change the order and also exclude some photos.
  * Users can then share these photos as a link on Twitter or Facebook. I really liked the idea of an embed code which can be used to add these photos on your website.
