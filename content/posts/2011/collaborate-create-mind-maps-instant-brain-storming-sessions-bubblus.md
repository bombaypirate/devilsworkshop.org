Brain storming sessions can be quite useful yet very unorganized. Great ideas are floated around but not all of them are executed or sometimes even remembered. This is where simple chart or mind-mapping tools are very useful.

These tools get even better when a full team can collaborate in the creation of such mind-maps.

  * Create an account and start creating your mind map. Invite others with an account to edit and add to the map you are creating.
  * If you only want to share a read only version, just share the URL of the map and share it with your friends via email.
  * We can also create a HTML-embed code to share it directly on your website/blog.

Do use ***Bubbl.us*** and drop in your comments.
