## What does **archivedbook** tells you?

  * View all messages on your status message that is you get to go to that status update and see the comments.
  * Date when you posted the status, how many likes did you receive and how many comments.
  * View all your old status messages since the day you made your Facebook account.

### How to use the &#8216;archivedbook&#8217; ?

  * Go to the website <a href="http://archivedbook.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://archivedbook.com/', 'archivedbook']);" >archivedbook</a> .
  * Click on connect.
  * You will be asked whether to allow the application.
  * Click on allow.
  * Once allowed it will take some seconds and show you the status updates.

Well, I liked going through all of them. Some were nice, some were bad, in short it was a nice walk through the status memory lane. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Do try out this app and let me know if you liked it.
