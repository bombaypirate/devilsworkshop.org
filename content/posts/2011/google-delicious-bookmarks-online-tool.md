Then came the denial and Yahoo declared, that it was only [going to sell Delicious][3] and not shut it down. Confusion reigned and most people who love delicious bookmarks (yours truly included) must be cursing the day Yahoo took it over.

Back in January I wrote about an online tool, which I thought was [the best way to move your bookmarks from Delicious to Google][4].

Today, Google released a new online tool as part of Google Bookmarks, which will allow Delicious bookmarks to be imported to Google.

## Why move to Google Bookmarks?

  * If you are Delicious user and are worried about its uncertain future. Then using <a href="https://www.google.com/bookmarks/deliciousimport" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/bookmarks/deliciousimport', 'this tool']);" >this tool</a>, to backup all your bookmarks to Google is a good idea.
  * It supports both Yahoo accounts as well as old Delicious accounts. All the tags from Delicious are converted into labels for Google Bookmarks.

This will help Google a lot, because they have fallen behind when it comes to online bookmarking. This mainly being due to the fact, that Delicious had already cornered the market there. Online bookmarks are actually a good indicator for showing what people really value on the net compared to the links shared on Facebook and Twitter.

Will you be using Google Bookmarks? Do drop in your comments.
