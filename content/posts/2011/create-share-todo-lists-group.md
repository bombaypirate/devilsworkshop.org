Coordinating on a college project or even planning a vacation, can be very tedious. This is because different people do different things and I am sure, no one wants to buy an expensive ticketing software for planning a trip with friends and family. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

***<a href="http://www.todofeed.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.todofeed.com', 'TodoFeed']);" >TodoFeed</a>*** is a free online tool, that allows you to create a list of things that need to be done and add people via email so they can pick up tasks and complete them.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="todoFeed" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/todoFeed_thumb.png" alt="todoFeed" width="570" height="370" border="0" />][1]

  * The website does need creating an account with your email address. I could add my friends via their email address.
  * Also you can create multiple projects and add tasks into them. Other can also add tasks into your list which is ideal for a collaborative work.
  * The task list makes it a lot easier to manage a project along with friends. Why they complete a task, they can simply click on the ‘***I’ll take care of it***” button.

This might not be useful for serious work projects, but seems to be ideal for planning small collaborative projects.

I found this a more useful than [Fish Memory online tool][2], which also allows creating to-do lists and sharing them with friends.

Try out ***TODOFeed*** along with a few friends and let me know through your comments.
