Email reminders are important and sometimes it is useful to send yourself reminders for birthdays, anniversaries and other important date. For an email addict like me, I am always interested in something new with email.

**<a href="http://emailfuture.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://emailfuture.com', 'EmailFuture']);" >EmailFuture</a>** allows sending emails in the future, to upto 10 years or even a few months in the future.

I could also send the email as a public message. This sends the email with a link as reminder for your message. The link shows the message being shown publicly.

If you like setting email reminders in the future, you might want to read up on [Nudge Mail][3] and how to [schedule emails in the future with Gmail][4].

Try out Email Future and drop in your comments.
