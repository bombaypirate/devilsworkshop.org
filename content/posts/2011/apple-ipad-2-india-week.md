Apple iPad 2 was not really expected to hit stores in India for a while considering the first version of iPad were released in India only in February 2011.

Now atleast one vendor Vijay Sales has confirmed that it does have the iPad 2 tablet available through a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/VijaySales/status/62947739725606912" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/VijaySales/status/62947739725606912', 'tweet']);" target="_blank">tweet</a>.

Thinner, Lighter, Faster&#8230;The <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23ipad2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23ipad2', '#ipad2']);" title="#ipad2" rel="nofollow">#ipad2</a> Now available at<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23VijaySales" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23VijaySales', '#VijaySales']);" title="#VijaySales" rel="nofollow">#VijaySales</a> store near you. Go Grab It!!!

The price was not confirmed by Vijay Sales online and would be only revealed at the store, but it is probably **Rs. 27,900/-** onwards.

## Why so early in India?

I think Apple had probably miscalculated the market demand in India for iPad devices. Possibly after iPad sales in India took off, Apple realized that there is a healthy demand for tablets in India but consumers might go for other tablets instead of wait for iPad 2.

This might have fast tracked Apple into making these tablets available in countries like India, earlier than previously planned.

Do drop in your comments.
