Commerce through Social media is about to rise by 6 time till 2015. This is a latest research done on Facebook commerce.

A report from Booz & Company states that,

> 7 percent of respondents would purchase physical goods through Facebook or other social media. Ten percent said such shopping would be in addition to purchases already planned to occur via other media.

The consultancy talked to consumers who spend at least one hour a month on social media sites and who have purchased something online at least once over the past year. However, the 73 percent that said they wouldn’t buy physical items through social media sites said concerns about security and privacy deter them from this form of shopping.

Booz recommends that companies focus on converting fans to buyers, or turning “likes” to “buys,”. This can be a good way to increase their popularity, I must say!

What do you think ? I have never done shopping through Facebook though I wish to do some day. Generally I am afraid of the credit card and all. What is your experience with such shopping ? What attracts you to do e shopping through Facebook ?
