[<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42451" title="Microsoft_Gmail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/Microsoft_Gmail-200x200.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" />][1]Yesterday, I wrote a post on how [Gmail was hinting that email services like Hotmail were old-fashioned][2]. Microsoft not to be outdone, has also poked fun at Gmail. The point it makes is that Gmail scans through your email contents, which is comparable to the mailman looking through your letters.

According to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-latest-google-compete-weapon-the-gmail-man/10217" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-latest-google-compete-weapon-the-gmail-man/10217', 'ZDNet']);" >ZDNet</a>, the leaked video was shown at the Microsoft Global Exchange conference. The clip made it out and Microsoft has not confirmed nor denied that they were involved in the clip spoofing Gmail.

The spoof, points towards Gmail and suggests it has no regard for user privacy with the quote “Your email is your business, Gmail makes it theirs”



### Difference between the two ads

Gmail points not to their rivals lack of features but showcase their own features which are impressive. They suggest AOL, Hotmail and Yahoo are old-fashioned but it did not really attack these services, keeping the focus on its superior features.

Microsoft has interestingly, attacked the “don&#8217;t be evil” motto of Google, suggesting that Google has no regard for privacy.

In the end the service which is intuitive and makes email usage easy, will come out the winner. At the moment for me that service is Gmail.
