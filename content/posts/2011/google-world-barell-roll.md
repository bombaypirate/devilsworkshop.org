## What does &#8216;Do a Barell Roll&#8221; mean?

This has been inspired from a Nintendo video game called &#8216;Star Fox&#8217;. The game was hugely popular in the mid-1990s and Google seems to be paying it own homage to the game. The &#8216;barell roll&#8217; was a¬†manoeuvre¬†in the game.

Google employees seem to be¬†huge gaming fans, as it had over two years ago given a [homage to the game &#8216;Zero Wing&#8217; with a strangely coded Tweet][1].
