I came across this infographic chart this morning, so thought of sharing it with you all. Have a look at the image below.

According to this image, in 2010:

->There were 7.9 new registrations per 1 second on Facebook.

->Coca Cola had maximum number of fans on Facebook among products.

->26.2 M people followed Michael Jackson on Facebook.

Pretty nice numbers, what do you think ? Facebook is gaining popularity everyday. 7.9 registrations per second is a big thing.

Share your views with me.
