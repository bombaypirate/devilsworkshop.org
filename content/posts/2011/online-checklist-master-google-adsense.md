  There are many blogs and forums which might give a lot of detailed information and help on AdSense, it is still a little daunting for people using AdSense for the first time.
  Probably with that in mind, Google has launched a online tool called AdSense Academy

For most Blogs which make money, Google AdSense plays an important role. AdSense often is the biggest earner for a blog and not to forget it also is a big earner for Google.

There are many blogs and forums which might give a lot of detailed information and help on AdSense, it is still a little daunting for people using AdSense for the first time.

Probably with that in mind, Google has <a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/2011/10/test-your-knowledge-with-adsense.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://adsense.blogspot.com/2011/10/test-your-knowledge-with-adsense.html', 'launched']);" >launched</a> an online tool called AdSense Academy which allows people to master all facets of AdSense.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Google AdSense Checklist" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/Google_adsense_Acadaemy_thumb.png" alt="Google_adsense_Acadaemy" width="570" height="349" border="0" />][1]

## Features of <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/as/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=checklist.cs&tab=1187443" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/as/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=checklist.cs&tab=1187443', 'Google AdSense Academy']);" >Google AdSense Academy</a>

  * The online checklist can be accessed from here. The best part is we do not need to have an AdSense account before trying it out.
  * It has a detailed checklist from how to create your first ad unit, ad format and identifying where the [ad should be placed][2].
  * Users can also take a quiz to actually complete a milestone like someone would in a training course at an academy. This will allow users to learn all the basics of AdSense.

I found the checklist very useful for people who are new to AdSense. It might also be a great help to AdSense pros to sharpen their knowledge and keep themselves updated.
