We still have time for the launch of Apple&#8217;s next iPhone that is iPhone 4S but we have some leaked official information that we got from Apple&#8217;s Japan website. The website already started showing that the iPhone will be available from 8:00 a.m on October 14th 2011. But there&#8217;s no other information about the phone and we have to wait for the event to start to know it&#8217;s features.

The problem is that the website is in Japanese so date is the only information we got. You can check out their Japanese website <a href="http://www.apple.com/jp/retail/ginza/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/jp/retail/ginza/', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>. Hopefully it will be launched in India soon but the Indian Apple Store&#8217;s website is still up and they are not updating it. Let&#8217;s wait for the event to start. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
