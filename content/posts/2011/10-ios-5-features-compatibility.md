  4. **Reminders:** A small thing with a huge update. You can completely add your to-do list to your reminder even with a location to it. Reminder will automatically remind you that you have to do this particular work in that area.
  5. **Twitter:** Twitter is now a part of Apple&#8217;s new Operating System. All you have to do is sign in once and start sharing stuff like photos, videos or location with maps.
  6. **Camera:** Some new features like pinch to zoom, new button on lock screen and press Vol+ button to capture.
  7. **Photos:** More photoshopping options like Cropping, Rotating or even removing Red-Eye in your pictures.
  8. **Safari:** New Reading List and Tabbed Browsing like we have in Firefox. Also you can tap to read an article without ads like obstructions.
