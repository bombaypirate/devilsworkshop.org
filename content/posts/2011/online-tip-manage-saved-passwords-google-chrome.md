Chrome has some nice built-in features to save passwords for websites you might be visiting regularly.¬†Most people who use Chrome extensively might be aware that the browser can save passwords, but many are unaware we can manage those passwords or individually delete only certain passwords.

Many times we want to delete some of these passwords and but not all of them. For example banking websites or other websites which you do not visit anymore.
