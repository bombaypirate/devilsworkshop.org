A few days ago, Aditya covered [5 advantages Google+ has over Facebook][1]. Last week during the unfortunate serial bomb blasts in Mumbai, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112797670385306702141/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/112797670385306702141/', 'Pratik Parekh']);" title="Pratik Parekh on Google+">Pratik Parekh</a>Â pointed out to another advantage Google+ has over Facebook. This advantage is in link-sharing feature present on both sites.

If you followed social-media after Mumbai Blast closely, then you might have come across Wikipedia article links to Ajmal Kasab&#8217;s page being shared all over. SomeÂ miscreantÂ had modified Kasab&#8217;s date of birth on his wiki page making it 13th July&#8217;s which was the day the serial blasts took place in Mumbai.

Like many people, I fell for falsehood and shared the wiki-link over Facebook as well as Google+ at the same time. After few hours, when the error on Wikipedia was resolved, Google+ shared link preview showed corrected date of birth while Facebook link-preview still showed the wrong date of birth.

**Google+ Link Cache**

### Is this a big deal?

No. Not at all IMHO. But it certainly shows the care with which Google+ has been designed! ðŸ˜‰
