Earlier Facebook had two tabs separately for info and about. Today Facebook reconciled these two into one.

What do you think ? Will this make Facebook pages clutter free ? I kind of like this. There wasn&#8217;t any use of keeping two tabs, one will be more than enough. Instead, &#8216;about&#8217; comes on the left hand side of the Facebook page.

What was creating problem is that when we tried to edit one tab then both got updated. Info and About were creating a nuisance, no more! What do you think ? Observe these and let me know.
