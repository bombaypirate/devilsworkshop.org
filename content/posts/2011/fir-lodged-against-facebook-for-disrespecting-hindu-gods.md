A FIR was filed in Meerut against the social networking website by a social activist saying that a Facebook profile disrespect Indian gods with an image of the deities titled &#8221;3 idiots&#8217;.

This is bad. This is not acceptable no matter what the reason may be. This profile says,

> Delete all Isl?mic pages, I swear I&#8217;ll delete this one. Else be prepared I have 100 more pages like this.

This is just the war of religions. But like this ? The FIR cites section 66 A of the Information Technology Act 2000, and expresses fears about the profile causing riots all over India.

An eye for an eye solves nothing ! Shameful I must say ! Express your thought about this with me.
