The Microsoft Bing search engine will soon integrate &#8216;**Facebook Likes**&#8216; more prominently into its search results. Wow.

<a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2010/10/13/facebook-instant-personalization-comes-to-bing-web-and-people-search/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.insidefacebook.com/2010/10/13/facebook-instant-personalization-comes-to-bing-web-and-people-search/', 'Bing added Facebook Instant Personalization']);" >Bing added Facebook Instant Personalization</a> and began showing Liked results at the bottom of result pages in October. Well, now when you search for something, your friend&#8217;s name will appear below the search result.

According to the <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/24/bing-expands-facebook-liked-results.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/24/bing-expands-facebook-liked-results.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0', 'Bing blog']);" >Bing blog</a>, they will be showing results with Facebook user&#8217;s name etc. They said,

> You may not see Liked Results on every query, but when it does trigger it&#8217;s often a delightful experience. We are hoping that it will make searching on Bing more effortless and enjoyable. We are continuing to work with Facebook to make search more social and relevant.
