The story of Steve Jobs is almost cinematic. It is a long running saga of innovation, failures and one famous comeback to see almost unknown success, along with fighting cancer.

Today, Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-Apple.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-Apple.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that Steve Jobs their iconic leader is quitting the post of CEO. While their current COO – Tim Cook will become the new CEO. Steve Jobs will be involved with Apple as he is the new Chairman of the Board for Apple.

It marks is the end of Steve Jobs running Apple, on a day-to-day basis. For many techies, Steve Jobs as a brand is actually bigger than the brand value of Apple. His famous “*and one more thing*” quote and then presenting something completely new was a huge hit with Apple fans. Expectations were set higher and higher with Apple fans.

Surprisingly he kept meeting those expectations. The cult of Steve Jobs, got bigger with his famous speech at Stanford where he said [“Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish”][2]

He had founded Apple and got fired. He returned to Apple many years later. Jobs was probably a lot wiser than his earlier years with Apple and a strategic decision of not trying to beat Windows was made.

Then came the iPod, the iPhone and now the iPad. The company that was primarily a computer maker, ended up with a MP3 players and smart-phone as their most profitable businesses.

As he quits Apple as CEO, [Apple has bigger profits than Microsoft][3] along with being one of the most valued tech company. It will be interesting to see how Apple will deal with their most iconic CEO ever.
