Yahoo, over the last few months is getting a lot of negative vibes from the tech community. This is because Yahoo had decided to [close down Delicious][1], the popular bookmarking service. Yahoo has [seen its fortune falling over the last decade][2] and it has a list of companies, which it bought for hundreds of millions of dollars and ended up short-selling them or closing them down. There was enough anger over Yahoo’s decision to close down Delicious until [Yahoo announced it was selling Delicious][3].

Now according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-selling-delicious-2011-3?op=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-selling-delicious-2011-3?op=1', 'Business Insider']);" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>, Yahoo has apparently found a buyer for Delicious. The price of the deal is rumoured to be about $1 &#8211; 2 million.

## Why Yahoo might be selling Delicious for such a low price!

  * Yahoo paid something close to $15 –30 Million for Delicious. If they are selling it for one or two million, they might as well have sold it free! This also means, Yahoo might not have a planned strategy to sell Delicious for a high price.
  * Delicious is used a lot by many people to share bookmarks. Delicious is usually not valuable from traffic point of view, but it has high reputation.
  * Also, absent in Delicious is a revenue model. This means Delicious practically makes no money. Yahoo might be under pressure to get rid of a service which is not making any money.

In the meanwhile, if you are looking to move or backup your Delicious Bookmarks somewhere else, you might be interested in [Google Bookmarks migration tool][5].
