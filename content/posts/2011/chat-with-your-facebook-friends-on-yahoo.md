Now you can chat with your Facebook friends on Yahoo. When it comes to checking emails we rely on Gmail or Yahoo and when it comes to chatting and making friends we are in love with Facebook. So here is the greatest combination ever, check mails on Yahoo and chat with your Facebook friends.

Almost a year ago, Yahoo started allowing the ability to update the status on Facebook using Yahoo mail. But, this is much better! On left hand side you can see your Facebook contacts and chat with them when you wish to.

How has been your experience with Yahoo Facebook chat ? Share your view with me.
