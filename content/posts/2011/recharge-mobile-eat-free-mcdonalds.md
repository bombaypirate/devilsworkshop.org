excerpt: I hope all of you carry a mobile phone and most are Pre-paid ones (though I carry a Post-paid too! ). Recharging of cell phones is now an important part of our daily lives and no one would like their available talktime showing zero. Owing to this and with increasing Internet usability, lot of companies started their Online recharge facility quite early and that too without any extra charges. However the website I am talking about here gives back their users when they recharge for any amount; seems interesting? Read on to know more.

> **Editor&#8217;s Note:** Currently McDonald’s, Voucher is removed from freecharge.in and hence is not available.

I hope all of you carry a mobile phone and most are Pre-paid ones (though I carry a Post-paid too! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). Recharging of cell phones is now an important part of our daily lives and no one would like their available talktime showing zero.

However the website I am talking about here gives back their users when they recharge for any amount; seems interesting? Read on to know more.

Freecharge a Mumbai-based firm, is offering one of the latest innovations in the mobile commercial world. It is offering an equal amount of Vouchers or coupons for brands like McDonald&#8217;s, Cafe Coffee Day, Naaptol, Dominos, Basking Robbins, Yatra and few more like this for the amount you recharge through the portal.

Yes, this is quite funny that even in this electronic world they are sending vouchers through normal post only.

I would quote an example from my experience. I recharged my Reliance GSM mobile for Rs. 109 (since I get a full talktime on that) and I was asked to select coupons worth upto Rs. 150, so I selected 3 coupons worth Rs. 50 each of McDonald&#8217;s. The reason I selected McDonald&#8217;s and nothing else was that McDonald&#8217;s vouchers are redeemable on the equal bill value itself which means if my bill is Rs.150, I can use all my vouchers worth Rs. 150 (Rs. 50 x 3) to have anything and pay actually nothing! Isn’t that cool?

***Note**: Rs. 10 extra charges (irrespective of your recharge amount) for delivery of the vouchers to your place.*

You can recharge for almost every cell phone carrier like Reliance CDMA & GSM, Vodafone, Aircel etc and get set go. Please do comment on how much useful this website is going to be for you!
