Did you ever feel the need to ask your friends and colleagues about their opinion on some product?

**Real-life Example:**

Suppose if you are looking to buy a new Smartphone!

**My Case:**

I was looking for a new smartphone for myself and faced with tremendous confusion..

**The Process:**

I consulted many of my friends for their opinion on certain brands and models.

**The Result:**

The pattern I used to collect their opinion was somewhat haphazard. I ended up in an opinion-bin with lots of random opinion.

**The Solution:**

One of my friend’s always keep saying, there is nothing you can’t find on Google! Yeah, he proved right even this time, I searched and found the website “SurveyMonkey.com” which lets you create surveys for free and post them directly to your friend lists on Gmail, Yahoo, Facebook and other social networking websites.

## **All about SurveyMonkey**

  * The website is all about doing Market Research in a formatted and organized way with even input data being validated.

  * Chose what kind of answer you are expecting by selecting the type of question.

  * One feature I must share is the question Logic which can be added to any question. The question Logic saves time by not asking questions which are not necessary. For example – If there is a market research on Nokia E5, ofcourse you would be looking for specific opinion from people who have actually used the mobile phone and not just from every passer-by. So if there is a question which asks “Did you use or presently use Nokia E5?”; for people who answer ‘Yes’ would be asked further specific questions or else the general questions would follow and finally the survey would end.

  * Safety of your data is guaranteed by SurveyMonkey which holds the US Federal Law Section 508 compliance certification.  Data is carefully kept and is available in a PDF format also.
  * Generate charts, prepare real-time reports using the Survey results and even share them with your friends.
  * Now what? Do you want Survey Monkey to even write the questions for you? Obviously it can’t, but it can definitely help with the available Question templates. Howz that?
