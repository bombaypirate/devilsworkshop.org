To get a Degree from American or European Universities, you need to take relevant exams such as the **GRE**, **TOEFL**, **IELTS** etc. There is a lot of material available online which could help you to prepare for these competitive exams.

Here I’m going to write about 5 such websites, which would help you to prepare as well as send your applications, select Universities to apply to, guide you with the Visa interviews and also help you with the preparation for departure to the desired country!

### **#1. <a href="http://edulix.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://edulix.com', 'Edulix']);" >Edulix</a>**

**Edulix** is a large forum where you can find different sub-forums to directly get help from students who have already given the GRE or TOEFL or any other exam. You can ask them for resources, online dictionaries, wordlists or practice tests.

Edulix is a massive community of students, who share their experiences with you about their applications, admission status, Visa interviews etc.  After you are done with the GRE and TOEFL, you can post your profile in the** Profile Evaluation forum, **with a list of your desired universities. The moderators then reply to your post, by telling you your chances at those universities.

    One good feature that I liked about Uniguru is that you can read reviews of students who have been studying at a particular University.
