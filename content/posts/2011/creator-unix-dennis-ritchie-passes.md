Dennis Ritchie passed away after a long illness. He was 70 years old.

Dennis Ritchie, created C Language. He worked with AT&T Bell Labs in the early development part of the language.

Ritchie also before his creation of C language, had also teamed up with Ken Thompson to create the UNIX operating system.

Even though I am not a programmer, but I can understand the vast impact of C programming language.

Today, C is the second-most used programming language and led to development of newer languages like C++.

There is no doubt that the world has lost one of the most iconic name in the software programming.
