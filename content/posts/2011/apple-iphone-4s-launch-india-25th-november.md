We should be able to see iPhone 4S very soon in India. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=300814226608870&set=a.161184937238467.36727.147351511955143&type=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=300814226608870&set=a.161184937238467.36727.147351511955143&type=1', 'Airtel']);" >Airtel</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aircel/posts/199391396802594" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/aircel/posts/199391396802594', 'Aircel']);" >Aircel</a> have announced on their respective Facebook pages that, that the iPhone 4s will soon be available.

At the moment, the date of this launch is not confirmed but is rumored to be on 24th November 2011. According to <a href="http://www.bgr.in/2011/11/11/aircel-announces-iphone-4s-for-india/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bgr.in/2011/11/11/aircel-announces-iphone-4s-for-india/', 'BGR']);" >BGR</a>, the price of iPhone 4S in India will be Rs 40,000 for the 16GB model and Rs. 50,000 for the 64 GB version.

The prices are extraordinarily high and iPhone 4S might not be as well received as its predecessor in India.

### Will Apple iPhone 4S price itself out of the market?

If the prices are closer to Rs. 40,000 then chances of it being a big hit in the market are low. It might though grab high-end users from BlackBerry, whose reputation did suffer after a [three-day downtime for its messaging services][1]. Also I guess high-end users might be more tempted with features like Siri.

These are exciting times for India&#8217;s smart phone market with Google also rolling out [registration for Galaxy Nexus][2].
