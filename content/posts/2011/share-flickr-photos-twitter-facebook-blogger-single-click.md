Flickr has added some new sharing features to enable users to share images on various other social and publishing services. Now with a single click a photo from your Flickr account can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Blogger and even WordPress. A notable absence can be Google Buzz but then who really uses Buzz? ðŸ˜›

  * Earlier the photos could be shared only via email.
  * An interesting but critical addition for the new sharing features on Flickr is how it also allows sharing photos to Blogger and WordPress blogging platforms.
  * It has correctly identified that blogging platforms will only add to Flickrâ€™s visibility if allowed to share images.
  * Initially we could share photos from <a href="http://fbknol.com/share-flickr-photos-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/share-flickr-photos-on-facebook/', 'Flickr to Facebook by synchronizing them']);" >Flickr to Facebook by synchronizing them</a>.

I still think Flickr has got this very basic feature quite late in the day. Is this because a general lack of innovation? Over the last two years, I cannot think of anything cool regarding features when it comes to Flickr.

If you do use Flickr a lot, do check out these new sharing options and drop in your comments.
