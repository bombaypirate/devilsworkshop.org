Twitter users can use HTTPS by just adding it to the address bar. But this is a little troublesome and we have to do this every time we visit Twitter.

Twitter has now introduced an option which lets you open Twitter in HTTPS by default.

## How to enable HTTPS on Twitter!

  * Sign into your Twitter account on Twitter.com.
  * On the top right, select the drop down menu which is with your username. This drop-down menu has link to settings. Click on it.
  * By default you will be at Account section of the Settings. Here scroll down to the end and select ‘HTTPS Only’.
  * Click on Save, and enjoy secure browsing of your Twitter account.

### Why is HTTPS useful?

Usually when we use unsecured Wi-fi networks for browsing there is a chance that, someone can snoop at your browsing activity. To avoid this we use HTTPS instead of HTTP. Most services will not offer HTTPS browsing because it does take a bit of load on their servers to provide secure browsing options.

Most people might be using Twitter on unsecured Wi-fi networks, as most people tend to tweet on the go. This makes the HTTPS option a handy one. Do drop in your comments.
