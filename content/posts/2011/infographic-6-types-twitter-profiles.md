I was not really into Twitter before I became a blogger. Even as a blogger I try to tweet only useful things. One problem is who should I follow and who I should not. People are very different on Facebook compared to Twitter. Twitter users can spam, complain or simply write update mundane things like they are having a hot coffee or watching the clouds outside.

This infographic might give you a good idea about the different types of Twitter profiles that are around. (Click on image to get maximized version)

I found this quite funny but true. The infographic gives good advice on what kind of accounts we should try to understand, observe, tolerate, block, follow and even adore. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So if you have a Twitter account which one are you? Do drop in your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
