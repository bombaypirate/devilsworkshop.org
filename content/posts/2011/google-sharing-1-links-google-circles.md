Google introduced its +1 button long before Google+ was unleashed to the world. With Google+, the +1 button made sense. It was now more or less a counterpart of Facebook’s “Like” button.

Google has announced a new feature called +Snippets, with which Google+ users can share snippets of the link with their Google+ Circles.

[<img class="wp-image-51296" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/08/Google_PLus_snippets_share_thumb.png" alt="Google_PLus_snippets_share" width="570" height="414" border="0" />][1]

As you can see in the image above, soon people will be able to start sharing on Google+, a link which they recommend using the +1 button. The big advantage over Facebook’s ‘Like’ feature is that the person sharing the link does not need to visit a pop-up page and all the sharing , adding comments, managing which circle can view the link is done without ever leaving the page. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This will in effect integrate +1 with Google+ completely, thus allowing the Google+ social network to make sharing links a lot more easier.

This feature is not available for everyone now, but you can start using it by registering <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/platform-preview/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/platform-preview/', 'here']);" title="Google+ Platform Preview">here</a>.

This is a new addition by Google on Google+ and follows the popular [‘Games’ feature on Google+][2]. What are your views on sharing +1 Snippets on Google+ Circles? Do drop in your comments.
