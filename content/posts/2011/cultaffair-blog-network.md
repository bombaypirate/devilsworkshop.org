Our (rtBlogs Network) journey into blogging started on this blog which was more or less a Tech blog. Devils Workshop grew steadily and got us working on creating a blog network. Then we launched Orkut Diary, Fbknol, WpVeda and CricTalks which gave us a wider scope. Today we have added another blog to our network. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

We launched <a href="http://cultaffair.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cultaffair.com', 'CultAffair']);" >CultAffair</a> on our network on 25th December 2010.

CultAffair is a blog that will cover the street. Often in our everyday life, we find many ordinary things on the roads and streets corners. There is a hidden world which we often ignore simply because we do not have the time to stop and look. CultAffair will try to do that and bring to you through its posts that &#8220;Ordinary is not Boring&#8221;.

This blog is the brainchild of [Shradha Rao][1] and you might be familiar with her posts on DW if you are a regular here.
