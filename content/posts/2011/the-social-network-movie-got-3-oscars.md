The Oscars 2011 winners have been announced ! The movie Social Network got 3 Oscars. Ah, a bit bad. I was expecting more.

The movie which was nominated for <a href="http://fbknol.com/the-social-network-gets-8-nominations-at-oscars-2011/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/the-social-network-gets-8-nominations-at-oscars-2011/', '8 Oscars']);" >8 Oscars</a> has finally bagged 3 out of 8 awards. Well, if it would have got at least half of what was nominated, I would have been happier.
