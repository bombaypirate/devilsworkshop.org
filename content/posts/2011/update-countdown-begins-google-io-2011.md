The main subject of Google I/O 2011 will be about the “cloud”. It will even feature the latest Google technology and products such as <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/android-overtook-symbian-sales/" target="_blank">Android which recently grabbed its leadership officially</a> in the mobile segment, Google Chrome and other applications. Participants shall even get opportunities to meet the entire Google team, there will be rounds of technical sessions and a lot more.
