excerpt: I just received the Electricity Bill for my apartment this month and it was a considerably high amount than what it used to be. I immediately checked the “Units consumed” section on the bill and I could not understand that number’s history. So I decided to see online if there is any tool available to calculate my Monthly units consumption in units, as usually all such calculators display the consumption in KWh and writes a line at the bottom of the page – “Find out the per KWh cost from your local Electricity company". Now if we had to do all that, why will we be looking for information on the Internet.

I just received the Electricity Bill for my apartment this month and it was a considerably high amount than what it used to be. I immediately checked the “Units consumed” section on the bill and I could not understand that number’s history. So I decided to see online if there is any tool available to calculate my Monthly units consumption in **units**, as usually all such calculators display the consumption in kWh and writes a line at the bottom of the page – “Find out the per kWh cost from your local Electricity company&#8221;. Now if we had to do all that, why will we be looking for information on the Internet.

I found out a Bill Calculator today which is available to calculate the Electricity consumption in Units. The calculator takes inputs in 6 pages as follows:

## Page #1

  * Bulb – 4 categories of Power rating to select from viz. 25, 40, 60 and 100 Watts
  * Tubelight – standard Power rating is considered
  * CFL – 2 categories of Power rating to select from i.e. 8 and 9 Watts

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW elec2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-elec2_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW elec2" width="337" height="352" />][2]

## Page #2

  * Fan – 2 categories of Fan diameter is available to select from, 36” and 48”
  * Table Fan – standard Power rating of 40 Watts

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW elec3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-elec3_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW elec3" width="345" height="268" />][3]

## Page #3

  * Iron – 2 categories of power rating: 550 Watts and 750 Watts
  * Geyser – Generally known for high power rating and hence three categories available to select, 2000 Watts, 3000 Watts and 6000 Watts.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW elec4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-elec4_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW elec4" width="357" height="272" />][4]

## Page #4

  * Air Conditioner – Capacity-based categories like 1 and 1.5 Tons
  * Refrigerator – The usage has been assumed and kept fixed at 12 hours a day, however you have to select between 155 Litres or 300 Litres capacity
  * Washing Machine – No power rating or consumption duration mentioned

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW elec5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-elec5_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW elec5" width="365" height="376" />][5]

## Page #5

  * Oven – Power rating options are 3000 Watts and 5000 Watts
  * Toaster – I didn’t know that a small-sized toaster could have a 1000 Watt rating
  * Mixer – A power rating is fixed at 200 Watts
  * Cooker – Power rating mentioned as 1500 Watts. Don’t confuse it with the traditional Gas cookers.
  * Cooking range – Gosh! A Cooking range has such a high Power rating of 5000 Watts.

## Page #6

  * Radio – Radio has a low power rating of just 50 Watts
  * Television – It has a fixed power rating of just 150 Watts
  * Tape Recorder – Though replaced with MP3 players and Home Theatres, Tape Recorder is mentioned with a power rating of 50 Watts.
  * Computer – And finally the thing we all use the most, the Computer has been taken with a fixed power rating

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW elec7" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-elec7_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW elec7" width="335" height="443" />][7]

## The Result Page!

So now after long list of specifications and selections, we get our result in Units per month. I can even give you a tip to calculate your bill using the data from your last received bill. In the last bill, just see the section where you Usage charges are mentioned. Don’t combine the Fixed and other charges. Divide this amount (usage charges) with the number of units in the then bill and you can have a general idea about the per unit charges prevalent in your area.

Do post your comments if you know of any other online calculator for Electricity consumption, find something relevant to India and even put your suggestions whether such topics are of any interest to you. I would be glad to hear from you all.
