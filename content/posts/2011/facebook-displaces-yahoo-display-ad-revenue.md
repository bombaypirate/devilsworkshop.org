This is a shocking news as its displacing Yahoo from its position, which was number one since long. Further more,Â David Hallerman, eMarketer principal analyst, estimates that display ad revenue for the social network will rise 80.9% to $2.19 billion this year.

Well, I do know this for sure. My friend used Facebook Ads for marketing his blog and got a good traffic. I guess the future of Facebook ads is great. Have you tried it ? Let me know through your comments.
