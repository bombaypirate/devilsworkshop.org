Many websites when launched use countdown timers. This timer usually tells you the time in days, hours, minutes and seconds, that it will take for the website to go live. If you are new to blogging or want a quick count down timer to be embedded in your website then Countdown Calendar will be quite helpful.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="CountdownCalendar" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/CountdownCalendar_thumb.png" border="0" alt="CountdownCalendar" width="304" height="304" />][1]

  * I could customize the width of the timer along with background colour.
  * Another customization is selecting down to a time and date which the clock carries out a countdown. I could customized most elements including the image that goes with the timer.
  * The only thing that I did not like was that I could not customize the font. This might be a problem but as we get the HTML code for embedding the timer in out website, we can tweak this code to customized the font if needed.

In the case you are looking to embed a quite timer which countdowns to a website launch or even your birthday, try out Countdown Calendar. Do drop in your comments.
