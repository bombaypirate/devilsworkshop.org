Google Plus has sparked off a good number of third-party extensions and online apps. As more and more people adopt Google+, we might find it a little over-whelming to follow many public profiles. A good idea would be to have a RSS feed of that particular Google+ profile, so we can easily follow it via Google Reader or other RSS Readers.

In came to know in a <a href="http://www.nirmaltv.com/2011/07/14/how-to-create-an-rss-feed-for-a-google-profile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nirmaltv.com/2011/07/14/how-to-create-an-rss-feed-for-a-google-profile/', 'blog post']);" >blog post</a>, about*** plusfeed.appspot*** which allows creating RSS of Google+ profiles.

### Creating RSS Feeds of Google+ Profiles

  * First look up the Google+ profile you are looking to visit. Every profile has a unique ID number which is also part of the profile’s URL.
  * Just copy that number as shown in the image below. I decided to follow Larry Page (Founder and CEO of Google) on Google+.

  * Now append that number to ***plusfeed.appspot.com/ ***so it looks something like ***plusfeed.appspot.com/106189723444098348646.***
  * This will create a RSS feed of the page, all that is left to do is to add the URL into your Google Reader and you get a feed of the Google+ profile’s posts.

This way we can keep track of all posts of profiles which share a lot of public updates with our Google Reader. You might also want to look-up an easier way to [remember the URL of your Google+ profile][3] or a [chrome extension to move your Facebook albums to Google+][4].
