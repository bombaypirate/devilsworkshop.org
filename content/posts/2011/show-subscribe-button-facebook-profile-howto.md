Showing only &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; button on your Facebook profile is like a twitter account where one can follow you but it&#8217;s not necessary to follow them back. This function is useful is you&#8217;re getting too many friend requests on Facebook but don&#8217;t want to get connected to all but share some updates with them. With this subscribe button you can still share your *public *updates with your friends as well as your Subscribers on Facebook keeping other personal updates visible to friends only. Let&#8217;s see how you can do this.

For this open your profile page (not homepage) and do the following steps:

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-48415" title="subscribe only" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/subscribe-only-600x310.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="310" />

&nbsp;

  1. After opening your profile click on the Subscribers link on the left sidebar. If you are doing this for the first time then click on Subscriptions and then click &#8216;Allow Subscribers&#8217;. Refresh the page and then click &#8216;Subscribers&#8217;.
  2. Now click on &#8216;Edit Settings&#8217; link on the top right of the page. This will open &#8216;Edit Subscribe Settings&#8217;.
  3. Now select &#8216;On&#8217; for subscribers. This will show the &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; button on your profile. Skip this step if it&#8217;s already &#8216;On&#8217;.
  4. Finally check this box given with &#8216;Friend Requests&#8217;. This will hide the &#8216;Add as a Friend&#8217; button for everyone on Facebook except friends of friends.

That&#8217;s it; your profile will now show only &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; button to everyone and &#8216;Add as a Friend&#8217; button to your friends of friends.
