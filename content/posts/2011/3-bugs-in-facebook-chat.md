Have you ever noticed bugs in Facebook chat? Well, I have and I get them every single day. I wonder why doesn&#8217;t anybody complain of that or some step has been taken?

When I open my Facebook account, I look for my online friends on Facebook chat. I see many of them. On clicking any one I get to know that a particular person is offline. Either that person sees me and logs out or this is a bug.

## Bugs in Facebook Chat:

  * A person appears to be online but is not.
  * When you click on a certain person, although the person is shown online he is not and you get no reply.
  * Sometimes the chat window disappears altogether.

After the news that phone number and home address have been made public (<a href="http://fbknol.com/privacy-threat-facebook-applications-access-home-address-phone-number/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/privacy-threat-facebook-applications-access-home-address-phone-number/', 'source']);" >source</a>) I have started having second thoughts on using Facebook.

These are very small things that do matter at times. How many of you have experienced it? What did you do? Did you try to complain about it? Share your views with me.
