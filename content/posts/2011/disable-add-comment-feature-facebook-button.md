After a quick search on Google, I finally found a simple solution to disable the **add comment** feature from the Facebook **like** button on your blog posts.

While using the Facebook **like** button on your blog with your standard layout, when you click the &#8216;like&#8217; button adjacent to the post, you have to login to your Facebook account and you also have to add a comment along with it.

It is also accompanied by a small pop-up box as shown in the screen shot below making your design look weird. If you don&#8217;t want to display such a pop-up box, look for the solution below :).

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="http://wpveda.com/disable-add-comment-feature-facebook-button/facebook-comment-box/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpveda.com/disable-add-comment-feature-facebook-button/facebook-comment-box/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-1868"></a><a href="http://wpveda.com/disable-add-comment-feature-facebook-button/facebook-comment-box/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpveda.com/disable-add-comment-feature-facebook-button/facebook-comment-box/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-1868"><img class="size-large  aligncenter wp-image-51075" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/facebook-comment-box-520x291.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="291" /></a>
</p>

This solution does not work for the **XFBML** version of the button. Only if you are using the** iframe** version of the button with the standard layout, you can use this method.

To add the FaceBook **like** button on your site go to:

<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like', 'http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like. ']);" >http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like. </a>

When you are customizing the Facebook &#8216;like&#8217; button, keep the layout &#8216;standard&#8217; and set the width of the button less than 400px.  If you keep the width more than 399px, the** Add Comment** link will be displayed.

This is how you can easily disable the Add comment feature from FaceBook the like button. If you have any queries I will try my best to give you a solution <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
