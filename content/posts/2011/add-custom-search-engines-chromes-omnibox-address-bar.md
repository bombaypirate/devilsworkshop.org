However you can add custom search engines to Chrome’s Omnibox using a simple hack. If you browse a site quite often, then this hack will save you a lot of time.

## Adding Custom Search Engines to Chrome

  1. Open Google Chrome on your Windows OS.
  2. Go to *options *> *manage search engines.*
  3. To add a custom search engine you need to fill the three boxes given in that page*.*
  4. Fill the first box with site’s name and second with site’s domain name.
  5. You need to fill the third box with the *search URL *and* replace the search query with %s, *for example you can get the *search URL* of Devils’ Workshop by doing any simple search in it.

After you’ve done adding the site to Chrome’s Omnibox, you just need to enter site’s URL and hit tab to start searching!
