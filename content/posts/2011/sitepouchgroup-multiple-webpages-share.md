Web designers and bloggers are often sharing a lot of links with friends. Many share up to 4-5 links everyday on a particular topic. Most do this over Twitter, Facebook or chat clients like Skype. The problem is it is disorganized and a good idea is to group together links on similar topics and share them as a group.

<a href="http://sitepouch.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sitepouch.com/', 'SitePouch']);" >SitePouch</a> allows you to drop-in URLs of multiple webpages and group the together.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="SitePouch_Multiple_Links" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/SitePouch_Multiple_Links_thumb.png" alt="SitePouch_Multiple_Links" width="448" height="504" border="0" />][1]

As you can see in the image above, you can drop in multiple URLs and create a SitePouch. This will allow create a short URL which can be shared with friends.

When a friend visits this URL, they can see the links and simply click on them will open them on a different tab on the browser. A good point is that users can see where the links are pointing towards as they are not shortened.

This is similar to [Bit.ly Bundles][2] and [Bridge URL][3] which also allow users to share multiple URLs by grouping them together. Such services can also be used for temporary online bookmarking.

Try out ***SitePouch** *and drop in your comments.

**Link: <a href="http://sitepouch.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sitepouch.com/', 'SitePouch']);" >SitePouch</a>**
