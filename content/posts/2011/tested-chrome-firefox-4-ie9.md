So I decided to take all the final, non-beta or non-RC versions of Firefox 4, IE 9 and Chrome on my computer and carry out a few tests to check theirÂ performance.

I prefer the Chrome user-interface because it is so sparse and simple. IE9 and Firefox 4 try hard but I am not really happy with its user-interface. But then interface is a personal thing and hence I decided to go with performance.

I carried out two tests, one was the ACID 3 and the other was HTML 5 test.

I first tested Chrome, Firefox 4 and IE9 for the Acid 3 test. The Acid 3 test basically tests web standards regarding CSS, website rendering. The test was made famous by Chrome when it got a 100/100. This led Chrome to design a method to <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-add-chrome-frame-to-your-website/" target="_blank">insert Chrome frame into IE8 for making it faster</a>.

  * Chrome as expected for a 100/100 on the test.

  * Internet Explorer 9 scored a 95/100 with the Acid3 test. This is a big improvement because I remember in a post last year, I had performed quite badly.

  * Firefox 4 final version scored a 97/100 which. That seems to be a big improvement but still short of the perfect score set by Chrome.

## The <a href="http://html5test.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://html5test.com/', 'HTML5 Test']);" target="_blank">HTML5 Test</a>!

This is a test to decide how well does the browser we are using support HTML5 standards. This has been a big talking point, with HTML 5 supposedly being branded as a web-standard. Internet Explorer version have traditionally fared poorly.

A look at the <a href="http://html5test.com/results.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://html5test.com/results.html', 'stats from their website']);" target="_blank">stats from their website</a>, show that Chrome scores 288 while Internet Explorer scores 130. The score for Firefox 4 final version is 240. This is strange as I remember Firefox 4 RC version scored 255!

## So is Chrome better than IE9 and Firefox 4?

The answer to that is yes. If it was purely about performance, then Chrome does far better than Internet Explorer 9 and Firefox 4. I did find the final version of Firefox 4 a lot faster than its predecessors but it still has taken way too much time to come out with version 4. While Firefox and IE released beta version slowly, Chrome kept updating its version automatically and so often that it stopped announcing the updated versions altogether.

What are your views on Chrome, Firefox 4 and IE9 as far as performance goes? Do drop in your comments.
