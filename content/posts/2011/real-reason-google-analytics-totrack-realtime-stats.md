As a blogger or webmaster, Google Analytics is probably the first thing they setup. It basically tracks every page view, visit on each page, time spent on a page etc.

Almost all bloggers who want to grow their blog will look at what works on their website thanks to data displayed on Google Analytics.Â Google recentlyÂ <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a>Â it will be rolling out real-time statistics on a website.

If you are using Google Analytics, make sure you are using the new version. The new real-time stats will show up under dashboard. Currently it is not rolled out to everyone and but it should be available for everyone over the next few days.

### Impact of Google Analytics Realtime

  * Real Time statistics also will show active visitors on the site along with new and returning visitors.
  * It will also show top referrals as in what amount of traffic in realtime is being sent from Google or social media.
  * Top active pages will shows the most visited pages at that moment. This will be useful to leverage that page further for bloggers, especially if it is a trending topic.

One of the best improvements of getting traffic stats in realtime would be to see how social media impacts traffic. For example you share a link on Twitter or Facebook, it would be a great help to see how much and for how long does it get traffic for your blog.

### Is Google preparing for Google+ Brands

I am probably speculating, but I think Google Analytics Realtime is just one of the few tracking improvements that are coming along. At some point, when Brands have their own Google+ profiles, it will be useful to have a powerful tool with like Google Analytics giveÂ real-timeÂ stats. ðŸ˜‰
