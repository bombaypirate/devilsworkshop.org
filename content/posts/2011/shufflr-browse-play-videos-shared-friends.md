This is true for tutorials, manuals and even just looking up the news.  
When it comes to videos, we often end up watching what our friends do. This is thanks to Facebook and Twitter. Videos when they go viral are usually spread through social networking sites.

<a href="http://shufflr.tv/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://shufflr.tv/', 'Shufflr']);" >Shufflr</a> is a video player which shows you videos according to your interests and also taps into your social sphere.

## About <a href="http://shufflr.tv" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://shufflr.tv', 'Shufflr.Tv']);" >Shufflr.Tv</a>

  * First I had to download the software on my computer. A good this is that it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux systems.
  * We also have to register on Shufflr and create an account. This will prompt for atleast 4 tags you like.
  * Based on what you put out there as categories you are interested in, it will stream you videos.
  * Another great feature is that I could link up Shufflr with my Twitter and Facebook account. This makes my video list very social. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

*Here is video that covers some basics of Shufflr.*  


If you are interested in having a desktop application to view online videos, then Shufflr seems like a great option. Do try it out and let me know your views through your comments.
