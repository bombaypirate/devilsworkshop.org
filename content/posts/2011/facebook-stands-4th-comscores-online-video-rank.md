How many videos do you watch online ? How many are on Facebook? Well, I have observed that these days people watch and share more videos on Facebook than on any other website.

Nearly 47 million people in the U.S. watched videos on Facebook in February. More than one out of every four Americans who watched video online did so on Facebook in February. A total of 170 million watched online video content in February for an average of 13.6 hours per viewer, and total number of viewing sessions exceeding five billion.

Well, Google sites are the first one in the list. Then Microsoft and Yahoo sites respectively. So, what do you think ? Is this stats correct according to you ? How many times do you watch videos online and on which site ? Share your view with me.
