If you use a couple of cloud services, you’ll know the pain of managing files across them. I have some important files stored on my Dropbox account but I even have some documents on Google Docs, now here Otixo comes into the play and helps me in managing those files.

To keep it simple, Otixo is like Windows explorer for your files on the cloud!

## Otixo Features

  * Manage all your files on the cloud from a single dashboard.
  * Otixo currently supports 6 cloud services including Google Docs, Box.net, Dropbox, WebTV, MobileMe and FTP.
  * You can copy files from one cloud service to another, search for files on all cloud services at a time.
  * Ability to download and upload files, additionally, you can also rename, cut, paste and delete the files.

## Otixo on Desktop

If you don’t spend much of your time on browsing, then you might be interested in this. On Windows XP and Windows 7 you can map the network drive and thus manage the files directly from the desktop.

Here’s how you can do it on Windows XP &#8211;

  * Click Start, open *My network places.*

  * Double-click on *Add network place.*
  * Proceed by clicking next and enter the network address as ***https://dav.otixo.com.***.

  * Then enter your username and password to login and name your drive and you’re done.

For Windows 7 Users &#8211; Otixo has a tutorial on how to map the network drive on Windows 7.

### The Big Question

The war between cloud services is getting hotter day by day, and now even <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/apples-icloud-legalize-pirated-music-2499/" target="_blank">Apple introduced its so called iCloud</a>. The question is, will these cloud services allow Otixo to grow? Let’s take example of Dropbox, as it’s one of the cloud service supported by Otixo, it is indirectly supporting other cloud services (Box, Google Docs etc)!

I know, only time can answer this one.

## Otixo in Action
