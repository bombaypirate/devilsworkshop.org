If you want to upload your videos somewhere then Facebook is an alternate option too after websites like youtube and megavideo. You can upload any video on it and share it with your friends as well on your website or anyone on the net. But if you don&#8217;t know how to share it with people who are not on Facebook have a look at the method below.

### How to extract video link:

Upload a video on Facebook or open an existing video. Now click on &#8217;embed this video&#8217; given below that video.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-44344" title="video facebook-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/09/video-facebook-1-600x438.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="438" />

Also make sure that your video is Public. That means everyone on the internet can see it. If your video is private then this tutorial will be of no use as one must login to Facebook to see that.

Now copy the Embed code and paste it somewhere like on notepad. For example the embed code for my video is:

*<object width=&#8221;400&#8243; height=&#8221;300&#8243; ><param name=&#8221;allowfullscreen&#8221; value=&#8221;true&#8221; /><param name=&#8221;movie&#8221; value=&#8221;http://www.facebook.com/v/2214868644923&#8243; /><embed src=&#8221;http://www.facebook.com/v/2214868644923&#8243; type=&#8221;application/x-shockwave-flash&#8221; allowfullscreen=&#8221;true&#8221; width=&#8221;400&#8243; height=&#8221;300&#8243;></embed></object>  
*

You Embed code will be like this only, except some change in video link. See the above Embed code, the actual link of my video is the value in it, that is:

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/v/2214868644923" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/v/2214868644923', 'http://www.facebook.com/v/2214868644923']);" target="_blank"><em>http://www.facebook.com/v/2214868644923</em></a>

**You can click on the link to see that video even if you are not logged into Facebook. The video will be in its maximum size but full screen option won&#8217;t work here.

### Usage:

This video link might not be useful for all of you but you can use it in some cases like:

  1. Sharing a video where you don&#8217;t want people to know that who uploaded it.
  2. Sharing it as a comment on different websites.
  3. Sending the video to people who are not in your friend&#8217;s list.
  4. Sharing a video on different pages on Facebook.
  5. Sharing it on your website without embedding and not uploading on Youtube in order to keep limited viewers.
