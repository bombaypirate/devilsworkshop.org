After <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-secure-login-and-picture-captcha/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-secure-login-and-picture-captcha/', 'tightening security']);" >tightening security</a> towards the Facebook login, now Facebook is doing something for developers as well. Now Facebook developers need to choose whether they are admin or just testers and hence the functionality is divided (<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/455" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/455', 'source']);" >source</a>).

If you come across a Facebook application you can choose among the following:

  * Administrator &#8211; complete access to the application and all its settings
  * Developer &#8211; can modify all technical settings and access Insights but cannot reset secret key, delete application, or add additional users
  * Tester &#8211; can test the application in sandbox mode but cannot change the application
  * Insights User &#8211; can access Insights but cannot modify the application

As you can see in the image above, you can choose to be any one of the above and see how it affects your experience.

You can also monitor and control changes to your application in a better way. when somebody changes something you get the notification through your email. (you can choose to do that)

If you wish to know more about the features you can do that from <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/applicationsecurity/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/docs/applicationsecurity/', 'Developers documentation']);" >Developers documentation</a>.
