According to them the services are up for most of the regions except few carriers and inter-continent messages are still down. But this official information seems fake and services for me (specially BBM) are still down. Let&#8217;s have a look at what they have said.

### BlackBerry Service update:

**Europe, Middle East, India and Africa**:

E-Mail services are back and users are getting E-Mails without any delay. However I&#8217;m still experiencing some delays and getting some E-Mails from my inbox not all of them. Officially BBM is up but I still can&#8217;t send BBM to others even in the same country so the service is officially up and technically down. Internet Browsing is temporarily not available.

**Canada and Latin America:**

E-Mails, BBMs and Browsing are working fine but BBM and Browsing is currently unavailable for some carriers.

**U.S:**

E-Mails, BBMs and Browsing all are working fine. They are continuously working to remove any ****backlogged messages.

Service for some regions is working fine now but users are still facing some difficulties and users still can&#8217;t send messages from one region to another. But this official info definitely made some relief to frustated and BBM addicted BlackBerry users. Stay connected for more updates.

Also don&#8217;t forget to give us BBM service updates in your region. Drop a comment below with your BB Pin. ðŸ˜‰
