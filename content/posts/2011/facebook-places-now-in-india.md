Facebook places let your friends know where are you, what are you up to . ðŸ˜‰ If you are using Facebook on phone then you must be knowing this. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> See where friends are. Discover new places.

With Facebook places you also get <a href="http://fbknol.com/mazda-offers-discount-on-facebook-deals/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/mazda-offers-discount-on-facebook-deals/', 'Facebook deals']);" >Facebook deals</a>. There are certain deals and offers specially for you if you using it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Well, the news is that Facebook places are now working in India on Blackberry and iPhone <a href="http://www.clickonf5.org/social/facebook-places-working-india-iphone-blackberry/11727" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.clickonf5.org/social/facebook-places-working-india-iphone-blackberry/11727', '(Source)']);" >(Source)</a> !

My <a href="http://twitter.com/msigeek" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/msigeek', 'friend ']);" >friend </a> has this feature and using it. I personally feel very happy when Facebook rolls out some feature for usage in India. Generally all the features are delayed here. I wonder what is the reason.

Well, do let me know if you also have this feature. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Share your views on the usage.
