Facebook 2.0 is said to have an official target release date of May 2011, with an even earlier Beta 2 release projected for March 2011. <a href="http://n4bb.com/4522/first-look-at-facebook-2-0-for-blackberry" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://n4bb.com/4522/first-look-at-facebook-2-0-for-blackberry', 'N4BB']);" >N4BB</a> has some screen shots of this thing.
