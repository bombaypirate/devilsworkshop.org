A moment ago, Facebook launched it it&#8217;s new design with lot&#8217;s of changes in it&#8217;s theme. This new interface is good and isn&#8217;t irritating like it&#8217;s older design changes. But somehow I feel that Facebook copied things from Google+ which is a recently launched Social Networking website from Google.

Like Google plus, Facebook also started showing bigger pictures in it&#8217;s news feed. Pictures uploaded by you or even those pics on which you have commented or liked. Also there&#8217;s a new &#8216;This is a Highlight&#8217; feature which will move that post to top posts. Let&#8217;s have a look at all the changes in new Facebook design.

1. No option of switching between &#8216;Recent Posts&#8217; and Top Posts&#8217;. It shows RECENT STORIES by default and once you will refresh the page it will show &#8216;Stories From The Last 5 Days&#8217;.

2. Just like Google+, Facebook is not showing the space for sharing status by default. You have to click on the option &#8216;Share: Status&#8217; first and then it&#8217;s will be opened.

3. New option of &#8216;This is a Highlight&#8217;. If you select this option for a post it will be shown in Top Posts to you and other mutual users. That means every post is a highlighted post in &#8216;Stories From The Last 5 Days&#8217;.

4. Little change in the way events are shown, now click on an event won&#8217;t open it in a new window, rather it will show a small tab in the same page. In case of birthdays, this tab will show space to wish birthdays directly on that person&#8217;s wall.

5. New Ticker, In this ticker your friend&#8217;s updates will be shown just like a news channel shows &#8216;breaking news&#8217; on bottom of the channel. Again this will not be opened in a new window, it&#8217;ll just open a temporary small tab. (See the image below).

6. Again a feature copied from Google+, Facebook started showing images uploaded by you, those you have liked or commented. Also the size of these images is comparable to those in Google plus and it&#8217;ll be opened in the black window like Facebook used to show.

7. A minor change, Facebook moved some of it&#8217;s links from footer to it&#8217;s sidebar. These links are Advertising · Careers · Privacy · Terms · Help · English (US) and Facebook © 2011.

These are some changes in the new Facebook design, please inform me if I missed anything. And don&#8217;t forget to tell us whether you liked the new design or not?

***Note: Please note that Facebook is still testing this design and it&#8217;s not available to everyone yet.***
