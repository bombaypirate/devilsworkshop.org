Yes the wait is finally over now, after a waiting period of so many weeks and after so many [delays][1], Facebook finally launched their Timeline profiles worldwide including India. Facebook just updated their official blog regarding the same. For those who still don&#8217;t know about the Timeline, it&#8217;s a completely new layout of Facebook profiles where you can add music, videos, photos and other applications to your profile. It also creates a sequence of your time to time events that can be accessed later on.
