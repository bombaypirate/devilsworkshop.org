excerpt: I was going through some old articles when I found an article on the new Search engine called Blekko written by Shradha Rao. I was initially amazed to see something new challenging “Google” (though challenges are bought soon by Google!) but later found it “not too good” to replace Google at least for now.

I was going through some old articles when I found an [article on the new Search engine called ][1][Blekko][1]. I was initially amazed to see something new challenging “Google” (though challenges are bought soon by Google ;)) but later found it “not too good” to replace Google at least for now. I could understand the dilemma of the  Internet users, so I decided to do a comparative Case Study to find out the real truth.

## Search by Location

  * Search string for both – “Dominos Pune”

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW googleblekko2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-googleblekko2_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW googleblekko2" width="554" height="339" />][2]

If we see above, Google is displaying very much relevant results alongwith the exact branches of “Dominos”.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW googleblekko1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-googleblekko1_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW googleblekko1" width="554" height="350" />][3]

Now if we see Blekko, the results starting from 1st through 3rd can be considered of “low relavance”. However the 4th result has crossed the borders of relevancy.

You might question why I have not used the slash tag before “Pune”. My answer to that will be that still no such tag exists, even a tag to India do not exists yet, forget Pune.

## Search by Category

  * Search string at Google – “blogs travel”
  * Search string at Blekko – “blogs /travel”

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW googleblekko3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-googleblekko3_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW googleblekko3" width="554" height="373" />][4]

If you see the above results at Google, you will actually be able to relate the results with the search string.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW googleblekko4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-googleblekko4_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW googleblekko4" width="554" height="465" />][5]

Now check the results at Blekko. No need to rub your eyes, what you can see is true and the least relevant. Though the results are somewhat related to “travel”, I am not sure how much you will be liking such results yourself.

## Search by Latest

  * Search string at Google – “Egypt” and then selected “Latest”
  * Search string at Blekko – “Egypt /date”

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW googleblekko5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-googleblekko5_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW googleblekko5" width="554" height="656" />][6]

Just clicking on the **Latest** link gives a lot of results including the related tweets @ Twitter. If you see the news below the twitter feed too, the latest news sorted by time is displayed at Google. You can even see the **Top updates** on the right side and can check the **Realtime** section too.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW googleblekko6" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-googleblekko6_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW googleblekko6" width="554" height="362" />][7]

This is still relevant though there is nothing too special in the results except sorting based on time. The same, infact better activity is just displayed above by Google.

I would still like to have your opinion from everyone whether you feel still Blekko can take over Google or atleast reach somewhere near? Would it be able to handle the pressure of being overtaken? Please drop in your comments.
