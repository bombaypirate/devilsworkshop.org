LastPass stores all these online passwords in encrypted form. Even its tagline suggests that LastPass master passwords is the last password you will ever need. Ironically LastPass security seems to have been compromised and users might have problems accessing their passwords.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="LastPass_Logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/LastPass_Logo_thumb.png" border="0" alt="LastPass_Logo" width="302" height="302" />][1]

LastPass has requested all its users to go ahead and change their passwords to secure their accounts.

LastPass on its blog mentioned

> We noticed an issue yesterday and wanted to alert you to it. As a precaution, we&#8217;re also forcing you to change your master password.

In recent times, when almost everyone has 2-3 different online accounts for email, social, twitter and bookmarking – it is a good idea to store all the passwords in single place. LastPass is a popular service used by people who have many online accounts and use it on many different platforms.

But when the storage service itself might have issues, it can start a panic. At the moment it does not seem to be something major, but it has only been few hours. Real damage if any will be known in the days to come.
