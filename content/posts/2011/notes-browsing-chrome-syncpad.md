I love Simplenote, especially its simplicity which Evernote, Springpad and other popular note taking apps lack. As I spend most of my time on the browser, I like to have extensions of the apps which I use the most.

SyncPad for Simplenote and SyncPad Webnotes are two extensions for Chrome which ease the task of taking notes and syncing them.
