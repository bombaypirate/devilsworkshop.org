Today I noticed in the right hand side of my Facebook page that it was prompting me to see some of the status updates. These status updates are those that received maximum like and comments.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-telling-memorable-status-of-2010/memorable-2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-telling-memorable-status-of-2010/memorable-2/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-5167"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5167" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Memorable1.png" alt="" width="282" height="274" /></a>

This is a good way to remind us how our year went. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There was an application that told us our year in status updates. It showed us all the status updates in a story way. Whereas memorable status also shows the status updates but only those that received maximum likes.
