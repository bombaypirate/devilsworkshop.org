Lenovo has recently introduced a couple of tablets which are Android based. The IdeaPad K1 and A1 Tablets and Thinkpad Tablet are probably launched with one eye to the Diwali season in India.

Currently Lenovo does have a healthy share in laptops and so it moving into the tablet space seems natural. It is still anyone&#8217;s guess if it will manage to compete with entrenched brand names like Samsung and iPad in this niche.

## Lenovo IdeaPad Tablet K1

This tablet is meant for personal use and entertainment. It does have a 10.1’ inch display screen along with upto 10 hours of battery life. It also supports 1280X800 HD Resolution.

Other features include support for Flash, USB ports, Front and back camera, Mini HDMI connector. It will run on Android 3.1

The tablet supports WiFi and has two versions when for storage which are 16GB and 32 GB.

**Approximate Price: **Rs. 29,500/-

## Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet

The ThinkPad Tablet, is meant to be useful for corporate users and hence supports trackpoint navigation, digitizer pen input and extra security features. It also like the IdeaPad K1 has a 10.1’ inch display screen along with upto 8 hours of battery life.

Connectivity will be through WiFi, Sim

It includes support for Flash, USB Ports are available along with front and back camera. It will also run on Android 3.1.

The tablet supports WiFi and 3G connections. It has three versions when for storage which are 16GB, 32GB and finally a 64GB version.

## Lenovo IdeaPad A1

This tablet might be very successful in India, considering its low price. It has a smaller screen which is only 7.1’ inches, and up to 7 hours of battery life. Display resolution is also 1024X600.

It has front and back camera along with SD card reader and supports Flash content. It will run on Android 2.3.

The tablet supports connectivity only via WiFi and has up to 16GB storage space.

I think Lenovo does have a decent number of customers in India but I am not sure all its tablets will be as well received. The lower end cheaper tablet might do well. One thing is for sure that as the holiday seasons comes closer we can expect a lot more tablets and mobile phones being made available in India.

Would you go for a Lenovo tablet instead of the more famous brands associated with Tablets? Do drop in your comments and views.
