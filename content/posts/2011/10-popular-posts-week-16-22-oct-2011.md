The week was interesting to say the least, mainly because Google search had a small outage. We are not surprised that the post on this outage made it into the most popular posts. But as a blogger, it was heartening to see a JQuery tutorial make it to the top as our most popular post. When it comes to popularity, tutorials beat trends. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
