Samsung has become one of the biggest vendors for Android phones. It is soon bring out Galaxy R into parts of Asia and Europe. According to a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/10/samsung-galaxy-r-officially-announced-for-europe-and-asia-nobod/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/10/samsung-galaxy-r-officially-announced-for-europe-and-asia-nobod/', 'blog post']);" title="engadget">blog post</a> I read, the phone is already available in Sweden. The big news is that it will skip North American markets at least for now.

## North America ignored for Samsung R phone

The Galaxy R phone will be available in  Eastern and Western Europe, East Asia, South East Asia, West Asia, China. This means it is giving a skip to the North American markets for the moment.

Samsung Galaxy S2 will be launched very soon in the US according to rumours, so Samsung might have kept this model out of North America for that particular reason.

### Availability in India for Samsung Galaxy R?

South-Asia does not seem to be in the scheme of things for Galaxy R phones at the moment but it should be available sooner than later, looking at the demand for mobile market in India.
