Yesterday, I was almost about to sleep when suddenly I noticed a small icon on my Chrome browser toolbar which indicates that there is a pending update. I immediately allowed the operation and my browser re-started. When I checked the ‘About’ section, I was amazed to see the new ‘Beta’ version of Chrome, i.e. 10.0 (10.0.648.82 to be specific).

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DW chrome10" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-chrome10_thumb.png" border="0" alt="DW chrome10" width="542" height="314" />][1]

## What all is New?

  * Chrome 10.0 comes with an updated V8 engine for JavaScript processing which is 66% faster.
  * The beta also adds support for GPU video acceleration, which is said to decrease the CPU usage by a whopping 80%. Ultimately, this would let you be more multi-tasking and even save on battery life.
  * Another change you should notice is the browser Settings now opens in a different tab instead of the old ‘window’ style.
  * You can even search for a specific thing you are looking for inside the Settings section.
  * Now you can sync your saved passwords too alongwith the other browser settings. Don’t be afraid, it will allow to set a separate password to encrypt your saved passwords.

Rest you can understand better by looking at the video.
