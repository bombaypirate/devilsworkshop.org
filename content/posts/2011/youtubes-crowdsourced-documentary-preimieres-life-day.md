<a rel="attachment wp-att-36691" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/youtubes-crowdsourced-documentary-preimieres-life-day/youtube_life_day/"><img class="size-full wp-image-36691 alignright" title="youtube_life_day" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/youtube_life_day.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>YouTube has created a snapshot of the entire world&#8217;s life in a day. This has been done through an initiative of YouTube in which anyone with a video camera could record a few moments of their life in a particular day and send it to YouTube.

The idea was for people to record and send clips on the 24th July, 2010 on YouTube. It was an experiment in which literally thousands contributed. Oscar-winning director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Macdonald_(director)" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Macdonald_(director)', 'Kevin Macdonald']);" >Kevin Macdonald</a> along with a team of editors went through over 80,000 clips and 4500 hours of footage to put together a 90-minute documentary about life in one single day across the world.

I am sure the documentary will be interesting and worth looking up. It premieres at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival', 'Sundance Festival 2011']);" >Sundance Festival 2011</a>.

If you want view the premiere you can check it out at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lifeinaday" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/lifeinaday', 'YouTube&#8217;s Life in a day Channel']);" >YouTube&#8217;s Life in a day Channel</a>.

You can see this live at 8.00 pm EST  (6.30 am IST). That can be a little inconvenient for people outside the U.S. In that case you can catch its repeat broadcast is at 7.00 pm, 28th January 2011,  local time where ever you are in the world.

Here is a short teaser of the documentary.
