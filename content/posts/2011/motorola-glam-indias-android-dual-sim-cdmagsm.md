In an attempt to increase its market share in a country like India, Motorola finally appears to take steps towards some innovation and hence launched the first ever Android phone with Dual sim (CDMA + GSM) technology known as the &#8216;Milestone XT800&#8242; or simply **Motorola Glam**. The phone is a touch-screen and supports almost all features a user might be looking for in a smartphone. The price tag is around Rs. 32000 which might look big initially though it&#8217;s a great new comer for users of both CDMA as well as GSM. However now, the phone will be exclusively sold by AirTyme Communications in India.

I think this is going to be a great buy for users who are not even willing to leave the strong CDMA network as well as want to have a nice Android phone. However you need to compromise on the Android version. Think and then comment, &#8220;are you gonna buy it?&#8221;
