Web apps have changed a lot with more and more people using add-ons instead of toolbars. This is mainly because most toolbars are limited in its scope and add-on allow a variety of functions from managing Facebook, Twitter and even your email accounts.

ALOT Toolbar allows sharing links, searching for content and looking up social networking accounts by allowing adding specific apps to it.

## Features of ALOT toolbar

  * The ALOT Toolbar will work with your Internet Explorer and Firefox browser. This leaves out Chrome users which is a bit of a disappointment.
  * I could look up Facebook, BBC News, even Wikipedia articles from the toolbar itself.
  * Just click on the add app button on your browser and we can customize the apps that are present in your toolbar.

Usually I do not like toolbars, but I recommend using ALOT toolbars simply for the sheer number of apps available with it. Do drop in your comments.
