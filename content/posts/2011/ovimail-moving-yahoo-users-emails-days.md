Ovi Mail is a mail service used by Nokia users. Today, most Ovi Mail users received an email that Nokia is partnering with Yahoo to enhance Ovi Mail. The email sent out shows Nokia is making some interesting partners. Microsoft has recently paid them $1 Billion to stay away from Android. The partnership was announced last year in July 2010, but actual transition of Ovi Mail accounts to Yahoo will start this week.

Below is an excerpt form the email sent out to Ovi Mail users.

> Once the transition starts, you will immediately begin receiving new

> old emails for several days until the transition has finished**.  Don’t

The thing that might concern **Ovi Mail** account users is that, users might not be able to see their old emails for several days. The emails will be accessible to Ovi Mail users once the transition is done. This email is a little vague. There is not timeframe that defines several days. Several days could mean 3-4 days or even 20 days.

Nokia has made some strange partnerships. It has partnered with Microsoft, which seems to be a smart move as they will be <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/microsoft-pays-1-billion-nokia-woo-android/" target="_blank">receiving 1$ Billion from Microsoft</a>. Yahoo as a partner is quite strange. In my opinion <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/fall-yahoos-empire-100-billion-22-billion/" target="_blank">Yahoo is a bit of a sinking ship</a>.

What are your views on this Nokia and Yahoo partnership? Do you think Ovi Mail experience will actually be enhanced?
