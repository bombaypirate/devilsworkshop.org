Also services like Hootsuite and [Digsby][2] which are useful for managing and sharing updates across two or three different social networks have not yet integrated Google+.

With <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oenpjldbckebacipkfbcoppmiflglnib" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oenpjldbckebacipkfbcoppmiflglnib', 'Google Plus Extended Share']);" >Google Plus Extended Share</a> extension for Chrome, users can share something they see on their Google Plus feeds and share it on their Twitter or Facebook accounts.

## Google+ to Facebook and Twitter

The extension adds a new ‘Send To’ option with your Google Plus updates. Clicking on it will give you the option of sharing the link to that update on Twitter and Facebook.

I found that the options with “Send To” showed up with any publicly shared Google+ post which means I could share posts by my friends on Google+ too.

I am sure that once Google+ is out of beta, users will get a lot of integration options for sharing one update across many different social networks.

But for the moment this extension seems to be nifty for cross-sharing across profiles on different networks.

Do try out the extension if you are using Chrome and drop in your comments.
