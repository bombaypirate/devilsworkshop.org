As a blogger, I have never seen an service outage that lasts almost forever. This week BlackBerry users did not lose BBM and messaging service for a few hours but for literally over 3 days. It was also our most popular story for the week.

Other than that, we also covered the sad news of Dennis Ritchie’s passing away. I must say, that if he had not created C language and Unix Operating System, our world would have still been a lot different. Much of today’s technology is built on his creation.
