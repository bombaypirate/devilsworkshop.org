A man is trying to sue Facebook with a law suit of $500,000 for disabling his account. Wow, a big angry man we have in here.

Well, Mustafa Fteja&#8217;s  account was disabled without explanation in September, since then he is all cut out from his friends and family. He says it was his only way to contact them (what about gtalk, gmail or Yahoo <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).

Mustafa tried many times to complain, call or just get an explanation about it but all in vain? So totally disturbed he is finally taking this step. What do you think would have been the reason?

I wonder why he didn&#8217;t make a new profile? Why did he keep asking or mailing Facebook people to get that account back. I know it had friends and his memories but they all could have been replaced. All this makes me think that when it comes to Facebook people are loosing themselves now. One more point came to my mind that says Facebook doesn&#8217;t care you are alive, dead, you have an account or you don&#8217;t have any. If at all they cared then one email would have been sufficient in telling whats wrong.

He has so much of money to sue Facebook instead make a new one. I would love to have your views on it. Please share what you think about it.
