Wow, great so yesterday we all were so excited that we are going to get a Facebook phone has turned out to be a rumor. ðŸ˜› Earlier also there was a lot of<a href="http://fbknol.com/get-ready-for-a-face-phone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/get-ready-for-a-face-phone/', ' rumor']);" > rumor</a> about Facebook phone.

Dan Rose, head of business development at Facebook. said that

> This is really just another example of a manufacturer who has taken our public APIs (application programing interfaces) and integrated them into their device in an interesting way

He also mentioned that

> The rumors around there being something more to this HTC device are overblown.

According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70Q4G520110127" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70Q4G520110127', 'Reuters']);" >Reuters</a>, mobile drives 250 million users on Facebook, that is Facebook gets a lot of traffic from mobile phones per month.

Do you think Facebook should get a mobile phone of itself ?How will that affect the other mobiles in the market? Do share your thoughts with me.
