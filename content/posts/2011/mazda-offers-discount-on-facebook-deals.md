When you check in to places from your mobile phone, you can avail many offers if they are available in your country. Well, this can be a nice way to advertise about the products or shops and off course Facebook usage will be increased. If I am given an option to avail the offer then obviously I will use my phone and Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

But, here is the deal, <a href="http://www.mazda.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mazda.com/', 'Mazda']);" >Mazda</a> the famous Car company is offering  20% discount for people every month for five months to customers who &#8220;check-in&#8221; at one of their five nominated places. People love to get offers and with this deal that lets you get offers by using Facebook, will rock!

What is the future of such deals? I guess then Facebook will know about our whereabouts also. Is that acceptable? What do you think? Share your views with me here.
