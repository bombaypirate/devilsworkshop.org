A couple in Israel, have reportedly named their daughter “Like” after the Facebook button. Strange as it may seem, the parents wanted a unique and different name for their daughter. They decided they liked “Like” as a name.

Facebook seems to be really getting too much hold on our lives. Earlier in the year, a man decided to honour Facebook role in the Egyptian revolution by <a href="http://fbknol.com/young-egyptian-names-his-daughter-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/young-egyptian-names-his-daughter-facebook/', 'naming his daughter “Facebook”']);" >naming his daughter “Facebook”</a>.

This sort of craze is a little unsettling. A name is for a lifetime and who knows 10-15 years later if Facebook will be around or not. Or what name the social network might go under by then.

Do drop in your comments.
