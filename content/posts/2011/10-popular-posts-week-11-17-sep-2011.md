This week we had an even more busy week than the previous one. We covered the tech world in a total of 24 posts this week. That increased the competition for the 10 most popular posts this weekend.

We also introduced a ***Contest*** this week, where you can win a Full Pass for **ABC Cloud Computing – India Forum to be held in Mumbai**. If you are interested in participating, look it up [here][1].

As far as our most popular post this week, it was the one in which we discovered that our [Facebook Passwords are not really case-sensitive][2].
