<a href="http://www.breakupnotifier.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.breakupnotifier.com/', 'Breakup Notifier']);" >Breakup Notifier</a> is one such application that lets you sign up for email alerts about break ups. Ahh! I wonder how did this idea come to some one. Here are the steps to perfectly stalk the person :

  * Go to <a href="http://www.breakupnotifier.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.breakupnotifier.com/', 'this application']);" >this application</a>.
  * Log in with your Facebook account.
  * Check all those people in your friend list who are in a relationship.
  * You are done, now wait for an email!

Whenever a person changes his relationship status, you will get the email and well yeah you can start with your stalking. I mean seriously, the Facebook business is in a boom these days. Create an app to tell about future, your horoscope, your luck percentage and now this. Facebook gives a chance to stalk people and many apps are in market due to this!

Will you try such application yourself ? Share your views with me. It scares me enough to not share any status online!
