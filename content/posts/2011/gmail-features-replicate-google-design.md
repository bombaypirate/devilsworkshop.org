As Google+ is setting the internet on fire with a [mad rush for new invites][2] for checking the new social media product.

Google is convinced that they have got a killer design with Google Plus, and hence are moving to make Gmail look a lot more like Google+.

## The Current Design of Gmail

The current design in fine. As someone who uses Gmail everyday, I like the current design was a little concerned what the new design would look like.

Gmail offers users to change the theme at Settings >> Themes and select the Preview Themes which give a good idea of how Gmail will look in the future.

## The planned design for Gmail

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Gmail_design_google_plus" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/Gmail_design_google_plus_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Gmail_design_google_plus" width="570" height="327" />][4]

The new design plans to make GmailÂ more easy to use, with the user interface becoming a lot more cleaner. Users might not be happy with such design changes as most times, people are used to a particular design and have some sort of visual memory that can make them resist the idea of a new design.

Google will be rolling out new design and features across all Google products to make it more social. It seems this time Google will leave no stone unturned to make sure it cracks the social media puzzle.
