Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) introduced something unusual in order to control spam SMSes and calls you got from different telemarketing firms. Rather than limiting these firms SMS limits they put a limit to every cellular user in India that no one can send more than 100 SMS per day for prepaid users and 3000 per month for postpaid users.

Well obviously TRAI is trying to do something good because these SMSes are so annoying but their way of spam control is not good at all. 100 SMS per day is nothing for a normal user specially when you have so many SMS cards in the market with more than 20,000 free SMSes per day. Even I personally send 200 to 300 SMSes per day as these messages are a good and important way of communicating and a part of life now. You can&#8217;t talk on phone every time and everywhere so it&#8217;s better to inform somebody something by Texting.

Also Do Not Disturb (DND) policy will be more strict now and you won&#8217;t receive unwanted calls and SMSes once registered for DND service. To register yourself to DND service use any of the following methods:

  * SMS START 0 to 1909 for fully blocking bulk SMS
  * Dial Toll Free Number 1909 and Register
  * Through NCC-TRAI Website: <a href="http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/', 'http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry']);" target="_blank">http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry</a>

This is a good initiative by TRAI but I would prefer to receive 1-2 spam SMS everyday rather than this limit of 100 SMSes per day. People will start using instant messaging services like BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) and Whatsapp more if this limit continues.
