The mass demonstrations sweeping the Middle East are touching the Palestinian territories, where West Bank and Gaza Strip activists are trying to organize their own &#8220;Facebook revolutions.&#8221;

The Palestinian activists are inspired with what happened through Facebook in <a href="http://fbknol.com/thank-you-facebook-egypt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/thank-you-facebook-egypt/', 'Egypt&#8217;s case']);" >Egypt&#8217;s case</a>. Palestinians seek an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, that is areas on different sides of Israel and ruled by rival governments.

In recent weeks, activists using Facebook have brought hundreds of people onto streets of the West Bank, waving Palestinian flags and calling for change. Smaller gatherings have taken place in Gaza. The protesters hope to stage a massive demonstration in both areas on March 15.

Let&#8217;s wish them luck and see what happens next. Share your views with me on this.
