Did you notice status updates saying how much addicted are you on Facebook? Well, that is another fake application or scam that asks you to complete a set of quiz.

When I saw this update on one of my friend&#8217;s wall, I tried to know that so clicked on the link. It asked me to complete a set of surveys or quiz as below.

I didn&#8217;t click on any of these but still ¬†the message was posted as below.

None of the above is true! Earlier there was an application on it. It did tell you your addiction without making you click on things. Whataver,Ill suggest you something just look at the time you spend on Facebook and you&#8217;ll know how much addicted are you to it. üòÄ

Do let me know what is your addiction level on Facebook. Share your views with me.
