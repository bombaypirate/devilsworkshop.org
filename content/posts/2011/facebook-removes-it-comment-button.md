Yes, Facebook has axed down the comment button. I noticed this when I was commenting on some photographs and posts, and suddenly I realised something was missing.

Much loved little blue button that said &#8216;comment&#8217; , has been removed now. Just imagine the feeling you used to get when you wrote something, checked it twice and clicked on Comment. Well, now its just write something and press &#8216;enter&#8217;.

Well I have started missing it. What about you all? Share your views with me on this.
