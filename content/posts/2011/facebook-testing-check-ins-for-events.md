Facebook is testing the new feature that allows users to check-in to Facebook Places on a Facebook event page. The new feature will make Facebook places more popular and people may find it interesting to share their locations with a simple &#8216;yes-no&#8217; for the event!

A blue Check In button has appeared for some on Events pages, as in the image below. The user has to have confirmed they are Attending, the current day has to be the same as the one for the Event, and users have to be geographically close enough to the event’s Facebook Place, according to <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/facebook-adds-check-ins-to-events-2011-03" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.allfacebook.com/facebook-adds-check-ins-to-events-2011-03', 'All Facebook']);" >All Facebook</a>.

This new feature is only available on the mobile version of Facebook. Ah, so all people who are enjoying their Facebook on mobiles will love this feature. What about you ? Share your view with me.
