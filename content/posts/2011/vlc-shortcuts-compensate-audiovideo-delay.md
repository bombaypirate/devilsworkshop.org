One of the most irritating part while watching a movie on your computer is the delay between the audio/video streams! I see many friends often downloading a different print of the same movie. That&#8217;s a lot of work for most broadband users in India and many other countries.

But if you are using the VLC media player, then you can simply synchronize audio/video using keyboard shortcuts **&#8220;f&#8221;** and **&#8220;g&#8221;** as highlighted in the screenshot below. After some trial and error you will get the characters&#8217; lip-synced.

On Windows OS, if &#8220;f&#8221; and &#8220;g&#8221; do not work, try **&#8220;CTRL+F&#8221;** and **&#8220;CTRL+G&#8221;** respectively. You can also edit keyboard shortcuts by clicking on &#8220;Change&#8221; button in same window *(see following screenshot again)*
