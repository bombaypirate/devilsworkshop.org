Editing tools like Picnik are integrated into photos that are stored on Picasa.

***Pixlr – o – matic*** is an online photo editing tool from Pixlr, which has simpler feature and not as many confusing tweaks but still allows creating nice effects.

  * Visitors can upload their photos from their desktops or directly take one from their webcam. It think the webcam feature would be really useful for laptop and tablet owners.
  * Pixlr uses flash tool and has a nice light room effect. That means when the changes are made to the image, it looks like it is under a tray being processed. I do not think it serves any real purpose except it makes the editing part very cool.

  * Pixlr – o – matic has a about 86 different effects to choose and mix about.
  * Finally the photos can be saved on imm.io or back on your computer.
