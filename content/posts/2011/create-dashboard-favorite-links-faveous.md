There are a bunch of tools to save links for later viewing, Read It Later, Instapaper and many more.

Faveous is a new webapp similar to Instapaper but with a different approach, here are it’s features.

## Features Of Faveous

  * You can add links from various sources to Faveous, namely YouTube (liked videos), Twitter (shared links,favorites), Facebook (your posts), Google Reader (your starred/liked items) and many more.

  * To organize the posts, you can tag or filter or even favorite them.
  * The search feature is pretty neat and results are relevant too.
  * By default your Faveous page is public with a customized URL, if you want you can make the page private.
  * Faveous also provides a RSS feed of your links, just click on the RSS icon on the right of search bar. Initially, the RSS feed is partial but you can make it into a full feed using <a href="http://fulltextrssfeed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fulltextrssfeed.com/', 'Full Text RSS Feed']);" >Full Text RSS Feed</a>.
  * You can also share the posts from Faveous to Facebook and Twitter.
  * They also provide a bookmarklet and a few browser extensions (Chrome/Firefox) which you can get from their <a href="http://www.faveous.com/tools/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.faveous.com/tools/', 'Tools page']);" >Tools page</a>.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros: **As I said, Faveous can retrieve your favorited tweets from your twitter account, once it has retrieved them you can tell it to automatically un-favorite them. If you were using Instapaper previously, you can import your Instapaper archives to Faveous.

**Cons: **Instapaper transforms all the saved links into readable (plain text) format while Faveous still doesn’t have this feature. Faveous is pretty slow when it comes to retrieving the content from selected sources.

### Getting The Invitation

Faveous is in private beta and you can’t sign up unless and until you get a invite code. To get the invitation, all you need to do is, tweet about the site using the *Pay with a Tweet* app (you need to sign in to your Twitter account and authorize it) on the invitations page.
