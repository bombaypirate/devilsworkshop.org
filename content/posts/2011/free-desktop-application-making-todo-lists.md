A couple of months ago I wrote about [Fish Memory, which allows creating and managing multiple &#8216;To Do&#8221; lists][1]. There is a problem with such to-do list websites. The problem is you always need to be connected to the internet and also access them through a browser.

Most times desktop applications to make &#8216;to-do lists&#8217; are a litte complicated and usually not free. Thankfully I came across <a href="http://www.doominow.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.doominow.com/', 'Doominow']);" >Doominow</a>, which is a simple desktop application to make to-do lists.

## <a href="http://www.doominow.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.doominow.com/', 'Doominow To-Do List']);" >Doominow To-Do List</a> Features

  * Just download the application from the website and start adding to-do tasks.
  * The software is simple and light and does not have too many complexities.
  * It is an Adobe air application which obviously makes it compatible with all platforms including Linux.

### Why I recommend Doominow?

I like using this application because it is lightweight and uncomplicated. Most To-Do applications try to have complicated features and that takes the simplicity out of it.

I wish that the software had a way to sync on the cloud, that would be useful for people using two different computers.

Try out Doomi &#8211; To Do Lists and drop in your comments.
