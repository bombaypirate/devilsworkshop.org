A few weeks ago, [Google Plus started showing the verified sign][1], to show that a particular Google+ account of a famous person is the real deal. But it has no way at of looking up interesting users with Google Plus.

Twitter has a search function which allows searching for trending topics which at the moment Google Plus lacks. This makes it difficult to run into interesting Google+ users from different niche.

***Recommended Users***, offers a solution but hosting an unofficial directory of famous Google Plus accounts.

[<img class="wp-image-51097" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/09/Google_plus_recommend_thumb.png" alt="Google_plus_recommend" width="570" height="665" border="0" />][2]

The categories are many and a simple click shows a list of related Google+ accounts. One of the best parts of this directory, is it has more than 24 categories.

Next time if you are wondering who are the really interesting people on Google Plus, who are writing about food or web designing, then give <a href="http://www.recommendedusers.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.recommendedusers.com', 'Recommended Users']);" >Recommended Users</a> a try.

Do drop in your comments.
