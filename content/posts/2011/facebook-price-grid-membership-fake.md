Another rumor spreading on Facebook is via Facebook statuses that you have to update a status that Facebook is paid now, but if you update this status it will be free for you. That status is:

> <h6 data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1}">
>   FACEBOOK JUST RELEASED THEIR PRICE GRID FOR MEMBERSHIP. $9.99 PER MONTH FOR GOLD MEMBER SERVICES, $6.99 PER MONTH FOR SILVER MEMBER SERVICES, $3.99 PER MONTH FOR BRONZE MEMBER SERVICES, FREE IF YOU COPY AND PASTE THIS MESSAGE BEFORE MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. WHEN YOU SIGN ON TOMORROW MORNING YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR PAYMENT INFO&#8230;IT IS OFFICIAL IT WAS EVEN ON THE NEWS. FACEBOOK WILL START CHARGING DUE TO THE NEW PROFILE CHANGES. IF YOU COPY THIS ON YOUR WALL YOUR ICON WILL TURN BLUE AND FACEBOOK WILL BE FREE FOR YOU. PLEASE PASS THIS MESSAGE ON IF NOT YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE DELETED IF YOU DO NOT PAY
> </h6>

Well let us tell you that all these information are fake and Facebook is free and will remain free even after the launch of its newer version. So there nothing like a paid Facebook membership as there&#8217;s no official information regarding the same. Also it&#8217;s not possible to make Facebook paid, if they do so most of the users will stop using it as they don&#8217;t like it personally and they login just to check what their friends are up to. So be cool for the moment and enjoy Facebook for free without updating any useless statuses. ðŸ˜‰
