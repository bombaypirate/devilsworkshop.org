I end up using social media. This rise in social media has led to the notion that email might be dead in the near future.

Here is a infographic by <a href="http://www.visiblegains.com/is-email-dead/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.visiblegains.com/is-email-dead/', 'visiblegains']);" >visiblegains</a> showing how Email is alive and kicking along with growing every year. Which is true for me too, as on an overall basis, I use email a lot more than ever.

There were 107 trillion emails sent in the past year, that is 3.3 million emails per second. Even if email is well and alive, on the downside a massive 45% of all email is spam.
