I don’t doubt if you already know a [Firefox add-on][1] to download all videos of a user or a playlist to your PC, however I am sharing 3 software tools which works independent of any browser.

## JDownloader

**(+) **I am not sure if the “J” was inspired by Java which is even its development platform, I am atleast sure that it will help you to download videos on any Operating system from not just YouTube but even public file hosts like *Rapidshare** ***and *Megaupload * even you not subscribed to their premium services. It even bypasses the need to enter a captcha manually. It also supports download Resume function.

**(-) **The interface seems to be somewhat “*not instantaneous*” and heavy on CPU. This is probably because of it’s built platform is Java, and this is typical of Java-built software.

## Free YouTube Download

**(+) **This looks neat and simple. No menus, no add-ons to shuffle with. Directly paste your video, playlist or channel url and it fetches the complete list for you to start downloading in any of the major formats.

**(-)** Only MP4, AVI and FLV formats are available. Many other important formats are not covered.

## aTube Catcher

(+) This one is fantastic, though you must go to *Tools menu –> YouTube* to download multiple videos from a user or channel. It is not just for YouTube, but it lets you download from a wide range of services, <a href="http://atube-catcher.dsnetwb.com/get-video-software-windows-home/content/banco-datos-List-supported-sites-public-general.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atube-catcher.dsnetwb.com/get-video-software-windows-home/content/banco-datos-List-supported-sites-public-general.html', 'mentioned here']);" target="_blank">mentioned here</a>. However what other software cannot compete is its Turbo Download which offers upto 600% faster speeds. Also, it lets you search & directly download MP3 or Videos directly within the software. Offers almost all formats for videos and music.

(-) Found few bugs which even you may experience while using it.
