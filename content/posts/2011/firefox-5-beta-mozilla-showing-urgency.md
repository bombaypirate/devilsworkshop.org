Firefox 4 took an eternity in development and in my opinion it was probably 6 months too late. Six months in the tech world is a lot of time. When it comes to browsers the growth of Firefox was being thwarted thanks to Chrome churning out newer updates so often, that they stopped announcing them.

## Firefox Beta Features

  * There is added support for CSS animations .
  * Previously the Do-not-Track header preference has been moved to increased viewing area in the browser.
  * It also claims to have improved standards for HTML5, canvas, JavaScript.
  * The big new change is with support for switching Firefox development channel. Just go to your Help > About Firefox and we see the option to switch development channel.

### Firefox is finally waking up to faster updates!

When I started writing on this blog, way back in late 2009, there was talk of how Firefox 4 will change things. It’s final version was released in 2011 March. That was just too much time for a new version.

Chrome managed to keep gaining momentum and other than some specific add-ons, a lot of people do not find any reason to continue with Firefox when compared to Chrome.

With faster updates, it will probably push the developer community around Firefox browser into activity which might lead to better momentum.
