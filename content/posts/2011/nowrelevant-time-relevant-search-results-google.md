I do not need to really go on about Google search, but one place it lacks a little is showing relevant search results from a perspective of time. NowRelevant search results is a search engine which shows relevant results from the past 2 weeks.

  * When you enter a keyword for search results, the results are given from only links to content from only the past 2 weeks.
  * We can further tweak the number of days we want the search results to be relevant.
  * Relevant results are very useful if you are searching for something dated and especially if you are looking to read about something which is current.

### Where NowRelevants scores over Google!

Google is where the big bucks are for all SEO experts. This means that a lot of people spend a lot of time making their content rank high on Google. In NowRelevant search as the results are relevant upto only 2 weeks, it makes a good resource to look up some content that is current and not just ranked high. Also content farms will not really bother trying to list on a service which only looks up only content created over 14 days. ðŸ˜‰
