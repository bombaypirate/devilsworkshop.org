Yes, in this social media world you can effectively irritate many people on Facebook just be doing a certain things. Here they are ðŸ˜›

  * **Put different image** : Imagine when you have put a totally different person&#8217;s photograph as your profile photo. ðŸ˜€ Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-secure-login-and-picture-captcha/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-secure-login-and-picture-captcha/', 'social captcha']);" >social captcha</a> will be a pain then! Some people love to irritate their friends like this.
  * **Spam your friends** : Spams like look <a href="http://fbknol.com/scam-alert-stay-profile-stalkers-application/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/scam-alert-stay-profile-stalkers-application/', 'who viewed your profile']);" >who viewed your profile</a> and all, when you click on these spams they are displayed on your wall letting other people click on it and <a href="http://fbknol.com/dont-click-on-account-verification-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/dont-click-on-account-verification-facebook/', 'spread the spam']);" >spread the spam</a>. You should always be extra careful in clicking!
  * **Let your personal stuff out** : Believe me there are some people who <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-photo-feature-finally/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-photo-feature-finally/', 'puts snaps on Facebook']);" >puts snaps on Facebook</a> that should not be made public. I wonder why does that happen ? I do get irritated on such people.
  * **Repeat everything from Twitter** : Common this one thing I do not like, when I am following you on twitter then I do not need same updates on my Facebook wall. Don&#8217;t clutter me!
  * **Games all the time** : Game updates like barn raising, credits, extra dish from Cafe world, sometimes such updates leave no stones unturned in torturing you! Play the games but please not so much. ðŸ˜›

I find such things really irritating. What do you think ? Share your views with me.
