Two days back, we told you <a title="Permanent Link to How to remove/block unwanted applications on Facebook" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/remove-block-unwanted-applications-facebook/" rel="bookmark">How to remove/block unwanted applications on Facebook</a>. But if you don&#8217;t wanna remove that application or block it and it&#8217;s annoying you by publishing useless updates on your wall just because you clicked &#8216;Grant Permission&#8217; while installing that application to your profile, here&#8217;s a solution for you.

It&#8217;s easy to revoke publishing rights of applications on Facebook. To do so, click on any post shared by that application on your profile and click on the &#8220;cross&#8221; with that application like you do while deleting a post.

There you will see four options there:

  * Remove post
  * Remove application
  * Revoke publishing rights
  * Report post or spam

Out of four, click on the third option i.e &#8220;Revoke publishing rights&#8221; for that application.

After that it will ask for your confirmation, click &#8220;Revoke&#8221; to confirm. Now that application will not be able to post updates automatically to your wall in future.
