Over the past week, I have followed the “Wall Street Journal” which apparently reported a breach in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ', 'NASDAQ network']);" >NASDAQ network</a>, however it was maintained that the hackers didn’t touch the Trading platform nor did they steal any customer information.

However it has now been confirmed by the company that owns the 2nd largest Securities Market that its network was hacked including a platform called “Directors Desk” which lets the management of various companies share confidential data among each other.

The Law-enforcement agencies are presently investigating the entire matter, however it’s been said around the hackers are probably trying for something bigger which could potentially damage the stock market network ultimately aimed at making high monetary benefits. This is not just an issue which can be ignored as hackers are possibly able to get access to “real” data which means a lot of money is at stake.

Do post your comments on the future of electronic communications where even such big entities like NASDAQ are not 100% safe.
