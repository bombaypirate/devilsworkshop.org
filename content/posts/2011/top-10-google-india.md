### Indian Search Trends

  * Amongst the top 10 fastest rising search queries, three are about movies, one about a celebrity. Two queries are related to sports.
  * Facebook and Google+ also are in the list. This means a lot of internet users in India are searching for information related entertainment, sports and social media.
  * Amongst the most search query, it is surprising why so many people search for Facebook, Gmail, YouTube and other websites on Google search.
  * I wonder if that is because people are using Google as an address bar or if more of them are using Chrome and end up searching by name the website they want to reach from the address bar itself.

Interestingly in both lists, nothing that relates to online shopping shows up except in the case of Indian Railways, where people are searching for ways to book tickets online.

The search trends do show that a lot of people who use Google are young, urban Indians who might not be more inclined to search for sports and entertainment and not news and current events.

What are your views? What do you think you searched for most on Google this year? Do drop in your comments.
