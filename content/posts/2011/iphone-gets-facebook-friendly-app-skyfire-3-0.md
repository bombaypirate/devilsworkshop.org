Skyfire Labs has introduced a Facebook friendly application for iPhone.

The latest Skyfire 3.0 includes the Facebook Like button with which the user can simply ‘like’ or ‘unlike’ the page. Moreover, this new version will also support more videos based on Flash across different websites.

Skyfire 3.0 offers like the iPhone users can view what their Facebook friends and contacts view mostly at any website. One can also see the recommendations from friends. The app has an option called ‘Skyfire OneTouch Search’ where the user just needs to enter a single search term and choose between Google, Video or Wikipedia with a single touch with no need of navigating to different websites.

The iPhone users can easily download the app from the App Store. This application seems promising. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Wow, I wish I had iPhone and enjoy it.
