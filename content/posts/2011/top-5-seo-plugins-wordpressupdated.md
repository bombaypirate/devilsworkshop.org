Some blogs have good quality and unique blog posts, but they don&#8217;t have a higher page rank on search engines. Why? Maybe because they are not taking Search Engine Optimization seriously or don&#8217;t want to waste time in SEO as they can utilize that time to write quality posts.

Sometimes SEO takes away precious time from bloggers and they end up with huge traffic, but no content. Many people suggest new bloggers to first fill up your blog with content and then take some time for Search Engine Optimization and Traffic Building. But it becomes tiring for new bloggers.

The best way to handle this job is to leave it to Plugins. If you use WordPress, then you might be knowing that you&#8217;ve plenty of plugins to choose from. Here is a list of 5 best plugins which will help you rank higher on Search Engines without needing you to do something.

If you&#8217;re here reading about SEO, then you might be knowing what sitemaps are and what are their value. Creating a sitemap everytime you post a new article is tiring. To make it automatic, you can use Google XML Sitemap which updates itself and helps Google and other search engines to index your blog faster. This is a must have plugin for both new and existing bloggers.

What if someone is redirected to your site from a search engine finds that the post he has been redirected to is missing or doesn&#8217;t exist? By Default, he will find a 404 Error stating that the page doesn&#8217;t exist. By using this plugin, you can easily show them a good Missing Page and also show them some related content on your blog(to the term or URL).

You can redirect traffic to your blog using your images too. This plugin automatically adds ALT and Title making your Images more relevant to search. Not only it adds the title and alt function for the images, but it also optimizes them for better search rankings.

Despite of all these you need quality content rich with keywords relevant to Search Queries because &#8216;Content Is King&#8217; and you all know that. Drop in your feedback through comments.
