It all started with Gmail, when it was launched, Google allowed people to use and create a new Gmail account only via invitations.

With Google Wave, it was the same and people clamored for invitations from friends and family along with some websites who offered invitations.

## How Twitter reacted to Google Plus Invites!

Twitter is usually a good place to look up how much buzz a certain brand, product is creating. This is because, Twitter is open and not private at all.

According to <a href="http://trendistic.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://trendistic.com', 'Trendistic']);" >Trendistic</a>, About %1 of all tweets across almost 24 hours on Twitter had the word “Google” included in it. If Twitter gets about 190 million tweets per day, hence roughly about 1.9 million tweets had the word Google in it.

This is a remarkable way to increase word of mouth publicity but it has its pitfalls. When Google Wave was invite only based, it got a lot of negative publicity and that too spread word of mouth. This is markedly different from Apple, which never speak about a new product and lets the media do all the speculating which ends up being free publicity.

More about Google+ later when I land up an invite. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Do drop in your views and comments.
