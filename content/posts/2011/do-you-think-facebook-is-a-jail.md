We do come across pictures of  Facebook that are funny and intriguing in some way or the other. Just like this one I found on my wall posted by one of my friend.

Funny, right! Facebook is getting more and more addictive. Some people do call it a jail. We sit at one place, keep refreshing our profile pages (though you don&#8217;t need to refresh it a lot as  Facebook is testing real time comments <a href="http://www.chaaps.com/facebook-testing-real-time-comments-for-status-updates.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chaaps.com/facebook-testing-real-time-comments-for-status-updates.html', 'Source']);" >Source</a> ) , write on each other&#8217;s walls.. and many more. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

There are people ignoring their real lives, the responsibilities (<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-game-kills-child/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-game-kills-child/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>) , scams increasing (<a href="http://fbknol.com/scam-alert-stay-profile-stalkers-application/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/scam-alert-stay-profile-stalkers-application/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>) , several pokes from friends we never have met. I do not mind Facebooking but everything within a limit sounds good to me. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

What do you think? How addicted are you on Facebook? Share your views with me.
