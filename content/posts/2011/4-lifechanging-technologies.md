I was thinking about the time when I had to go to a cyber-cafe to access Internet at a pretty high cost, that too time-based. I even switched to another cyber-cafe as it was using &#8216;ISDN&#8217; technology. And today if you think about Internet and Netbooks, about iPhone & iPad, everything has changed so much, can be termed as Life-changing.

Now, I am going to discuss 4 similar Life-changing technologies of the present decade.

## USB 3.0 (Superspeed USB)

What about USB providing 10 times the speed it provides now? In absolute terms, USB 3.0 will provide a speed upto 4.8 gigabits per second as compared to the present speed of upto 480 megabits per second. Woooah, isn’t that super cool?

## Wireless Power Transmission

Oh! Are you not much impressed with the idea of Power without wires, or are you just nervous about the effects it may cause to your bones! The research for this exciting & ‘life-changing’ technology is going at MIT and Intel. In just about 7-8 years, you may be using this probably to charge your Laptop at the Airport <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Mobile ‘Assistant’

With the pace people are buying mobile phones, it is not long when almost everyone will have a Personal assistant. With software sector booming and hardware evolving to provide users the best, things have not really been like the past. People already use their mobile phones as assistants to find their way, locate themselves, just speak instead of talking and lot more.

## 128-bit Computing

Are you still using a 32-bit computer but even aware of a 64-bit processor? A 64-bit computer (Windows) allows your system to have upto 192 GB RAM due to its enhanced addressing ability. What&#8217;s interesting is the 128-bit processors which are under evolution. Don’t you think these are life-changing?
