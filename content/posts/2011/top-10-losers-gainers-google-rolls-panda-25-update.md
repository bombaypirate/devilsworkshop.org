Google has updated its search algorithm. Usually it does not announce new updates but to fight the menace of &#8216;content farms&#8217; it started rolling out the, now famous or infamous (depending on search traffic being lost or increased) Panda update.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-10-losers-gainers-google-rolls-panda-25-update/google_panda_25/" rel="attachment wp-att-46088"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46088" title="Google Panda Update" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/Google_panda_25.png" alt="" width="418" height="189" /></a>

It has been confirmed by <a href="http://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/2011/10/01/google-panda-usa-update-2-5/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/2011/10/01/google-panda-usa-update-2-5/', 'Search Metrics']);" >Search Metrics</a>, that new Panda 2.5 update has been rolled out in the past week. It has also compiled a list of website which have lost the biggest after this update.

Interesting the majority of sites losing out because of Panda 2.5 are mainly movie gossip sites along with some medicine related websites.

##  YouTube is Highest Gainer!

YouTube shows up as highest gainer after the Panda 2.5 roll-out. This can be quite controversial as YouTube is a Google product and some might think of this update as something that favors Google products.

The first Panda update was sometime in February and after that we have had over 6 more updates. This shows that every 5-7 weeks a new update is done to Google Search Algorithm. Expect the next update sometime towards the end of November 2011.
