Adobe briefed its partners about moving away from Flash for mobile phone OS with this quote.

> We will no longer adapt Flash Player for mobile devices to new browser, OS version or device configurations.

This basically makes it possible for Adobe to feature on Apple products which have famously resisted Flash players on their browsers, claiming they were from the PC-era and did not fit into the post-PC era. This was supported in an article by <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/', 'Steve Jobs where he made his views public on Flash']);" >Steve Jobs where he made his views public on Flash</a>.

## Did Apple kill Flash on Mobiles?

No. Apple might have started the trend of doing away with Flash and correctly estimated that HTML5 would be used more for streaming videos and gaming. Adobe also could not exactly kill a technology that other platforms wanted. But lately with Google and even Microsoft opting to move more towards HTML5 standards for browsers on the OS for mobile phones, it was pretty much end game for Flash.

What are your views on Flash being killed off for browsers on mobile phones? Do drop in your comments.
