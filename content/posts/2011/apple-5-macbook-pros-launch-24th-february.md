It’s everywhere now.. Apple is going to launch 5 new models of the **MacBook Pros** with its latest Intel **Sandy Bridge** processors which are said to be much faster and low on eating power, courtesy <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/02/18/new-macbook-pros-likely-to-launch-on-thursday/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macrumors.com/2011/02/18/new-macbook-pros-likely-to-launch-on-thursday/', 'MacRumors']);" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>. This is somehow not usual for Apple to launch on a Thursday unlike this time being the birthday of someone very important, guess who? Well it is no other than Steven Paul Jobs (Steve Jobs) who is the CEO of Apple Inc.
