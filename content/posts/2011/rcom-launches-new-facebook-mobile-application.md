Reliance and Facebook announced the launch of a new Facebook mobile app exclusively available for Reliance subscribers in India for a 3 month period. Finally! I always thought why doesn&#8217;t Reliance do something like this.

[<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6331" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/facebook-logo4-600x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="225" />][1]

This new app will be available for all Java powered mobile phones. You do not need a smart phone for such purpose. The new Facebook app for Java-powered feature phones will be made available for most of the popular handset models in India. Reliance customers who are also Facebook users can now stay connected on their mobile phones without having to upgrade to a smart phone.

Reliance will be the first and only operator in India to offer this app.  Reliance is providing a special promotional offer where all users can enjoy this app free for three months without incurring any data charges.1. This app provides a ‘smartphone like’ experience on feature phones by showing features like viewing photos, synchronizing your local phone contacts with your Facebook friends and  Facebook login to third-party services within the app, such as news, sports, games, and weather.

The app will be available for Reliance Communications customers to download without any extra data charges from R World on their Reliance phones by typing &#8211; <a href="http://wap.rworld.co.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wap.rworld.co.in/', 'http://wap.rworld.co.in']);" >http://wap.rworld.co.in</a>. Did you try this on your phone ? If yes then share your experience with me and if not then try it soon and let me know. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
