Android is one of the worldâ€™s most popular operating system for mobile phones. But unlike iOS, which also supports syncing of apps across other Apple devices, there is no Android OS for a PC. To use your Android Apps on Windows, Bluestack App player is a boon.

It is a software which comes with 10 preloaded Android apps and neatly works on your laptop or PC running Windows OS.

  * The BlueStacks Apps when installed, are pre-loaded with 10 free apps. It usually shows up on the right hand corner of your desktop by default.
  * Users can install upto 26 more apps and run them, getting a feel of how Android apps behave without actually using Android.
  * The best part is users can synchronize their apps from Android phone to Windows PC with BlueStacks Cloud Connect.

It is a great way to synchronize and use Android Apps on Windows, which was not really possible. If you have a Windows computer and Android phone or tablet, then this software is a must.

The video below explains the features of BlueStacks quite well.
