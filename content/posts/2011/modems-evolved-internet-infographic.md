I still remember my dial-up modem from more than 10 years ago. Back in those days, the speed that modem could handle was 33.6 kbps. Simply checking your email would take 10 full minutes and uploading a photo album could actually end up driving your phone bill up. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The internet has evolved and so have the modems that are used. Most people always think of the internet, when they hear the word &#8216;modem&#8217; but modems came into existence a good 20 odd years before the birth of the internet.
