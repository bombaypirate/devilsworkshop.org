I am usually very particular about the people I follow on Twitter, that is because I want to make sure that I can actually read my Twitter timeline without the need of using lists to filter out the noise.

This means I tend not to follow people who update a 100 times a day. ðŸ˜€

An online tool, that I came across called ***twtrland*** gives me a nice analysis to decide if I should follow that person on Twitter.

  * Just enter the Twitter handle of the account and we get neatly organized data about that Twitter account.
  * Check details on how many tweets are sent per day, how many of them are retweeted and how many times there are retweets.
  * Also a pie diagram on the right, shows what percentage of tweets show links, mentions, replies and plain tweets. This might give you a good idea on if the account is interactive of just simply tweeting out links. ðŸ˜‰

If you are like me and like to keep your Twitter account clean and very particular about the accounts your follow, you might like to check ***twtrland***. If want to clean up the accounts you follow on Twitter, you might want to look up these [free online tools][3].
