Many times when we share a link with our friends, we actually are impressed not by the entire article but only a few points or just a paragraph. While highlighting some text we can bring to notice certain important points or even faults in an article.

**Awesome Highlighter** is a nice online tool that allows users to highlight text on just about any webpage and share it with friends.

  * Just type in the URL of the page you want to use the highlighter on and let the page load up.
  * Once done start highlighting the important part of the article or post. Users can choose different colours to highlight which might be useful with different website and their designs.
  * One you are done, click on the “Done” button and we get a URL for sharing the webpage with the appropriate text highlighted. It also allows sharing through Twitter, Facebook or bookmarking the highlighted page on Delicious.

Next time you want to bring to notice some text on a webpage, use Awesome Highlighter. It is simple and does not need registration. Do drop in your comments.
