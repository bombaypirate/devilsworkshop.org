My first language is not English, it is Marathi. This means I tend to think in a different language and blog in a different one. While writing posts, I feel stuck at times when it comes to articulating something. I like  <a href="http://www.netspeak.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.netspeak.org', 'Netspeak']);" >Netspeak</a> which has billions of phrases and tips on how to use them.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Netspeak_how_to" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/Netspeak_how_to_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Netspeak_how_to" width="577" height="447" />][1]

For example, I typed in “How to ?”. The question mark is then replaced with other common words which are used.  It also shows how commonly used they are on the internet (see image above).

**Netspeak** also gives example of usage when you enter in a phrase. This is a great way to make sure if the phrase you are using is relevant.

Do try out Netspeak and drop in your comments and views.
