With web-browsing just not the only thing in today’s Internet world, there are a lot of interesting applications developed to keep users busy with the product. Just like Facebook, Google Chrome offers 1000s of applications including interesting Games. However these apps are just random websites and installation is not done to your hard-disk. I have tested few of them and here’s the list.

As the name suggests, this is an online Chess game. The Game has three difficulty levels, you can even undo your moves till unlimited depths. The best feature is that the game do not needs an active Internet connection. This is definitely worth playing.

This one is quite witchy… When I started playing, there were three people boiling something (as in real witches do in movies) and there were balls coming up which needs to be placed in similar pairs to create enough spiders. You do have a time limit. Worth playing if you have lots of time to pass. In fact I made 34555 in my first attempt itself.

Do I need to introduce this famous game by Zynga which has been highly popular on Facebook as well. The game insists on building Mafias and your friends joining you to increase your power.

There are lots of balloons you need to prick in pairs to get the gifts stuck in between to the floor. Interesting and addictive game. My score on first attempt was 690. Not that bad, huh!

Though I do not know how to play Golf even in gaming, I tried out this and found this too much interesting as the graphics and reality is worth appreciation. However the initial loading time was pretty high when compared to other games. I made a penalty score of 330 on my first attempt. (I told you I do not know how to play Golf, though there is a tutorial in the game!
