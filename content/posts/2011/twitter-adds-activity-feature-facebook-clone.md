## Will Twitter be a Facebook clone?

For most people using Twitter through their Phone apps, or other web app – this change will have no effect. But for people using Twitter on the web, the experience will become a lot more social and concentrated on what your network is doing. This will be a lot different from the current scenario where Twitter feed often behaves like an information fire-hose about the latest happenings.

Along with Twitter’s new image sharing feature, I wonder if ‘activity’ feature will impact Twitter’s uniqueness, or are they also feeling the heat from Google Plus?
