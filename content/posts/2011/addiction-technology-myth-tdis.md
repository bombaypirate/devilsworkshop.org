We claim smoking is an addiction but we often forget to tag technology as an addiction. Why would we do that after all? Just like a smoker never wants to talk about his addiction, we all being addicted to Technology would never do the same. We all know, living without technology and “tech products” is like living without cigarette for a smoker, a weird though realistic comparison.

Most of you would comment “don’t you think our lives have been made so easy and fast?”.

What I am going to discuss is a fact chart which is just not about the disadvantages but even the advantages of using technology.

## The good effects

  * Creation of new jobs in IT and ITES sector and other affiliated sectors.
  * Cost effectiveness due to increase in technological advancement including use of faster processes due to IT and hence increase in production.
  * It has helped in reducing cultural gap among people due to it’s global reach and since it provides an equal platform for everyone to interact and discuss their views.

## The bad effects

  * Creation of new problems like wrist pain and neck pain and other injuries thanks to hours on a computer.
  * Stress related issues because of being online and available 24/7 which has lead to issues like depression and emotional imbalance.
  * Mental stress and tiredness has become a commonly found gift. People actually need to visit a doctor to be told that they need to relax and take time out.

What I am trying to convey here is basically focussing on a balanced use of technology and not just throwing anything off your lives. I would even like to share the source of inspiration behind writing this article, it is a short incident which happened at a food joint in my city commonly visited by me and my friends.

One of my friends started asking me how to de-activate his Messaging (SMS) pack for his Mobile connection and ofcourse I asked him the reason. His reply was – “the regulating authority for Communications in India (TRAI) has reduced the daily SMS limit under the Free Packs to just 100 while earlier it used to be 500”. The confused soul in me questioned him back – “So, what’s the big problem?” to which he replied – “100 is too less for me as I send atleast 250 messages a day”.

What could be my reaction, anybody wants to guess here? I was watching him with astonishment and wondering if my friend who seems perfectly normal was in fact a technology addict.

So what are you thoughts on being addicted to technology? Is it something acceptable or is technology addiction going to be a big problem in the future? Do let me know through your comments.
