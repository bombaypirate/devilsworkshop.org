Google has often talked a lot about the cloud. Store everything you want online and access it anywhere. This all sounds fantastic most times until the moment something goes wrong. The popular blogging platform Blogger.com is down.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Blogger_down" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/Blogger_down_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Blogger_down" width="570" height="380" />][1]

This service has been down for a few hours and this probably shakes confidence of people in Cloud services. It seems they are removing posts temporarily, which were created after  7.37 AM PDT, 11th May 2011.

Here is a quote from <a href="http://status.blogger.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://status.blogger.com/', 'Blogger Status']);" >Blogger Status</a>:

> To get Blogger back to normal, all posts since 7:37am PDT on Weds, 5/11 have been temporarily removed. We expect everything to be back to normal soon. Sorry for the delay.

A few months ago, Gmail outage had also caused concern with Google users. Stay tuned to this post and I will update it when blogger is available again.
