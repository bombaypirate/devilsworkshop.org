Another new Scam hits Facebook. This one says it can tell you who are your profile stalkers. Yeah right who doesn&#8217;t want to know that?

We all do, we do want to know <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-identify-a-spam-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-identify-a-spam-on-facebook/', 'who visited our profiles']);" >who visited our profiles</a>, <a href="http://fbknol.com/new-scam-how-many-times-your-profile-was-viewed/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/new-scam-how-many-times-your-profile-was-viewed/', 'how many times was it visited']);" >how many times was it visited</a>, who visits regularly or in Facebook dictionary who is the profile stalker. Somebody has to put an end on all this, please!

I saw a friend&#8217;s update on my Facebook wall. It said that she saw her Facebook stalkers and you can see yours. On clicking that link it took me to a new page that says this is a verified application of Facebook and so many people like it. Just see the image below.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/scam-alert-stay-profile-stalkers-application/facebook-stalker/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/scam-alert-stay-profile-stalkers-application/facebook-stalker/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-5285"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5285" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Facebook-stalker.png" alt="" width="600" height="320" /></a>

On clicking **enter **it asks you to allow the application. One the application is allowed, it takes you a new page. Some software has to be downloaded and all. Well, firstly I don&#8217;t believe in downloading something like this and secondly this is all a scam.

As you can see in the image below, it just tricks the users into clicking the link. There is no logic behind all this. These scams are increasing like hell. Everyday I see a new one appearing. If it keeps sending this message on your friends wall then you can try removing it also (<a href="http://fbknol.com/solved-how-to-remove-annoying-spam-messages-from-your-facebook-profile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/solved-how-to-remove-annoying-spam-messages-from-your-facebook-profile/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>).

I always suggest you not to click or fall for such things. I click on these because I have to see if its working or not and tell you all. But, why do you have to click it? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Share your views with me.
