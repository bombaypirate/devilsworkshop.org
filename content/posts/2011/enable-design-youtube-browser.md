**Editor&#8217;s Note:** YouTube has now made the [new design available to all users][1] so this hack is not needed anymore.

* * *

Lately Google has gone on a re-design frenzy from Google search, [Gmail][2], Google Reader and more. This redesign push from Google has started after it introduced its social offering Google+.

So a new design for YouTube was not exactly surprising. At the moment Google has not officially made the new design available for all users but there is a workaround <a href="https://plus.google.com/117596712775912423303/posts/K9bQqW9LRci" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/117596712775912423303/posts/K9bQqW9LRci', 'shared byÂ Moritz Tolxdorff']);" >shared byÂ Moritz Tolxdorff</a>.

If you are using Chrome or Firefox, you can simply paste a code into your browser&#8217;s developer&#8217;s console which creates a cookie for YouTube making the new design available. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## New Design of YouTube on Chrome and Firefox

  * Visit the YouTube website on your Chrome or Firefox browser.
  * Now open the Developer Tools Console by clicking on &#8220;**Ctrl + Shift + J&#8221;** keys for Chrome. In case you are using Firefox use the **&#8220;Ctrl + Shift + K&#8221;** keys
  * Now copy and paste the code from below and enter it into the console.
  * This will create a cookie which will allow your browser to look up YouTube in a new design.

  Try out the new design, it is quite interesting. If you want the old layout back, just clear cookies from your browser. ðŸ˜‰
