Once upon a time Lady Gaga had greatest number of fans on Facebook, no more. Eminem has surpassed her with just a small difference.

Eminem, 38, is has over half a million &#8216;likes&#8217; a day, surpassing Lady Gaga. If he continues to do so ,very soon he will be ahead of Michael Jackson fans. ðŸ˜› Wow!

Lady Gaga was at the top for 8 months on Facebook. She now hasÂ 28,856,359 fans whereas he&#8217;s got 28,864,014. There is just a small difference here. Well, just for you infoÂ President Obama has only around 15 million fans on Facebook. Ha ha !

This stat makes me feel that people follow celebrities or singers more than the real big personalities. What are your views ? Who do you like more, Lady Gaga or Eminem or Obama ? Do you think Eminem will have more fans than the legend Michael Jackson ? Share your views with me here.
