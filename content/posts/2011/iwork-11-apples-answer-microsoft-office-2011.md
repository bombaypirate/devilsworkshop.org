Apple on a launching spree [check <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/apple-5-macbook-pros-launch-24th-february/" target="_blank">MacBook Pros</a> & <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/apple-unveil-ipad-2-2nd-march/" target="_blank">iPad 2</a>], and a frustrated Microsoft puts up a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/compare/pc-vs-mac.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/compare/pc-vs-mac.aspx', 'comparison page']);" target="_blank">comparison page</a> on it’s official website. But Apple still did not officially announce the release date for it’s answer to Microsoft Office 2011.

I believe it had to release somewhere by February this year, and to be more specific, 19th February 2011 as suggested <a href="http://www.applebitch.com/2011/02/15/iwork-11-to-arrive-on-19th-february/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.applebitch.com/2011/02/15/iwork-11-to-arrive-on-19th-february/', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>. However the date has passed with rumors failing to intercept Apple&#8217;s intentions and now the rumors are growing about 2 March, 2011.

Though many users have already started using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/aug10/08-02msmacofficepr.mspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/aug10/08-02msmacofficepr.mspx', 'Office 2011 released by Microsoft']);" target="_blank">Office 2011 released by Microsoft</a> in October last year, however many are still waiting for Apple’s iWork ‘11 to set footprints to upgrade from iWork ‘09 released in January 2010. Apple will even offer  Pages, Numbers and Keynote software (similar to Word, Excel and PowerPoint) even individually to users.

*What is your opinion about this tussle between Microsoft & Apple? Do you think Mac’ lovers will go for Microsoft Office or will be patient enough for iWork to set its début? Do share your thoughts.*
