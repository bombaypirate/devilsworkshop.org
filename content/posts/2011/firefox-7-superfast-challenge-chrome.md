One reason for me to [move from Firefox to Chrome][1] was its speed and relatively being light-weight on resources.

But lately, Chrome has often become a bit of a resource hog, while Firefox which keeps pulling out new released every few weeks has become lighter and a lot faster.

Firefox 7 is now available for download.

### Features of Firefox 7

  * Firefox 7 claims to be use 20% to 30% less memory than its predecessors. That means the browser runs a lot smoothly even if many tabs are open.
  * It supports faster HTML5 animations along with many improvements to the speed of the browser.
  * It has news tools which will help developers create faster web apps that run on Firefox.

  I am not certain if it will be able to stop Chrome&#8217;s growth but it will make current users very happy. Also recently Chrome browser has had some issues with management of resources. This might give Firefox browser a good boost.
