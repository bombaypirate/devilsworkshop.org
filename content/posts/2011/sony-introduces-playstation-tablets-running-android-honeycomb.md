Sony has introduced two tablet devices which will be running on the Android 3.0 (Honeycomb). The two tablets were unveiled yesterday and might help Sony capture a market which might look for the gaming experience along with the other tablet features. The two tablets are named S1 and S2 respectively.

## Sony Tablet S1 Features

  * The S1 tablet will have 9.4 inch length. It has a single screen.
  * It will run on Nvidia Tegra 2 dual-core processor.
  * The S1 tablet will have front and back cameras. It will be running on Android 3.0.
  * The tablet will also have “Swift” web browser.
  * The S1 tablet is Playstation certified which means it will be able to run certain PS games.

## Sony Tablet S2 Features

  * The first noticeable difference is that it is a dual screen tablet.
  * The tablet folds like a book and is suitable for people looking for a tablet but more compact options which can be carried with more ease than traditional tablets.
  * The two screens will be both 5.5 inches each and will also run on Tegra 2 dual core processor.

### Video for Sony Tablets

Recently, <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/survey-tablet-users-play-games-read-ebooks/" target="_blank">Google’s AdMob had carried out a survey</a> which came up with surprising results. The results were that more people used tablets for playing games than anything else.  
While I had not included it in my <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-tablets-compete-ipad-2-2011/" target="_blank">list of 5 competitors to Apple iPad2</a>, I do feel that over time Sony might just make decent progress in the tablet device market.

I think this will ultimately come down to how good Android 3.0 in terms of performance. If Android 3.0 hits gold dust then Apple would have reasons to worry.
