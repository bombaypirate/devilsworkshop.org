“Google is God” is a quote I come across often since I became a blogger. If you are online, there is very little chance you do not know about Google or have not used the search engine. Managing several million search queries every hour effortlessly, we often take Google search engine for granted.

Today it seems the internet God, took a break giving 502 error for many users across the world. The outage has now been resolved and the search service is up and running.

A colleague (<a href="http://twitter.com/r_thakker" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/r_thakker', '@r_thakker']);" >@r_thakker</a>) pinged the site and it also confirmed the 502 error.

## Recent History of Internet Outages

Outages do probably disrupt people’s work and life, but it seems we have to learn to live with some outages. [Skype was down][3] for many users for over a day in Dec 2010. While the popular blogger service [Blogger.com, faced downtime in May 2011][4] for a few hours.

More recently, we have seen [BlackBerry services being down for almost 3 days][5].

I read some tweets suggesting that even Gmail users had faced a small downtime last night, but I could not confirm it with Google Apps returning no disruption of service at all (see image below).

When Google returned the 502 error for a while today, it might not have had a big impact but outages that last for hours or days could really hurt both customers and the company that provides the service.
