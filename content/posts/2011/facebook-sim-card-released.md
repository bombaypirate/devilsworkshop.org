Yes its true, now your new GSM cell phone will be having Facebook built-in. Gemalto has created the first SIM card including functions related to the social network.

He has managed to get Facebook running on a SIM chip, making every GSM phone a Facebook phone and bringing social networking to the simplest of handsets. A spokesperson for the social network confirmed the development via email. He said,

> We worked closely with Gemalto on their Facebook for SIM product and believe it will be another easy and affordable way for people to stay connected through Facebook on the mobile phone of their choice. Facebook for SIM creatively combines technologies from some of our existing mobile solutions that especially are attractive for people with feature phones and have limited or no data plans with a mobile operator. Through the Facebook application on the SIM card people can: Update their status and view comments on it; write on their friends wall; receive notifications; find friends on their SIM phonebook.

Regarding Facebook phone sometimes I think I have had enough, some say it will be out some deny. So well I am waiting to see the exact launch now. What do you think ? Share your views with me on this.
