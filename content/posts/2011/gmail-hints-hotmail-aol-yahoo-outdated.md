The latest public relations push by Gmail is called ‘Email Intervention’. If you visit your Gmail login page, it will show up a new feature asking users to ‘Save their friends from outdated email’. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Google is looking to tap into peer pressure from it&#8217;s happy users, to get their friends using other email services that it is time to move over to Gmail.

Check out the video below, where the presenter suggests that Gmail users should get their friends who use ‘embarrassingly out of data address’ to move over to Gmail. The video also adds that these email services were around when people still used Floppy Disks, Portable Disc Player, VHS Cassettes. This is a reference to Hotmail, Yahoo and AOL which were around since the late 90’s.

### Why is Gmail pushing so hard to get new users?

[<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36254" title="Gmail_logo_updates.png" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Gmail_logo_updates-200x200.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" />][2]Gmail is a great way for Google to get new members using its various other services. It also might indirectly give a push to Google+.

It might be poking fun at Hotmail, AOL and Yahoo as old and outdated, but honestly as a regular Gmail user, I cannot imagine moving back to the older email services and still wonder why some friends still do not use Gmail.

What are your views on Gmail? Do you have friends who still have not discovered Gmail? Do drop in your comments.
