Google Buzz is almost at the end and Google is going to close this service completely. But for all those who are currently using it or shared hundreds of posts on it then here&#8217;s a Google tool for you where you can download all your Google Buzz posts and content. This service is Google Takeout. Using this service you can export your posts, photos contacts and other Google Buzz and Google+ profile data including posts you have posted on Google Buzz.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47129" title="google takeout" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/google-takeout.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="488" />

To download all your data open the page:

*<a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1', 'http://www.google.com/takeout']);" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/takeout</a>*

Now you will see a page as shown in the screenshot above, click &#8220;CREATE ARCHIVE&#8221;. That will create a *.zip* file for all your data. Click Download to begin downloading.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-47130" title="google takeout1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/google-takeout1-600x314.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="314" />

You have to enter your password once again to begin downloading; this will download all the content in a zip file with separate folders for each one of them. This is just like <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/download-all-your-facebook-details-in-a-zip-file/" target="_blank">downloading your Facebook profile&#8217;s data</a>. This is a useful tool as Google is shutting down its Google Buzz and I don&#8217;t think that even Google+ is going to survive for long.
