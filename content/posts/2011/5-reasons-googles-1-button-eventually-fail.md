Google has made an unsuccessful foray into the social sphere with Google Buzz. It had no impact and now we have Google +1 buttons which act as a vote of confidence by users to links on Google search, YouTube and more.

I do not think this new social product from Google will succeed and here are 5 reasons I think which will lead to it’s failure.

## Google’s +1 doomed to fail?

  1. **No Originality:  
    **The +1 button seems to be very similar to Facebook’s “Like” or “Share” button. While looking up links or pages on the web we can see if your contacts have also clicked on +1 button for it. The point is if I have a Facebook account, why will I stop using the “Like” button and use “+1”?
  2. **Google Profile is not Facebook:  
    **A few geeks and die-hard Google fans are aware of Google Profiles. Beyond that not many even visit their Google Profile once a month (yours truly being one of them). So we can see all the links we like via +1s, on Google Profile. But, the fact is Google Profile is hardly anywhere close to being as interactive and fun as Facebook.
  3. **Simple Idea:  
    **When we like something on Facebook, we click on the “Like” button. We do the same with blog posts and even videos. With Google +1, there is no simplicity to it. Sure I can, +1 a video on YouTube, but I can also “Like” or “Dislike” it. So what is the exact idea behind +1 again?
  4. **Zero Awareness:  
    **People were aware of Google Buzz, because they introduced it compulsorily in all Gmail accounts. Why would people be aware of Google +1? Chances are most people will simply ignore it altogether.
  5. **More Curative than Social:  
    **The whole idea behind +1, seems to be one which will allow people to curate the good links from the bad. If that is the case, expect this feature to be misused. As I made the first point, people do not even visit their profile everyday on Google and hence might not care about clicking on +1 buttons incessantly.

People tend to stay longer on Facebook than they would anywhere else. This is the main challenge for Google. Until it, finds a way to make people stay on Google Search longer than they are now, all its social experiments will inevitably fail.
