Facebook pages are a goldmine for brand managers to really engage fans and followers daily with updates and even helping with customer service. For blogs like the one you are reading this article one, a Facebook page is a must for people to follow and look up articles.

Google+ has to have something similar to Facebook pages to compete against it. At the moment Google is allowing businesses to register with Google+ Entity profile.

It is still experimental and it will be used see the effect of brands with the Google+ experience.

If you are looking to join Google+ Entity program, register <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/rtcamp.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dFkzbnZoVXVDMkJ1dmlXbjh0Q09MS1E6MQ&ndplr=1#gid=0" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/a/rtcamp.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dFkzbnZoVXVDMkJ1dmlXbjh0Q09MS1E6MQ&ndplr=1#gid=0', 'here']);" >here</a>.

Do you think Google+ can come up with something more interesting than Facebook Pages? I guess if they allow more customizable option, it could be quite the killer idea.

Do drop in your comments.
