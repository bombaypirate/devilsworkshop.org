<img class="size-full wp-image-28737 alignnone" title="PayPal-Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Fight" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/PayPal-Reserve-Bank-of-India-RBI-Fight.png" alt="" width="595" height="187" />

This morning like all other hundred thousand Paypal users in India, I woke with an email notice from PayPal regarding upcoming changes to User Agreement in India.Â Like on theÂ [previous occasion][1], this time as well, allÂ inconvenience is sponsored by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

As expected, this announcement rose many questions and I guess I can answer some of them correctly. As I am no legal or economic expert, it will be unwise to count on my conclusions which I have drawn after reading <a href="https://www.paypal-apac.com/india/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.paypal-apac.com/india/', 'this officialÂ announcement page from PayPal']);" >this officialÂ announcement page from PayPal</a>.

## Things that will change:

### **#1. You won&#8217;t be able to accept a single transaction of more than $500**

****You need to ask client to break a bigger transaction into multiple transaction not exceeding $500 each. This will add communication overhead plus will causeÂ inconvenience to your client. &#8220;inconvenience to end client&#8221; is the worst part I feel.

Another downside is, paypal payments that we receive by automated means like from ad-networks, affiliate networks, how will youÂ ask them (machines)Â to break bigger payments into multiple ones? No answer yet!

If you are running an e-commerce site with PayPal payment gateway integration, then your customers won&#8217;t be able to &#8220;checkout via Paypal&#8221; if total payable amount exceeds $500. This can be solved by using alternate payment gateway like <a href="http://rt.cx/2co" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.cx/2co', '2Checkout']);" rel="nofollow">2Checkout</a>. 2Checkout allows end-customers to pay via Paypal. I hope this solves the problem as 2Checkout will act as (American) middleman between PayPal and You (Indian users/merchant) ðŸ˜‰

### **#2. You must withdraw Paypal balance to Indian bank account within 7-days**

As changes to PayPal userÂ agreementÂ for India will also ban Indian users from using PayPal balance to buy goods & services online, you anyway do not have any reason to keep Paypal balance in PayPal account itself. So keep withdrawing!

Two things that are unclear about this 7-days limit are:

  1. What will happen if for some reason you cannot access your account for 7-days? Will Paypal do automatic withdrawal to Indian bank account OR return payments to original senders? Or justÂ forfeit the pending PayPal balance!
  2. PayPal charges INR 50 if you are withdrawing less than INR 7000. This 7-days limit may force you to withdraw smaller amounts even if you don&#8217;t need them in India.

As per <a href="http://www.vinsar.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vinsar.net/', 'Vinsar&#8217;s']);" >Vinsar&#8217;s</a> [comment][2], it has been confirmed by PayPal support team that if we do not Â withdraw within 7 days, account balance in our PayPal account will beÂ withdrawn automatically to our bank account. Also, if you PayPal account balance is below INR 7000, PayPal will deduct INR 50 automatically from your account at the time of this &#8220;automated&#8221; withdrawal.

### #3. You cannot use Paypal &#8220;balance&#8221; to buy goods & services online

Please note the quotes word &#8211; &#8220;balance&#8221;. New changes doesn&#8217;t mean buying through PayPal option has gone forever for you.Â It only means, you cannot use PayPal balance.

If you have any credit card linked to your PayPal account, you will be able to buy stuff online via PayPal. Only thing, purchase amount will be deducted through your CreditCard and not PayPal balance.

This only means &#8211; you will loose money in currency-conversion twice! This also means banks will make earn more from theirÂ foreignÂ currencyÂ conversion service.

Practically, this will affect all PayPal users without any credit card on their account. You may try using [Virtual Credit Card][3] to overcome this problem!

## Why is this happening?

**For point #1**, RBI has instructed PayPal as well as other banks/gateways to report allÂ transactionsÂ above USD 500 to them long time back. Rather than following RBI&#8217;s norms, PayPal choose to set transaction limit of USD 500 for Indian users. This is a bit shocking as it was never asked to Indian usersÂ weatherÂ they mind sharing their transaction information with the RBI! Seems PayPal has &#8220;more&#8221; to hide from RBI than a businessman in India! ðŸ˜‰

**For point #2**, PayPal operates as payment gateway and not as a bank. This is why PayPal never gives any bank interest on money kept in PayPal account. This is again not acceptable to RBI. Ironically, issue of &#8220;interest&#8221; was never raised by PayPal users! And given a choice, I will personally let PayPal eat interest on my account balance rather than forcing me to withdraw money within 7 days!

**For point #3,** PayPal allows you to use PayPal balance to buy goods & services online directly which might be affecting India&#8217;s revenue from import/export.Â As an example, consider following common scenario:

  1. An Indian provides goods/services to a US client worth $100 andÂ receivesÂ payment of $100 (minus paypal fees)Â in PayPal account.
  2. After few days, above Indian provider spends $40 from PayPal balance to buy webhosting.
  3. Towards month end, same Indian provider withdraws amount of $60 (minus paypal fees) to Indian bank account.

In the above scenario &#8211; India as a county should do export worth of $100 and import worth of $60. But because users can pay via paypal balance, India will see only export of $40 (minus paypal fees).

While net effect remains the same (keep currencyÂ conversion charges aside), it will affect India&#8217;s turnover from import/export. This in turn might be affecting many things on which I cannot comment.

## Summary!

One thing is for sure, the way PayPal works has always been aÂ matter of debate. I always have a hard time explaining local banks/charted accounts/legal experts about how and why we use Paypal. But none of them are ever fullyÂ convinced. I guess in India, there are different norms for Payment gateways (like CCAvenue, EBS, etc) and Banks (like HDFC,Â ICICI, etc).

I already sent a few queries to my experts friends from various fields. I hope they will be able to give us more insight over time.Â I will keep this post updated. Being an Indian I am sure PayPal will figure it out how Indian system works soon and do necessary off-the-record &#8220;magic&#8221; to save its business in India! ðŸ˜‰
