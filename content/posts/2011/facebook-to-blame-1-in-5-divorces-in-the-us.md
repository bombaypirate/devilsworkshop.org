81% of the country’s top divorce attorneys say they have seen an increase in the number of cases for divorce. People who are more into social networking mainly Facebook tend to break up more.

Facebook is the unrivaled leader for online divorce evidence with 66% citing it as the primary source. I guess when people share more information about their personal lives and lead more people into it. Relationships do suffer.

We always should think before sharing, now. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Share you views about it with me here.
