This week was interesting for internet users in India. India’s telecom Minister came under immense criticism because he asked companies like Google and Facebook to remove and monitor content on social networks. This amounted to internet censorship and there was a lot of criticism against such ideas. Google+ circles also made into Gmail and Facebook has finally started rolling out Timelines on user profiles. Posts on these topics were the most popular. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
