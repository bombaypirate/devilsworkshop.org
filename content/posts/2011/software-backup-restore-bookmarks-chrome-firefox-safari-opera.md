Recently, I bought a new netbook and wanted my old Bookmarks transfered to my new netbook&#8217;s browsers. I generally use Google Chrome for normal browsing, Internet Explorer for Social Networking and Opera when something goes wrong with the other browsers.

So, here&#8217;s a free application which will help you backup all your bookmarks and then restore it to another computer&#8217;s browser easily with a click of a button.

**<a href="http://www.vag-lab.com/blog/bookmarks-backup/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vag-lab.com/blog/bookmarks-backup/', 'Backup Bookmarks']);" target="_blank">Backup Bookmarks</a>** is a free application which allows you to backup bookmarks from** Google Chrome**, **Internet Explorer**, **Apple Safari**, **Opera **and **Firefox**. Just download **Bookmarks_backup.zip** and extract it into a new folder. Now open the application inside the extracted folder and a new window will show up (*see screenshot*):

Now, You have to choose the Browsers from where you want to backup bookmarks and also select a folder to where the bookmark backup(s) will be saved for later use. Now click on theÂ **Backup **Button. You can also restore previous bookmarks by following the same steps under the **Restore Options** and click on **Restore **Button to restore the bookmarks.
