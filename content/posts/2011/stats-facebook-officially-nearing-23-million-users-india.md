Facebook is closing in on 23 Million users in India. Currently it is said, that India’s population is about 1.22 Billion. That means only 1.88% of Indians are on the internet.

It may seem less but these do not account for all the people who have fake locations included in their profiles. Even if we consider that, it is far behind <a href="http://fbknol.com/more-than-50-americans-are-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/more-than-50-americans-are-on-facebook/', 'USA which has half its population on Facebook']);" >USA which has half its population on Facebook</a>.

This proves that despite a lot of people knowing about Facebook in India, does not mean everyone has an account. This might be because of privacy issues or maybe people are still hooked on Orkut.

What do you think? Is Facebook growing as expected in India?  Do drop in your comments.
