Google had announced [two-step verification for some of its Google Apps accounts][1] back in September 2010. Now it is rolling out this extra security feature for all Gmail users. This is a good step as it means two sets of verification instead of just one which is the password.

The second verification step will be a code sent through a SMS on your phone. It is highly unlike for a hacker to be in possession of both your password and your phone, so this security measure will be almost foolproof.[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37613" title="Gmail_2-step" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/Gmail_2-step.png" alt="" width="500" height="271" />][2]

  * Once you sign-in to your Google Account, just look up <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount', 'Account settings page']);" >Account settings page</a>.
  * Here there is a new link to enable 2-Step verification (as seen in image above).
  * Here you will be prompted to enter your mobile phone number and a verification code sent. From then on you need to use your password and also the verification code.
  * A feature to remember your code for 30 days is also available.

## Why is 2-step verification better?

Most people will be happy with just a password as their security. But now a days it&#8217;s not just your email that is managed with a google account. We have photos, access to various apps and so many other important services with Google that having 2 step verification is a much desired feature.

What are your views on 2-step verification with Google? Will you opt for it, especially for accounts which are linked to Adsense? Do drop in your comments.
