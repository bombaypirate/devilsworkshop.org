Facebook just launched a new feature which is to show a preview of the link that we share in comments. It&#8217;s obviously a good feature but good for spammers as well. This &#8216;preview&#8217; of the page contains in a link shows a small randomly selected picture, which makes the comment as well as the link attractive so spammers can take advantage of it by using attractive pictures in a link so that more and more users will click it.

This &#8216;preview&#8217; of links is working on comments made on a profile, page or a group. All you need to do is type a link including the *http://* part and hit enter. It will automatically select a image from the shared link. Check out the screen shot below.

<img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-50886" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/preview-facebook.png" alt="preview facebook" width="411" height="200" />

You can see the additional information with the link like a pic, blog&#8217;s name and info. There&#8217;s also an option of &#8216;remove preview&#8217; as you can see above. Clicking on that link will remove the preview and only link will be shared like it used to be.
