Google has announced that it will start accepting applications for the **Summer of Code 2011** program.

  * Now in April, students have to register along with proposing a project for approval by a participating open source organization.
  * Once the proposal is accepted, students can write code all summer from April to September. Hence the name Summer of Code.

## Eligibility

  * The age limit for participants is 18 years old or over.
  * The students also need to be enrolled in a college program. If they are graduating in the summer they need to be enrolled in a college on 26th April 2011.
