The Social Network movie, that got 8 nominations for Oscars (<a href="http://fbknol.com/the-social-network-gets-8-nominations-at-oscars-2011/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/the-social-network-gets-8-nominations-at-oscars-2011/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>) is being released in India on 11 Feb again.

The film won several awards at the recently held Golden Globe Awards. Chances are it will win many awards at the upcoming 83rd Academy Awards on 27th February.
