This add-on is mainly used by most developers, as it allows making changes and seeing them on a live website.

At <a href="http://rtcamp.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com', 'rtCamp']);" >rtCamp</a>, many colleagues stick to Firefox even though I keep recommending Chrome. Their first argument seems to be Firefox has so many add-ons and [Firebug seems to be highly recommended][2].

Firebug Lite is available with Chrome. It is lightweight and has quite a few functionalities of Firebug add-on on Firefox.

## Firebug Lite Features

  * Firebug Lite can be activated for a particular domain. So every time you visit a particular domain with Chrome, Firebug Lite starts.
  * We can inspect and change HTML in real-time. A lot of the features are pretty similar to FirebugÂ  on Firefox.
  * The extension seems to be a lot faster and quicker with Chrome, especially if you are using <a href="http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite', 'Firebug Bookmarklet']);" >Firebug Bookmarklet</a>.
  * Unfortunately Firebug Lite does not support pages with frames and JavaScript debugger is also not available.

Even though I am not a web-designer and chances are I would only use Firebug Lite for some fun learning, I think having the power of Firebug on Chrome is another reason for me to stop using Firefox. ðŸ˜›

What do you think about it? Do drop in your comments.
