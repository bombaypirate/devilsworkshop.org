**Disney** has acquired the rights of  <a href="http://togetherville.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://togetherville.com/', 'Togetherville']);" >Togetherville</a>, which is Facebook for children under the age of 10. Wow, I never knew even kids love to socialize.

Here&#8217;s how Togetherville describes itself on its website,

> Today&#8217;s kids are growing up in a world that requires a whole new set of skills to become responsible **digital citizens**. In Togetherville, your kids learn much more than computer skills: they explore how to be creative, express themselves and learn in a fun, interactive and ad-free way. We help them use technology to connect with the important people in their lives &#8211; safely and responsibly.

I don&#8217;t know about this, will kids learn more computer by social networking ? What will happen to their kid minds ? There are log in types in Togetherville, if you are a parent you can enter the Facebook and if you are kid you will just enter the Togetherville. Facebook is used to validate the kid&#8217;s identity. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I just hope it is secure enough and no kid uses it to get into trouble. What are your views for it ? Share your thoughts with me here.
