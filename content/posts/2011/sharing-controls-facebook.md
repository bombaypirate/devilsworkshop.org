  1. This is a new button using which you can tag your friends with your status. It&#8217;s just like you used to check-in to places and tag your friends without using any @ before the name. The good thing about this feature is that you can also tag your friends while sharing a pic or video along with a status. Also it&#8217;s much easier to tag people this way.
  2. The second new feature is to add your location with your status just like twitter does. You can select a default location like my location is written on the right of that button i.e &#8220;New Delhi&#8221;. You can change it anytime by clicking that location button again.
  3. Same feature of sharing status or photo with some people from your friend list or hiding it with few people or even sharing it with everyone on Facebook. But it&#8217;s with a little change here, the only thing they added is a line which says: &#8220;Note: anyone tagged and their friends can also see this post.
  4. Now there&#8217;s a common button for sharing photos and videos. Just click on &#8220;Add photo&#8221; for that and it will allow you to browse and upload a video as well.
