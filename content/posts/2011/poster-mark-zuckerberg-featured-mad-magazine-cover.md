There are two things that takes a person to become part of American folklore in modern times. One would be to have hollywood find your life interesting enough to make a movie on it, and the other thing would be to get featured on Mad Magazine’s cover.

Zuckerberg is can now boast of both things. Social Network made his life story exciting and Mad magazine’s latest version is features him on its cover.
