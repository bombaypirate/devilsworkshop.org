Well before reading this tutorial further let me clear one thing that this post tells you how to **permanently delete your Facebook account**, you **can not get it back **once deleted. Please note that deleting account is totally different from deactivation an account.

In Facebook website, you don&#8217;t have any option of deleting the account directly. You can only deactivate it and use it again anytime you want to. To delete it permanently just follow the steps below:

1. Click the link below to go to the account deletion page. (Clicking on the link will not delete the account immediately).* *<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account', ' ']);" title="Delete facebook acount-Step 1"  target="_blank"><em> </em></a>

This will finally delete your Facebook account permanently. Your account will be temporarily deactivated for 14 days which is the last chance to recover your account. if you login to your account in this period of time your account will be back to normal again. After 14 days it will be deleted permanently with all of its details like friends, account information, pictures e.t.c.
