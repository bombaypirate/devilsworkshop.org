The puzzle like video game, which has wingless birds being used to destroy green coloured pigs has been a massive hit over the last year. The combination of humour, puzzles and simplicity has created one of the biggest gaming hits in the past couple of years.

It has been downloaded about 140 million times across platforms. It was initially released on Apple’s iOS platform. Now there are versions for Symbian, Android, Mac OS X, Windows and PlayStation.

With Chrome web store, users can play Angry Birds on a browser.

  * One of them is Chrome Bombs and other special features.
  * Also if using as Chrome web app, we can play the game on the browser even when the computer is offline. This could be very useful for frequent travellers who spend a lot of time killing time on trains and aeroplanes where you may not be able to access the internet.
