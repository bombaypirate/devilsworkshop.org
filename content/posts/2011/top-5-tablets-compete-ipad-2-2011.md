Why will it not? It has sold more iPads than all tablets every sold in just 2010. iPad has in a way opened up a niche market and made it mainstream. We saw some tablet computers over the last 5-6 years but none of them was a prime project for any one of them.

Dominating the market with so many positive reviews and no competition was easy for Apple’s iPad product. But, will this continue in 2011?

This year we have many companies which traditionally were into smartphones but are also jumping onto the tablet computers bandwagon.

Here is a list of 5 tablets that could likely dent iPad’s market dominance.

## #1. The BlackBerry Playbook

[<img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: right;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/blackberry_playbook_thumb.png" border="0" alt="blackberry_playbook" width="354" height="255" align="right" />][2]Research in Motion’s Blackberry smartphones did receive setbacks thanks to the popularity of iPhones. With the smart-phone market slipping away, RIM has re-branded Blackberry phone and also has the smaller sized tablet device called the **Playbook**. The Playbook is tapping into some discontent people might have over the size of an **iPad**.

The Playbook comes with a 1 GHz dual core processor. The RAM is 1 GB and it’s screen is only 7 inches. The plus point over iPad seems to be its acceptance of Flash. I think this tablet could be a hit with professionals as it has good compatibility with Blackberry phones. This is one of the few promising non-android tablets around.

## #2. Dell Inspiron Duo

[<img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: right;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/Dell_inspiron_duo_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Dell_inspiron_duo" width="354" height="176" align="right" />][3]The Dell Inspiron Duo is tapping the market which might be unsure of getting a tablet or a notebook. I am sure there are many people who are not sure about using only a touch device but might want a tablet device for reading or simply browsing. Dell Inspiron Duo does both. It is a regular laptop with hinges that allow it to become a tablet like touch device.

The Duo comes with 1.5 GHz dual core processor and with Windows 7 as a OS. The a big drawback compared to other tablets is that it has a screen that&#8217;s 10 inches wide. This makes it a bulky option especially if you are looking for a tablet device.

## #3. LG’s T-Mobile G-Slate

[<img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: right;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/T-Mobile_GSlate_LG_thumb.png" border="0" alt="T-Mobile_GSlate_LG" width="354" height="226" align="right" />][4]The T-Mobile G-Slate seems to be highly rated and might end up being one of the hottest selling tablets. It will have the Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) operating system. It also has a NVidia 2 Dual Core processor. The tablet using Android 3.0 will be quite watched closely by industry watches. This is because Android 3.0 is being developed only for tablet exclusively.

## #4. Notion Ink’s Adam Tablet

[<img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: right;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/adam_tablet_notion_ink_thumb.png" border="0" alt="adam_tablet_notion_ink" width="354" height="195" align="right" />][6]Notion Ink’s Adam Tablet seems to be a bit of an underdog but it is a company that is passionate from head to toe about tablet computers. The Adam tablet will have A-9 Dual processor along with support for USB 2.0 Ports. The bonus and interesting part seems to be it will be using Ubuntu and Andriod for its OS. The Notink Ink website also promises apps of the likes, that we have never seen.

## #5. Motorola Xoom

[<img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: right;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/03/Motorola_Xoom_tablet_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Motorola_Xoom_tablet" width="354" height="201" align="right" />][8]The Motorola Xoom tablet has recently been getting a lot of attention. Even Google seems to be excited about this tablet. The Tablet market is probably a roll of dice for Motorola which is not exactly setting the mobile market on fire. Xoom will have a large screen and 2 cameras. It will be designed on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb). It will come with 1 GHz dual core processor.

By no means we will only have 5 tablets being released over the next year. There may be many that might surprise us but these are the 5, that I think might dent iPad’s market. At the end of the day, it might just happen that iPad might be upstaged by an OS and not really a device. This will depend on the success or failure of Android 3.0. Whatever happens with Android 3.0 will be directly reflected on iPad sometime in the future.
