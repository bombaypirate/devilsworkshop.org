When Google introduced Google+, it insisted that you do so with a Google account (read your Gmail account). The idea was that your Gmail contacts would easily sit into Google+ Circles as most people use their email accounts to connect with friends, family and colleagues.

Google+ was not as well-integrated into Gmail possibly because of the backlash suffered from Google Buzz. But today Google has taken the plunge and has introduced Google+ Circles on the left hand column of your Gmail layout.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="Google+ Circles on Gmail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/Google_PLus_Gmail_thumb.png" alt="Google_PLus_Gmail" width="565" height="379" border="0" />][1]

Google+ Circles show up like your other labels. If you look up all your circles, you can see the mails from people within those Google+ Circles.

### Google+ Biggest Ace is Gmail

Google+ has over 40 million people signed up. But chances are that only a fraction of them are active on Google+. Google has packaged Google+ as a watering hole for all Google services and products. Gmail has a ready-made contact list for people to connect with each other. Google+ will leverage it and allow people to share on Google+ without actually visiting the social network.

If Google+ manages to get all those millions active, it will get some others like Facebook and Twitter a little nervous.

Do you like the idea of Google+ Circles&#8217; in your Gmail? Do drop in your comments.
