Do you see any update saying see this girl got expelled from school based on something she wrote as her status update ? Well, that is once again a scam.

Truth is nobody got expelled, nothing happened its just one more scam on Facebook these days. Have a look at the image below, you may recognize the image. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a href="http://fbknol.com/status-scam-girl-expelled-from-school-when-she-updated-her-status-on-facebook/girl-scam-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/status-scam-girl-expelled-from-school-when-she-updated-her-status-on-facebook/girl-scam-on-facebook/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-5295"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5295" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Girl-Scam-on-Facebook.png" alt="" width="465" height="147" /></a>

I clicked on that link, as promised it didn&#8217;t show anything similar to the status update. Instead it took me to another page where I was asked to fill some surveys. I didn&#8217;t click on any of them still it posted that message on my wall.

The number of scams are increasing every single day. The best solution is to never like or click on such messages and keep deleting useless applications from you application dashboard on Facebook.

Do share your views with me. What do you think? Any solution to such problems ?
