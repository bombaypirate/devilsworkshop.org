There was a time when people had different obsessions and disorders, but today people do face Facebook disorder. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There are millions of people who are online for full day, they cannot think of leaving Facebook. It&#8217;s almost like an addiction to drugs or cigarettes. Just as you cannot leave smoking in one day you cannot leave Facebook in a day. There are girls getting eating disorders due to Facebook.

I wonder what Mr Zuck would feel on this. He made 600 million people addicted to a drug called Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What do you think ? How addicted are you to Facebook ? Share your views with me.
