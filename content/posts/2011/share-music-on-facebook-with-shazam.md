Do you have a smart phone ? Do you like using <a href="http://www.shazam.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shazam.com/', 'Shazam']);" >Shazam</a> ? Well if answer to both of your questions is yes then you may find this interesting enough.

Now with the update available for Apple iOS today, users can tag music and immediately upload it on Facebook to share with their friends. These tagged and featured songs will be available for others also to see, if they too have the app activated and updated.

Alex Musil, Executive Vice President Product Marketing, at Shazam said,

> Over three million songs are Shazamed each day, and thousands of these are shared individually by people on Facebook every day. Shazam Friends now makes it effortless for you to see, preview, add to your tag list, and buy a track that your friends have discovered or listened to using Shazam.

It&#8217;s always nice to listen to your friend&#8217;s choice. If I am given a choice to listen to some random song, I will definitely ask for my friend&#8217;s choice.

**How to use Shazam ?**

  * Download the app on your mobile phone or iPod touch.
  * Hold the device up to a song that’s playing on the radio, in a coffee shop, in a store etc.
  * Hold it still for about a minute and the app will tell you the name of the song and the artist.
  * You then have the option to buy the song, share it on Twitter, Facebook, or email.

In Nokia phones you get a 30 day trial version, you can choose to buy also. what do you think ? Did you try this out ? Share your view with me.
