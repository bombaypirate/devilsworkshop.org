I found this image online posted on my friend&#8217;s Facebook profile. Have  a look at it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

It is an interesting conversation between Ron , Snape and Harry. With so many things coming on Facebook, it would be funny and interesting at the same time to imagine Harry Potter&#8217;s Facebook page.

If Harry Potter was on Facebook, I wonder how he would have made his profile page. Would it have been all colorful and magical ? My imagination is going to all places right now. Let me know what you think it would have looked like. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
