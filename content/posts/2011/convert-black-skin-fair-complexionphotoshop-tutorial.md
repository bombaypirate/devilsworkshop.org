In my previous Photoshop articles I made a tutorial on How to [Remove Certain Part][1] of an image and How to [Look Younger][2] using Soften Skin Effect, It was liked by many of our readers and through a feedback I was asked to create a tutorial on how to create a fair skin effect. Read the simple tutorial for fair skin effect in few easy steps.

Step : 3 –After you made a selection Go to **Image** menu > **Adjustment** > **Brightness/Contrast**.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0pt none;" title="brightness " src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/image_thumb3.png" border="0" alt="brightness " width="481" height="262" />][6]

Step : 4 – The following  pop up appears adjust brightness and contrast as per your requirement.
