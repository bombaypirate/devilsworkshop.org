The Yahoo Empire might have crashed or shrunk from [$100 Billion to $20 Billion][1]. Somewhere the board of directors for Yahoo, have woken up to this fact and decided to fire their CEO Carol Bartz.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Yahoo_for_sale" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/09/Yahoo_for_sale_thumb.png" alt="Yahoo_for_sale" width="300" height="300" align="right" border="0" />][2]

Carol Bartz confirmed being fired via a short message to all Yahoo employees.

> To all,
> 
> I am very sad to tell you that I’ve just been fired over the phone by Yahoo’s Chairman of the Board. It has been my pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you only the best going forward.
> 
> Carol

Now, according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/and-now-yahoo-has-put-itself-up-for-sale-2011-9" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/and-now-yahoo-has-put-itself-up-for-sale-2011-9', 'Business Insider']);" >Business Insider</a>, Yahoo has decided to take an even bigger radical step. The step involved putting Yahoo up for sale.

In other words, this is the end game for Yahoo and chances are we might see it being bought by some of the larger tech companies.

It also is a terrible time for Yahoo’s new CEO Tim Morse, as I am sure it would be difficult to get things done, knowing that the company is up for sale and seeing employees leave the company in large numbers.

What are your views on Yahoo being up for sale? Which company should bid for it? Do drop in your comments.
