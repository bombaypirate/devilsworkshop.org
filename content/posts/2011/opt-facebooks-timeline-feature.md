In mid-September, Facebook announced a radical change to its layout. The Timeline feature has made many Facebook users, register as developers. This is because of a [trick that allows developers to get Timeline feature on their Facebook profile][1]. So like millions of others, I ended up registering myself as a developer and activating Timeline on my profile. The profile looked a bit like the screenshot below. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

[Facebook has delayed rolling out Timeline][2] for all users possibly fearing a backlash.

In case you are feeling stuck on Timelines; you might want to delete the dummy app you created to simply revert back to the old layout or opt-out of Timeline.

### Opt-Out of Facebook Timeline

  * Firstly, this works for users who registered as a developer to get the new timeline feature. Visit the  developer page on Facebook (<a href="https://developers.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://developers.facebook.com', 'developers.facebook.com']);" >developers.facebook.com</a>).
  * Now look up the App settings which was created to register as a developer for getting Timeline on your profile.
  * At the App settings on the left hand corner you can see a link to delete the app (see image).

<div>

</div>

  * Now look up your profile on Facebook and you are back to the old layout. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<div>
  <strong>Note:</strong> This is meant to work only if you registered as a developer to get the Timeline features. Once the feature goes live for all users, as Facebook has promised, this method will not work.
</div>

### Why Facebook Timelines could never be released?

Taking a straw poll of my friends, I found that most people did not find Timeline adding in a big way to their Facebook usage. Some simply found the change of design too radical. Facebook in the past has simply not cared about feedback from users; but with Google+ around, they will be forced to not alienate their users to the extent they might move away from Facebook.

My intuition is that Facebook might release &#8216;timeline&#8217; with a layout which is a lot similar to the linear way people look at their profile or they might allow users to opt-in and opt-out for them to get used to the new profile layouts.
