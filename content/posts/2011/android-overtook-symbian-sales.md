Even if you think it doesn’t matter how far Android can go, ‘I will stick to Nokia’, then I must tell you that Android has now officially broken all records with higher sales figures than Symbian in the last quarter of 2010.  
<a rel="attachment wp-att-33129" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-13-must-have-android-apps-on-your-phone/android_logo/"><img class="size-full wp-image-33129 alignnone" title="Android_logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Android_logo.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

What’s more interesting is that while Android’s popularity has been ever on the rise, Nokia has adopted Symbian and have started to develop it in-house. Now we need to wait for the future which will tell us whether this was a bad business move by Nokia or not!

The sales were possibly fuelled by exciting handsets launched by Samsung, LG and HTC.

I am not predicting that Nokia’s strategy to become the leader in Mobile Technology is a failure, however Nokia must be very careful with its plans there are a lot of Nokia lovers out there specially in India.

Will Nokia manage to take Symbian to a new level ? Do drop in your comments.
