Facebook will soon be disabling the feature that makes phone number and personal address available for developers (<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/447" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/447', 'Source']);" >Source</a>). According to Facebook, they are disabling this feature as of now.

Facebook said,

> Over the weekend, we got some useful feedback that we could make people more clearly aware of when they are granting access to this data. We agree, and we are making changes to help ensure you only share this information when you intend to do so. Weâ€™ll be working to launch these updates as soon as possible, and will be temporarily disabling this feature until those changes are ready. We look forward to re-enabling this improved feature in the next few weeks.

They clearly mentioned that a user needs to see what they are allowing in an application. So as I said always look before you click allow (<a href="http://fbknol.com/privacy-threat-facebook-applications-access-home-address-phone-number/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/privacy-threat-facebook-applications-access-home-address-phone-number/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>), it seems that is the only good solution provided here. I wonder why not do something to increase the security.

They mentioned that we can manage what applications are using and choose to remove them from the application dashboard of our Facebook profiles. We can choose to share our address and phone numbers will home delivery shopping sites so that will be helpful. But that can be managed differently. What do you say?

We know what we have to click and what we don&#8217;t, but still we get Facebook scams. We know what we have to allow, still out address and phone numbers will go out. I just hope they work on it in a better way and make it effective.

Well, anyways they did listen to us and disabled the feature. Lets see whats in store for us now. Share your views with me.
