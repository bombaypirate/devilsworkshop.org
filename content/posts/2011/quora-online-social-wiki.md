<a rel="attachment wp-att-36829" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quora-online-social-wiki/quora_get_invites/"><img class="size-full wp-image-36829 alignright" title="quora_get_invites" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/quora_get_invites.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>One of the best ways to look up information online about anything is to look up a relatedÂ WikipediaÂ articles. In most cases the articles is updated and current along with being informative. For getting information which is more specific on various topics a useful method is to ask on forums or even on social networking websites.

<a href="http://quora.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://quora.com', 'Quora']);" >Quora</a> does something quite novel and that is it brings all these thingsÂ together.

The problem with getting on **Quora **is that it is quite exclusive. By exclusive, I mean it does not allow you to sign-up automatically but only if you have an invitation.

This is sometimes a problem as many of your friend might not automatically want to be on Quora &#8211; afterall it is not Facebook or Gmail. ðŸ˜›
