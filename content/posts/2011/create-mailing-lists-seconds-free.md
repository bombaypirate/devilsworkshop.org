Mailing lists are not as famous as they were before thanks to social networking websites. Earlier to have a to and fro conversation, it was useful to communicate through a mailing list. Mailing lists typically are often used now a days by people working on a project.

Google Groups and even Facebook Groups are now a days used to create mailing lists. I prefer Fiesta which is a nice service. I can create mailing list from my contacts and easily include and create mailing lists from them.

## Features of <a href="https://fiesta.cc/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://fiesta.cc/', 'Fiesta Mailing Lists']);" >Fiesta Mailing Lists</a>

  * It was easy to create the mailing list. I just had to include the email address I wanted in the list and add the ***list-name@fiesta.cc* **in the CC field. Here the List name is the name of the group.
  * A mailing list is created and everyone on it is notified. If you have created the list, reply to their confirmation mail and an account is created.
  * I use this to create a mailing list of all my email accounts I use. I mark some mail to all those accounts.

Once the email is sent and if your email address is entered in the mailing list, you can also block or unsubscribe to keep out the spammers. One can unsubscribe by also sending an email to *“list-name+unsubscribe@fiesta.cc**”** ***from your email address. This will remove your email address from the mail list.

To add more people to the list send email to the person you are adding and in CC field enter *“list-name+add@fiesta.cc” .*
