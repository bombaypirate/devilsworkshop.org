There’s a lot of buzz on HTML5 these days, especially because all the modern browsers and mobile devices support it, and you don’t need a plugin installed for it, unlike Flash.

SlideShare, world’s biggest platform to make, view and discover presentations goes HTML5, apart from presentations, it also supports PDFs, documents, videos and more, making it a perfect place for making and sharing presentations. This seems to be a right decision taken at the right time, as more and more apps are now adopting HTML5.

## So, how will HTML5 make SlideShare experience better?

  * SlideShare is now universal – Supports all devices including Apple ones.
  * Slides will be 30% faster!
  * A plugin free experience – To view slides all you need is a modern web browser.
  * Search Engines will be able to read the slides.

That said, slides embedded in blogs, webpages and old browsers like IE 6 (which majority of people use) will still run on Flash.
