Hindi will be launched with 4 new languages that are Filipino, Malay, Simplified and Traditional Chinese. After launching these new languages Twitter will support 17 different languages for more than 100 million users all around the world. Twitter made this official announcement on its <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2011/09/one-hundred-million-voices.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.twitter.com/2011/09/one-hundred-million-voices.html', 'blog']);" target="_blank">blog</a> after crossing 100 million users milestone.

Both Facebook and Twitter now have a large user database from India. We already have an option of choosing Hindi as our default language on Facebook. Some other Indian regional languages supported by Facebook are Bengali, Malayalam, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. Addition of this new language in Twitter will definitely increase its Indian user&#8217;s database but I&#8217;m sure that most of the Indians will continue to use it in English as it&#8217;s accepted worldwide.

Twitter is now 5 years old social networking and microblogging website but personally I still prefer Facebook when it comes to social networking due to its design and features. Twitter is good when you love to interact and stay connected with famous people, politicians, celebrities, blogs or even newspapers and magazines. Don&#8217;t forget to share your views about this new service launch on Twitter.
