With Facebook&#8217;s recently launched [smart and friends list feature][1], you can now categorize people in different ways depending upon how close are they. But with these two lists, Facebook also launched a new restricted list which is a good way to hide your updates from people you don&#8217;t know much or hiding from friends you met online.

You can easily add someone to restricted list but by default this list is empty. To access your &#8216;Restricted&#8217; list go to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/lists" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/lists', 'this page']);" target="_blank">this page</a> to see all of your lists and click &#8216;Restricted&#8217;. After that on the right sidebar you will see a space to enter your friends name whom you wish to add to this list. Select your friends from there. You can also click on &#8216;Manage List&#8217; on the top right side of page and click on Add/Remove people.

Once added in your Restricted list, your friend won&#8217;t be able to see updates from your profile unless and until that update is public. It&#8217;s a good way to keep few people away from your private content without unfriending or blocking them. Facebook is changing lot&#8217;s of things in it&#8217;s design and the good thing is that most of the changes are good and important. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
