<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/microsoft-security-essentials-its-free-but-will-it-be-useful/ms_security_essentials/" rel="attachment wp-att-15133"><img class="size-full wp-image-15133 alignright" title="MS Security Essentials" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/ms_security_essentials.JPG" alt="" width="198" height="179" /></a>I like using [Microsoft Security Essentials][1] &#8211; mainly because it is a good enough anti-virus and added incentive is that it is free.

Recently, Microsoft Security Essentials had started &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; identifying Google Chrome as &#8216;Malware&#8217;.

This meant some users with Microsoft Security Essentials, got a rude shock with their Chrome browser being removed.

### Did Microsoft Play Dirty with Chrome?

A short answer to this question is &#8216;No&#8217;. Apparently Chrome browser was tagged malware after an update from Microsoft Security Essentials. This might have happened because Chrome does download small updates automatically, which might have been picked up by the update as &#8216;Malware&#8217;.

To Microsoft&#8217;s credit, they did fix the issue and newer update of Security Essentials should fix the issue.

Unfortunately, people affected with this will have to uninstall and reinstall their Chrome browser.

### Microsoft&#8217;s second goof up of the year

Previously [Bing was accused of copying search results from Google][2]. This turned out to be true but not as dramatic as it was being made out to be by Google. The search results were picked up from third party add ons which tracked search usage and sent them back. It is something both Bing and Google do, but Bing ended up getting the bad publicity.

Similarly this time a goof up by Microsoft will surely start people suggesting that they did this on purpose to hit Chrome growth story which is coming pretty much at the cost of Internet Explorer.
