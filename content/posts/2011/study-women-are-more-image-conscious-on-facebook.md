Due to a recent study it has been shown that girls who are more image conscious put more photographs online on Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Hah ! I guess that is true.

In a recent post we told you how women upload <a href="http://fbknol.com/women-upload-200-photographs-than-men-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/women-upload-200-photographs-than-men-on-facebook/', '200% more photographs than men']);" >200% more photographs than men</a> on Facebook. Well, now it is almost proved that girls who upload more photographs on Facebook are image conscious. I agree to this, what about you? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

More comments, more likes are directly proportional to more popularity and success, in today&#8217;s social network world. Try talking to any teenage about it he will let you know more. ðŸ˜‰

The study, led by Michael Stefanone from the University of Buffalo, found that women who base their self-worth on their appearance take the help of social networking sites to feel good and gain attention.

They surveyed 311 volunteers and studied both how each participant used Facebook and what factors they base their self-esteem on. According to them women tend to use Facebook more for photographs.Â However, for people whose self-worth is defined by family life and behaving in a morally upstanding manner &#8220;spent less time online&#8221;.

I totally agree with this research. Let me know what do you think of it. Share your views with me here.
