Today when I logged into my Facebook profile, I was prompted whether I wish to change the language from English to Bengali.

Well, this is great. So many people use Facebook all with different languages so it is great when we can communicate with one another with their own language. I find this really good.

Have a look at the image below. Facebook is surely expanding and in a good way.

So, did any one try this out. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Do let me know what you think.
