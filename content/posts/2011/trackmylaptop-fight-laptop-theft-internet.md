If you have ever been a victim of Laptop theft, this is the right time you should inform your friends and relatives of this new initiative by Quick Heal Technologies, an anti-virus company headquartered in Pune (Maharashtra, India).

This initiative is aimed towards growing laptop thefts in India and the police unable to tackle the menace due to low technical know-how and inadequate tracking facilities.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="DW trackmylaptop1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/DW-trackmylaptop1_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW trackmylaptop1" width="644" height="242" />][1]

There are many software available which let people safeguard their laptop or netbook against theft by tracking the IP address of any new locations the machine is connected at, including the thief itself.

However this method proved a failure if the criminal does a physical format of the Hard drive before connecting it to the Internet. The software which resides in the Hard disk is no longer able to trace anything due its own existence in vain. Here ‘TrackmyLaptop’ initiative comes as a savior for both Quick Heal antivirus users and even for non-users.

## If you are a Quick Heal user

Your Laptop’s MAC ID is already stored in Quick Heal’s databases and even after your Hard disk is formatted and in case Quick Heal is re-installed, the installation will automatically send a report alongwith the new IP address and location of the computer.

## If you are not a Quick Heal user

You need to visit the website **TrackmyLaptop.net** after the theft and enter your Laptop’s MAC ID. You can enter upto 3 MAC IDs depending on your system’s network interfaces. Your entered MAC ID if found in the existing records should mean that either it was recovered by the Law enforcement agencies and the data was uploaded on the website OR Quick Heal was installed as an anti-virus post-theft which automatically updated the database.

Even if you are going to buy a second-hand laptop, it is recommended to use the website and check if the Laptop is not stolen. You can do this very easily by just entering the MAC ID of the Laptop you are going to buy. On methods on how to check the MAC ID of any machine, please <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-MAC-Address-of-Your-Computer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-MAC-Address-of-Your-Computer', 'click here']);" target="_blank">click here</a>.

Even though the initiative has come as a great boon to Laptop users, it needs to be promoted well to make it successful. I hope through this post, I will be able to share a word about the initiative with all of you. Kindly share this post with as much friends as possible and do let me know if you have any queries or suggestions.
