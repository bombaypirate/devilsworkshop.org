Last week we told you that how you can Backup or Export all your Facebook contacts with their E-Mail using a Yahoo! account. If you missed it you can read it <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/backupexport-facebook-contacts/" target="_blank">here</a>. Exporting contacts is a part of this tutorial so you have to read it before proceeding further. The good thing about this method is that we are not using any kind of 3rd party application and hence there will be no spam or scam.

**Requirements: **You need a Facebook account and a separate Yahoo account for this tutorial.

### Steps:

1. Follow the steps 1 to 4 of this tutorial: <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/backupexport-facebook-contacts/" target="_blank">How to Backup/Export your Facebook contacts.</a> After that all your Facebook contacts will also be there in your Yahoo! account with their E-Mails.

2. This will create a Backup of your friends till that day. Now if you feel that someone deleted you, you can check it out by opening the page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/find-friends" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/find-friends', 'https://www.facebook.com/find-friends']);" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/find-friends</a>.

3. On that page select Yahoo. Now enter your Yahoo E-Mail address that you used in Step 1 and click &#8216;Find Friends&#8217;. In this Step we are importing our contacts back to Facebook that we exported earlier.

4. Now a Pop-Up will appear asking your permission to start importing contacts on Facebook. Click agree to begin.

5. After that it will take you back to the &#8216;find-friend&#8217; window and will show you how many contacts are there who are on Facebook but not in your friend&#8217;s list. This is actually the list of the people who **unfriend you** (deleted you) from Facebook provided that there were no contacts in your Yahoo account before step 1. You can add them back by checking the box given with each profile else click &#8216;Skip&#8217;.

Check out the screenshot about, when I imported my Yahoo contacts it shows that I have 82 Yahoo! contacts on Facebook. That means a total of 82 people deleted me from their friend&#8217;s list from the day of my first Backup. Please make sure that you export your contacts time to time.
