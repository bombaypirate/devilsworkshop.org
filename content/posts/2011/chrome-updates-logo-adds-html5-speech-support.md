This browser version appears with a new shiny and two-dimensional logo ( see image below) for Chrome. It has also introduced support for speech recognition HTML5 feature.

## New Logo!

The new Chrome logo, seems to be flatter and two-dimensional compared to the earlier 3-dimensional logo. The new logo seems to resemble a fast spinning wheel. This possibly shows its obsession with speed. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Support for HTML5 Speech input API

Google has also updated support for HTML5 Speech input API. Website when using this feature allow people to speak into a microphone on your computer. This could be a way for promoting speech recognition or having spoken commands on websites. If that is the future of web then Chrome is certainly starting early.
