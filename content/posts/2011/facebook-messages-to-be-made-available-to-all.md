By now I guess everyone would be knowing about the new messages. The one that lets your email id be changed to abc@facebook.com ðŸ˜‰ Yeah and the same one which was about to be the Gmail killer.

Anyways, jokes apart Facebook has rolled out upgraded messages to many and has said ,

> We&#8217;ve begun expanding the rollout of Messages to everyone on Facebook. This will happen gradually over the next few weeks.

So, after a long wait finally this is happening. Finally we do have the Facebook messages. I really like it.

## Why should you have Facebook message ?

  * You can happily give your email id as abc@facebook.com.
  * You can just enter your Facebook id and get access to the Facebook profile. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> No need to write the full email id just enter the name and you get it!
  * Facebook messages are a better way to do the talking if the person is not online. The messages appear as chat.

So how many of you have the new Facebook messages ? Did you like using it ? Share your views with me.
