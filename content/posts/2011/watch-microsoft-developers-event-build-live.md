Windows 8’s release day is almost there! Today, Microsoft is going to start its developers event – <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.buildwindows.com/', 'BUILD']);" target="_blank">BUILD</a>.

## Watch the event Live!

The event will take place from Sept 13 to Sept 16 at California.The event shows the developers how they can use the potential of Windows 8 to build feature rich applications and more, thus many of the Windows 8 features will be leaked.
