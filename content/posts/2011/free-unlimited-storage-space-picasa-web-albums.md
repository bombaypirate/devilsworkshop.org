That might be the intention on Google’s part, but fact is Flickr is leagues ahead of Picasa. The first choice for people to share or store photos are on Facebook. Thanks to confusion on Facebook’s privacy settings, a lot of people end up saving or storing their photo albums on Flickr or Picasa.

Picasa web albums allowed free space upto 1 GB. 1 GB might be a lot when it comes to email or even documents but when it comes to photos that space can be filled up quite quickly.

## Unlimited storage space

One problem is that all the images you share on Google Buzz or even a blog on Blogger platform, the images are stored in Picasa Web Albums. This means that the images though small-sized can end up eating into your Picasa web space.

Google <a href="http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/2011/03/posted-by-matt-steiner-engineering-lead.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/2011/03/posted-by-matt-steiner-engineering-lead.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that from now on if the image is less than 800 pixels or if the video is less than 15 minutes long, those files will not count towards the 1GB limit.

So basically if you are uploading decent sized image files, you have unlimited storage capacity.

## Why offering unlimited storage space is important for Google?

Google might need to offer either more space or unlimited cloud storage space when it comes to photo albums. The reason for that is Chrome OS, which promises the dream of storing all things you need on the cloud. Without unlimited storage not many people would adopt using Google services. This is especially true when it comes to family photos and videos which is what end up being shared on Picasa web albums.

Flickr is a great product and surely far ahead of Picasa, but they have a familiar problem that is symptomatic of [Yahoo acquired companies][2]. The symptom of lack of innovation. In the past year or so, I have not seen anything radically innovative from Flickr and such complacency ends up giving competitors a free hand. In this case it just might be Picasa.

We will just have to wait and see, but in the meanwhile I am sure we all with enjoy the unlimited storage space from Picasa. Do drop in your comments.
