Facebook keeps changing things. Now it has changed the friend request&#8217;s side. Earlier it has changed the <a href="http://fbknol.com/games-notification-relocated-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/games-notification-relocated-on-facebook/', 'games notification']);" >games notification</a> and now friend requests.

When you see any request on the right hand side and click on it, that takes you to the left side of the profile page. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It still prompts you on the right hand side because firstly that was the original position of notification and requests, and secondly because generally people observe things in their right side first.

What do you think of the change? Share your views with me through comments below.
