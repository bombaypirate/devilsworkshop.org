Heard of earthquake hit Japan? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It&#8217;s a sad news. May everything settle and calm down soon.

On such natural calamities what do we do? We pray, we read news, we try  
our best to help people in problems. Well, Facebook has an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DisasterRelief?sk=info" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/DisasterRelief?sk=info', 'official global\ndisaster relief Page']);" >official global<br /> disaster relief Page</a>. No it wont lessen the trouble, it wont avoid the things or tell you in advance but it may help if you wish to learn about global disaster efforts across the world.

It&#8217;s like you can raise an awareness through it. By now every one of us know the power of Facebook and social media. So, involve yourself and get to know and do things.

What do you think? Did you click like on the page and at least prayed! It&#8217;s  
like showing your concern. Share your views with me on this.
