The phone itself is a great device but high expectations of people and rumors that Apple will launch iPhone 5 this year made it a little disappointing device when it actually came in front of us. Everyone&#8217;s saying that Apple isn&#8217;t going to continue its number one position in the smartphone market and iPhone 4S isn&#8217;t gonna be successful like iPhone 4 and 3GS. But when we actually studied the market what we found is that iPhone 4S is in great demand and even iPhone 4 wasn&#8217;t that popular. Here are few points that tells us why Apple iPhone 4S isn&#8217;t a disappointing device.

&nbsp;

### Disappointed by iPhone 4S; Really?

**Pre-Bookings:** Well I don&#8217;t know whether you are disappointed by its launch or not but more than a million people are happy with its launch. After the pre-booking got started, people ordered more than a million iPhone 4S in just 24 hours which is itself a record. Whereas this booking for iPhone 4 was 6,00,000 in a single day. This data clearly says how popular is the device.

**Google Search:** Ever tried searching iPhone 4S on Google? If yes then you must have noticed that the most searched terms about iPhone 4s is about its pre-order or the carriers with which it will be available. There&#8217;s nothing like a negative search in top searches about the device.

**iOS 5:** iPhone 4S comes up with most advanced Mobile Operating System till date. 4S will be pre-equipped with iOS 5 and there will be a free personal setup for iPhone 4S customers at the apple store. With iOS 5 you will get 200 new features. [Check out some major features of iOS ][1]<a title="10 new iOS 5 Features and Compatibility" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/10-ios-5-features-compatibility/" target="_blank">5 here</a>.

**Camera:** The new iPhone 4S is equipped with an 8 MP camera unlike iPhone 4 which is having only 5 MP. Also the aperture of the lens is more now plus the video is HD at 1080p.

**Processor:** iPhone 4s comes up with the iPad 2 processor that is A5 chip which is a dual core processor. That means it&#8217;s the fastest iPhone till date. Obviously you can&#8217;t get it in your iPhone 4 as it&#8217;s a hardware change.

**Siri:** &#8216;Siri&#8217; is the thing that makes iPhone 4S and 4 completely different. This is a voice based interface where you can give voice commands to your phone just like you talk to someone. Using Siri your iPhone automatically detects what you want and gives you a solution using 3G or Wi-Fi connection. You can even make calls, read messages, set reminders, check the weather or find something in maps using Siri. Again this is not an update for iPhone 4.

After these 6 solid points I think iPhone 4S is a powerful device and as always Apple didn&#8217;t disappoint us this time as well. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
