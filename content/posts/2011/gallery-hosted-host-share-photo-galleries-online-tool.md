title: Gallery Hosted – Host and share photo galleries with online tool
author: adityakane

excerpt: Most of us share photos on Flickr, Picassa or even on our Facebook profiles. This is usually done with friends and family. Sometimes I do not necessarily want my account URL for Flickr or Picassa with some people. This is where I liked the idea of Gallery Hosted. Gallery Hosted allowed me to upload a bunch of images and then share them online for others to look up.

## <a href="http://www.galleryhosted.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.galleryhosted.com', 'Gallery Hosted']);" >Gallery Hosted</a> Features

  * I did not have to sign-up to upload a few images online. Just visit the website and upload the images you want to share. The best part was I could upload images in bulk and did not have to do this one by one.
  * The best feature of **GalleryHosted** was that when I shared the URL of the gallery I uploaded, the visitor can look through thumbnails to navigate through the various images.
  * The good point about Gallery Hosted is that is allows unlimited hosting and its free.
  * To manage your galleries you will need to create and account.

I liked <a href="http://www.galleryhosted.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.galleryhosted.com', 'GalleryHosted']);" >GalleryHosted</a> for its speed. If you are looking to try out something different from Flickr, giving <a href="http://www.galleryhosted.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.galleryhosted.com', 'Gallery Hosted']);" >Gallery Hosted</a> a look won’t be a bad idea.

Do try it out and drop in your comments and views.
