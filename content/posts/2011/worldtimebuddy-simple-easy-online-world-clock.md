Do you have friends or colleagues you have to work with from around the world. If you do contact people from different countries, then I am quite sure you have some sort of world clock on your computer. This is crucial because, what might be a sunny afternoon for you, might be in the middle of the night for someone else. No use, calling someone in the middle of the night. Right? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I sometimes catch up with cousins from the US and Australia. Sometimes to schedule a meeting with all of them at the same time is quite difficult. The US is 9.30 hours behind Indian Standard Time and Sydney, Australia is a 5.30 hours ahead.

In this scenarios where you have to keep in mind, time zones of more than two countries **World Time Buddy** is a useful website.

This website makes it quite easy for setting and planning schedules, taking into account 3 or more different time zones.
