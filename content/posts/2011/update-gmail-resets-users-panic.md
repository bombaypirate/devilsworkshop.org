Yesterday morning though did not happen personally to me, heard a lot of noise in the Google gallery. News about Gmail accidentally deleting entire data of about 5,00,000 Gmail accounts started spreading like wildfire and hereâ€™s a sample.

## What did the Bug do?

An unknown bug cleaned up entire Gmail accounts of many users giving them a feel as if they have just opened a new account. Even the chat records vanished with 3 new emails welcoming the user to Gmail. ðŸ˜‰

## What now?

Google has already acknowledged the problem and has issued a statement that the engineers are working on the problem and accounts will be restored soon. There is another update which says only 0.08% of the accounts got effected by the bug (or 1,50,000 Gmail accounts) and not 5,00,000 accounts as believed earlier.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest</span>:** Recent updates claim that some of the accounts have already been restored and rest will be done as early as possible, but no specific timeframe provided.
