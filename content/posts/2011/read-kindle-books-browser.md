Cloud Reader is a new web app by Amazon with which you can read the Kindle books you bought. Amazon offers Kindle for PC which does the same thing, but a web app is always useful.

## Features of Cloud Reader

  * Read Kindle books online or even offline.
  * Has a really nice customizable interface, wish Google Reader has something like this.
  * Ability to bookmark pages while reading long ebooks.
  * Ebooks can be downloaded for offline reading. To download an Ebook, right-click on the Ebook cover and select *Download and Pin Book*. You can use downloaded Ebooks from the *Downloaded* section.
  * You can also sync the last page read with your Kindle (if you have one!), so you need to search for that page again.

  Amazon&#8217;s Kindle store does have many free Ebooks apart from paid ones, all you need is a Kindle account to get the Ebook.

Cloud Reader currently supports only Chrome and Safari. Do drop in your comments.
