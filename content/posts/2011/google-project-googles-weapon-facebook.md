Both are used extensively by people for discovering new content.

Search engines led the way for a long time, but lately people are getting their news, sharing photos and information on group events on Facebook. Facebook has forayed into search by tying up with Bing creating something called “[Social Search][2]”.

Google Plus, will be probably be the last time Google gets to challenge Facebook as a social network. If they get this wrong, we can safely assume Google just cannot crack the ‘social’ code.

## Is Google on the right track?

Google actually has all services that Facebook offers. We can share videos on YouTube, send email and chat via Gmail and save our photos on Picasa. So why is Facebook so popular? The reason is that Facebook allows users to do all the sharing in one single place and with one single contact or friend list.

Google Plus will be on the right track if it can manage to bring all these services together but at the same time be simple and easy enough to use.

The answer to the question if Google will crack the social code, only time will reveal. But at here is a video about circles which is a feature of Google Plus.



If you want a demo of visit their <a href="https://plus.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com', 'official site']);" >official site</a> and sign up to be invited. Google Plus will be rolled out gradually to all users.

Do you think Google Plus will be real competition to Facebook? Do drop in your comments.
