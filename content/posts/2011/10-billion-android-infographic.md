But Android is truly a very one of the most popular platform for mobile phones and tablets. It is open-sourced and many developers keep creating new apps for them.

Android has reached **10 Billion** downloads of their apps a few days ago. What is more amazing is that in March 2011 it that number was **3 billion** app downloads.
