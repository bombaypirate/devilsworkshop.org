Facebook first thought about sharing the user&#8217;s phone and address in January. Later it was <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-disables-personal-information-access-to-developers/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-disables-personal-information-access-to-developers/', 'cancelled']);" >cancelled</a>. Now, the news is that it is happening again.

Facebook goes on to give <a href="http://fbknol.com/privacy-threat-facebook-applications-access-home-address-phone-number/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/privacy-threat-facebook-applications-access-home-address-phone-number/', 'personal information']);" >personal information</a> about users such as home addresses and phone numbers to third-party developers and websites. Although the info is only intended to be shared with application developers, experts still fear it may be easier for scammers to take advantage of users who could give out their personal contact information after a few wrong clicks.

A spokesperson for the website said:

> You need to explicitly choose to share your data before any app or website can access it and no private information is shared without your permission.

Well, that&#8217;s true, easy to say and difficult to follow I guess. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What do you think about this ? Share your views with me here.
