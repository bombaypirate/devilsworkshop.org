It’s extremely useful for me, as I’m an download junkie and my downloads folder gets clogged up with files of different formats.

Certainly I don’t like to download all the software which are used to view the respective files.

With Free Opener, I don’t need to download any other extra software to open rare file formats. The software’s idea is very innovative and it just does what it promises! Let’s take a view at its features.

## Free Opener’s Features

  1. Supports 70+ different file formats including some rare formats like .vcf, .srt, .sql and more!
  2. Also opens Bit Torrent files (.torrent) and shows the files that can be downloaded through it.
  3. Free Opener can only open files, it cannot edit them*.
  4. You can print .pdf files and can also print preview them.

*It can extract compressed file formats like .rar, .zip, .7z etc

It does not support E-book formats like .epub which is disappointing. I’m sure that you cannot use this as a default file viewer but this software is a must have.

*Drop in your opinions after trying this tool!*
