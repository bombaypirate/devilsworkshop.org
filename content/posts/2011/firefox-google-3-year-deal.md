Some noted, that with Chrome around, Google might not want to make it easier for Firefox to raise money on a revenue sharing basis.

Google is the default search engine on Mozilla’s Firefox browser. This allowed Mozilla to earn revenues to continue funding the development of the Firefox browser.

Google and Mozilla have renewed this deal and as it is confidential. But it does mean Mozilla’s financial future seems more upbeat.

### Why Google Needs Firefox and Vice-Versa

  * Google’s Chrome browser has seen fantastic growth and [only recently it overtook Firefox][1]. But Google hardly makes money from Chrome. What happens is people using Chrome end up using Google search and that in turn makes Google money.
  * Not being the default search engine for Firefox would have meant conceding a significant number of users to Bing or another search engine.
  * Also with Microsoft’s history of being difficult to work with when it comes to browsers, Firefox would prefer a deal with Google and not Bing.

The result of this is that Mozilla and Google will work together for another 3 years and Google will continue to be default search engine on all Firefox browsers.
