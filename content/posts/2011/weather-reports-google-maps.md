I am sure when you visit a new city or a try to look for directions before visiting an unfamiliar place, you look up Google Maps. Now there is a new added layer on Google Maps which will allow people to see how the weather is in a particular place.

If you are looking at cities on a map, all you have to do is hover the mouse over to the top right hand corner of the map and we see a new ‘weather’ option added.

[<img class="wp-image-51300" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/08/Google_maps_weather_thumb.png" alt="Google_maps_weather" width="524" height="341" border="0" />][1]

Clicking on it adds a weather layer on the maps showing users the temperatures and weather conditions.

Another feature is if you zoom into a city, Google Maps also shows a 5 day weather forecast of that city on the left hand panel.

Here is a video that explains the workings of Google Maps Weather feature.

### How Google manages to show &#8216;weather&#8217; results?

Google is collaborating with <a href="http://weather.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weather.com', 'weather.com']);" >weather.com</a>, a website which shows weather forecasts. The new layer on Google Maps takes data from this website for its weather predictions.

I guess this new addition on Google Maps makes sense, considering so many people plan their trips with Google Maps. What are your views? Do drop in your comments.
