Facebook is leaving no stone unturned to make itself good and popular. Recently Facebook hired an ex Googler, named Amid Zoufonoun.

Amid Zoufonoun was in Google since 2003. Zoufonoun has led major acquisitions including On2, Grandcentral (Google Voice), Metaweb, Widevine, Feedburner, and Simplify Media, according to his <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/amin-zoufonoun/5/399/a6a" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkedin.com/pub/amin-zoufonoun/5/399/a6a', 'LinkedIn']);" >LinkedIn</a> profile.

He was director of corporate development in Google. Now he is leaving Google to come to Facebook. His will continue to be director of corporate development once he starts at Facebook next week. I wonder what package Facebook offered him to join their team. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Prior to moving to Google, Zoufonoun was the director of intellectual property and corporate counsel at ArrayComm LLC. He has a BS in electrical engineering from Santa Clara University and a JD from Santa Clara&#8217;s School of Law.

Well, jokes apart this is really good. Mark Zuckerberg just wants the best minds in the market to be with him.
