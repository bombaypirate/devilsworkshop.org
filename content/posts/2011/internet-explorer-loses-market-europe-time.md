Google Chrome in third place is gaining market share in Europe and has grown to 14.58% compared to 5.06% in December 2009.

This is the first time IE is loosing its number one position, the reason for loosing share is because Google Chrome is stealing IE share while Firefox is maintaining its existing position.

According to Aodhan Cullen, CEO, <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/press/firefox-overtakes-internet-explorer-in-europe-in-browser-wars" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/press/firefox-overtakes-internet-explorer-in-europe-in-browser-wars', 'StatCounter']);" >StatCounter</a> &#8220;We are probably seeing the impact of the agreement between European Commission competition authorities and Microsoft, to offer Europe users a choice and menu of browsers&#8221;.

In North America and world-wide IE remains at first position with a clear lead in browser market with 48.92% followed by Firefox (26.7%), Chrome (12.82%) and Safari (10.16%).
