In 2009, 88 countries participated and the CN Tower switched off its lights. Last year, 128 countries signed up. This year Angie Bird, 26, Toronto resident set up <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shut-Down-Fbook-4-Earth-Hour/147197015337844" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shut-Down-Fbook-4-Earth-Hour/147197015337844', 'a Facebook page']);" target="_blank">a Facebook page</a> to ask Mark Zuckerberg to shut down Facebook for an hour.

We all know how much carbon is emitted from data transfer through internet. She has targeted Facebook because it has the greatest number of users.

She has also posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvRYxixyXio" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvRYxixyXio', 'a YouTube video']);" target="_blank">a YouTube video</a> on her page:

> Imagine you just changed your Facebook status to ‘Mark Zuckerberg just saved the world, LOL!’ ”
