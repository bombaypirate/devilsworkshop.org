Whenever a new version of Windows is shipped out, the IE browser’s version also gets an upgrade.

Windows XP came with IE6, Windows Vista had IE7 and Windows 7 had IE8 pre-installed. The reception to the browser versions also reflected how the OS was received. Just like people are not ready to upgrade from XP to Vista, IE6 users seemed to not bother upgrading to IE7 or even IE8.

## Microsoft’s message with IE 10

With IE 9 being released, many felt it was [the last chance for Microsoft to save IE browser][2]. With the release being only a month ago, the preview build of IE 10 was a surprise. IE 9 was expected to be shipped as default with the next version (Windows 8?) of Windows.

With IE 10 Microsoft is telling the internet community that they will probably upgrade browser versions without waiting for newer OS to be introduced.

## IE 10 Features

  * It is really good at making most use of screen space like IE 9 does.
  * The graphics support along with CSS rendering is pretty good, as shown by a tests like <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishBowl/Default.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishBowl/Default.html', 'Fish bowl']);" target="_blank">Fish bowl</a> and <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/Paintball/Default.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/Paintball/Default.html', 'Paint Ball']);" target="_blank">Paint Ball</a>.
  * IE 9 has a good record when it comes to handling power efficiency. For Laptop users like me, that is a good incentive. I found IE 10 preview not being as light-weight but that might change when IE 10 goes into Beta from Preview version.

### What Microsoft needs to do to give IE 10 a boost?

Firstly, IE 10 preview only works with Windows 7. I am not sure if that will happen with IE 10 browser going ahead but if it does, then it would be disappointing. Internet Explorer needs to offer support to Mac OS and Linux-based OS.

This will truly separate IE from Windows as a product and maybe then we might see IE browser building its own independent identity as a browser which does not only revolve around Windows.

I doubt that all this will happen considering how IE finds itself shooting in the foot, what are your view? Do drop in your comments.
