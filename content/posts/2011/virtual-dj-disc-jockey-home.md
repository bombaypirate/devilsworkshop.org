Ever wondered how these famous DJ’s play their music just using a Computer? Well it&#8217;s not beyond your reach anymore as I would like you all to see an interesting software “Virtual DJ” which lets you play all your music in a DJ fashion and that’s not the end, the Home version lets you add upto 99 decks at a time and what’s interesting here is that its FREE! It is available both for PC and MAC.

The interface may seem a bit confusing initially, but later Virtual DJ would make you comfortable mixing music. The software even boasts of mixing videos in the latest version and even records the music you create in WAV format. It runs in full screen view and let you put various effects, add new tracks, change the pitch and shift balance between music. There are a lot of skins available on the website for you to choose.
