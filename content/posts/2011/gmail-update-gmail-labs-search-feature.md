In a recent update, Google has added a Search feature for its Labs section at Google Mail. Till now, users had to either scroll through the Labs page in the Gmail settings or look for  a Lab through Google search but this also is now made easy by adding a small search box at the top of the Gmail Labs page. The search is absolutely real-time and infact there is no “Search” button alongwith the Search text box.

This feature has been added owing to the growing number of Labs on Gmail and making it more difficult for users to scroll through the entire list. Another great feature from the house of Google!

Do leave your comments on what all Labs you use and what you love about them! Waiting for some nice comments!
