One complaint I often hear from them is about how there is very little information about cities they are visiting.

Information like travel routes, some basic interesting places in the city they are touring will actually help people explore more.

I found **<a href="http://www.mustseeindia.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mustseeindia.com/', 'Must See India']);" >Must See India</a>** quite informative and it seemed to have all the information you would need while travelling in India.

  * One thing that stands out with the website is that it has more options than one can handle.
  * I could search for the best bus, plane or train travel details from one place to another.
  * It also has comprehensive information on almost all places of interest in India.
  * The portal is split in three parts Search, Explore and Book. I found the Search part quite novel is tours arranged in different themes like hill stations, beaches or historical places.
