Later in the night yesterday some people saw weird updates on the Facebook&#8217;s CEO profile. Well, TechCrunch reported about it followed with other blogs and many comments.

As you can see in the image above there were almost 1800+ comments and likes. People just jumped into comments and there was nothing that could stop them! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If the news is to be believed then it has been hacked. I wonder if Facebook security cannot afford to save their maker&#8217;s profile then what is the use ?Will it ever be able to save any other person&#8217;s profile?

On the other hand side, the original profile of Mark Zuckerberg is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/zuck" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/zuck', 'facebook.com/Zuck']);" >facebook.com/Zuck</a> and this appears to be <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MarkZuckerberg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/MarkZuckerberg', 'facebook.com/MarkZuckerberg']);" >facebook.com/MarkZuckerberg</a> which is  no longer available. (I tried to have a look at it) There can be many reasons, may be somebody just created a fake account and did all this just to create news or make it hype.

We don&#8217;t know the truth yet, but this surely has made news and many people will be afraid to have a Facebook profile now. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What do you think?
