As 2010 ended two people were in the news a lot. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange', 'Jullian Assange']);" ><strong>Jullian Assange</strong></a> because he runs **Wikileaks **which is publishing information and embarrassing a few corporations and governments.

The other person in the news is **Mark Zuckerberg **who runs **Facebook **which through 2010 was accused of leaking our personal information for targeted advertisements.

Recently I came across this poster on <a href="http://polizeros.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://polizeros.com/', 'polizeros']);" >polizeros</a>.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="assange_zuckerberg" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/assange_zuckerberg_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="assange_zuckerberg" width="426" height="724" />][1]

The poster makes it quite clear that people and their privacy is a distant second to the privacy of corporations and governments. Whether right or wrong is a different argument, but it seems that for some time Zuckerberg will travel the world over picking up awards and <a href="http://fbknol.com/mark-zuckerburg-shows-funny-side-snl/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/mark-zuckerburg-shows-funny-side-snl/', 'appearing on TV shows']);" >appearing on TV shows</a>, while Assange will travel all over appearing in different courts.

What are your views on privacy, Facebook and Wikileaks? Do drop in your comments.
