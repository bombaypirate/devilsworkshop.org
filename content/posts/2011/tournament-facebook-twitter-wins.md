No matter if you have some decent clothes to wear or not, being a Facebook and Twitter member is compulsory! Facebook has taken over almost every other social networking website in terms of popularity and now giving competition to the big daddy, Google! However with Facebook and Twitter reigning the Internet generation, there are often comparisons made between the two. I would like to highlight a few.

## Facebook is Personal

If you just look at Facebook and then Twitter, obviously you would like to browse more on Facebook as it is not just text, but a lot of images, videos, apps and much more. While on the other hand, Twitter just comes with 140 characters of plain Text!

## Spam is easy @ Twitter

Whatever you do at Twitter does attract spammers to your account and they start following you. As following is easy unless you specifically block people, Twitter just stays as a platform for “marketing-without-limits” which not everyone on the Web is looking for.

## Facebook is Quick and easy

We cannot hide the reality that Facebook is much more easy for a novice to understand and build his network quickly. On the other hand, Twitter takes more time in comparison to understand and get some fruits.

## Facebook is He-man!

That’s a humorous title though it is true that Facebook has much more powerful servers than Twitter which keeps Facebook Live all time, while Twitter gets overloaded very often.

## Facebook is Future!

There are many predictions that Twitter may not have a very sound future as compared to Facebook. There are several reasons for that, the major one being that Facebook has maintained a balance between personal and business aspects, while on the other hand Twitter is increasingly being used just for marketing and has lost the personal touch!
