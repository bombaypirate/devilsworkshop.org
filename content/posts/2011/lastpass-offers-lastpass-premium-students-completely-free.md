LastPass, the ultimate cloud based password manager is giving away premium accounts to students for six months. If you’re a student, having a .edu email address, you can take advantage of this offer.

[<img class="wp-image-50705" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;padding-top: 0px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/Lastpass-student-promo_thumb.png" alt="Lastpass-student-promo" width="776" height="221" border="0" />][1]

Many of the universities these days have a .edu domain (although, Indian universities rarely have that domain), *stanford.edu* for example. So, if your university has a .edu domain, they will certainly provide you a email address too, and that’s the proof that you’re a student.

To get LastPass Premium for free, head on to their <a href="https://lastpass.com/edupromo.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://lastpass.com/edupromo.php', 'offer page']);" target="_blank">offer page</a>, fill your .edu Email address, verify it and you’re done! Sadly, I don’t have a .edu email address, so I didn’t give it a try.

If you’re curious to know what all extra features you get by using LastPass Premium, here’s the list.

  * Download LastPass for all platforms – iOS, Blackberry, Android, Windows Phone, WebOS, Symbian and even Dolphin browser.
  * Ad-free LastPass experience.
  * Use LastPass without installing any plugin
  * Add an extra layer of security to your LastPass vault using LastPass Sesame for USB thumb drive.
  * Use Yubikey for multi factor authentication to secure your LastPass vault.
