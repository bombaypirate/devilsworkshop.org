There are 30 million Facebook users in UK, and the total population of UK is around 60 million. Nice, I must say!

Joanna Shields, vice president of sales and business development at Facebook, made the announcement this morning at a media conference in London. She said,

> We can announced to day that we have reached 30 million in the UK, which we are really excited about.
