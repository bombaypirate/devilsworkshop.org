Until about a year ago when you thought of the words &#8220;Tablet Computer&#8221; we immediately thought of obscure tablet models from HP. Today when someone talks about a tablet device, we think only about [Apple&#8217;s iPad][1]. Such is the power of Apple as a brand. It usually has complete domination over their niche.

The tablet seems to have the goods and as you can see in the video below, it will have two cameras which will record in 3-D format.

## iPad killer or a just another tablet?

The big question will be how will it compare with Apple&#8217;s iPad. I think it will all depend on the goodies that iPad 2 will have. LG&#8217;s G-Slate could be a real threat to other tablet computers out there. I guess RIM better pull up it socks.

Here is a video about LG G-Slate on YouTube.  


What do you think about LG&#8217;s G-Slate? Will it be compete or will it be brushed aside by iPad? Do drop in your comments.
