Unlike Google+,Â  Faceboook don&#8217;t allow it&#8217;s users to post animation on their profile or anywhere else on their website. But we know that impossible is nothing in this world. Let&#8217;s see how we can post an animated status on Facebook. ðŸ˜‰

I just found a profile posting .gif animations with it&#8217;s status updates. These animations are not full images rather these are just some smileys but animated ones. I tried contacting the profile owner but he simply refused to tell how he&#8217;s doing that. So unfortunately we can only share these statuses without any editing.

### How to share animated statuses?

Check out this profile&#8217;s wall

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002629497712&sk=wall" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002629497712&sk=wall', 'https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002629497712&sk=wall']);" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002629497712&sk=wall</a>

Click on the profile above and check out cool animated status updates shared by him. Click on the share button with every status he shares and post it on your profile as a status. These statuses are not customizable but are really good and you can share it without any editing as he&#8217;s not using any particular name with those statuses.

**Alternate way**:

If you can&#8217;t see the share button with a status click on the time when the status was posted like &#8220;*39 minutes ago&#8221; *posted below the status. Click on that link and then share it with your friends just like you share a normal post or link on Facebook.
