With celebrations across the world, Wikipedia finally turns 10 today and is set to mark another beginning of free information sharing with full rights to people what they write and see. This model once believed to be a failure has changed the way people share information across the globe today. It&#8217;s no other than Jimmy Wales and his founding team who has set apart a name for Wikipedia through its free and flexible model.

It would not be hypothetical to say  &#8211; “**The new definition for Information hosting on the Web is just a word, its none other than Wikipedia**”.
