Social networks are far too many to many in number and often we are a little confused on where should you update a particular status. Does it go on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Foursquare and there is even the option of being prudent by not posting at all. ðŸ˜‰

Here is a nice flowchart by <a href="http://www.breakingcopy.com/social-media-flowchart-status" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.breakingcopy.com/social-media-flowchart-status', 'Breaking Copy']);" >Breaking Copy</a>, which is amusing but is quite relevant when it comes to deciding which social network you should post your status on.
