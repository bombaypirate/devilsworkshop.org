We are often addicted to certain sites. For me I guess it is Facebook and YouTube. I have links to them on my bookmark and sometimes end up on those websites far more than I should be. ðŸ˜›

If you are someone like me, who works on the internet and will have access to all sites which might be considered slightly unproductive, you should look up <a href="http://keepmeout.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keepmeout.com/', 'KeepMeOut']);" >KeepMeOut</a>.

## <a href="http://keepmeout.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keepmeout.com/', 'KeepMeOut']);" >KeepMeOut</a> Features

  * Just visit the website, type in the URL of the website you want to avoid visiting.
  * The default time it blocks a website is 60 minutes but I could customize to less or more.
  * After this, we get a URL. Just drag and drop it to your bookmarks. Best to rename it to the name of the website.
  * Now once you click on the bookmark, it will not allow you to visit that website for the time you have set for yourself.

I found this quite useful toÂ bring about some self-discipline in my surfing habits. We can still visit the website we want from a different browser or even typing in the URL in the address bar. It is not really a blocking tool but more like a self-help tool.
