Facebook upgraded its Privacy policy, recently.

They have come across 3 principles,

  1. First, it should be easy to understand, even when the concepts are complicated, or it is of no use to anyone.
  2. Second, it should be visual and interactive, because that&#8217;s the way people use the web today.
  3. And third, it should focus on the questions people who use Facebook are most likely to ask, because that makes it relevant.

They have decided these based on the feedback received by people. This is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150434660350301&id=69178204322" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150434660350301&id=69178204322', 'just the draft']);" >just the draft</a> of what it&#8217;s about to come in some days. You can comment on it and ask for changes also.

Facebook developers said,

> There is still a lot of work to do, and we want your feedback to tell us if we’re on the right track and how we might make it even better.  Please leave your questions and suggestions in the comments field below.

Somewhere they also mentioned,

> Our own privacy policy has been criticized as being &#8220;5830 words of legalese&#8221; and &#8220;longer than the US constitution – without the amendments.

Ha ha ! Off course, it is criticized zillions of times. Well, lets see if something improves now. Share your views with me here.
