[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-18357" title="Wikipedia" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/Wikipedia.png" alt="" width="250" height="120" />][1]Wikipedia is one of the most widely known and successful open-sourced projects. Hundreds of millions of people use Wikipedia as a source of information. Old styled encyclopedia books are now truly on their way to become rare collectors items.

Wikipedia is maintained and managed by many committed users who read, proof-read and create content. All this is done free and voluntarily.

To enable appreciation and simplify the process, Wikipedia has <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/06/24/wikilove-an-experiment-in-appreciation/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/06/24/wikilove-an-experiment-in-appreciation/', 'announced']);" >announced</a> a “Love Button”. The new button, will be visible in the talk button once you login to your account (see image). This currently is available only with a <a href="http://prototype.wikimedia.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://prototype.wikimedia.org', 'prototype website']);" >prototype website</a> for Wikipedia. This will go live on the 29th of June 2011.

It was quite amusing to use as I could send a virtual “Barnstar” to other users.

## Wikipedia’s move to increase contributors

This is a move to directly encourage people who actually take part in contributing content to Wikipedia. Editing and adding content is tedious and it is dominated by a strong but committed group of people.

This group needs to become bigger and a good way would be to start appreciation by peers.
