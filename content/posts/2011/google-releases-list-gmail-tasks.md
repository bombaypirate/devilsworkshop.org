Google has conducted a survey for Gmail users. The survey was about one of the most underrated features of Gmail which is “Tasks”. **Tasks **was highlighted in the latest [Gmail layout upgrade][1]. Now Google has revealed a list of the features they will add to Gmail Tasks.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Gmail_logo_updates" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Gmail_logo_updates_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Gmail_logo_updates" width="244" height="244" />][2]

Google has <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/top-tasks-for-google-tasks.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/top-tasks-for-google-tasks.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a> this list, which has the top five features requested with Gmail Tasks.

  * Create repeating tasks.
  * Reminders and notifications.
  * Sharable task lists.
  * Tasks API and synchronization.
  * Visual distinction for overdue tasks.

Personally I am quite happy about visual distinction for overdue task being worked on by Gmail. This is critical as looking overdue task on Gmail is not very helpful, as in they are not highlighted well.

These features should be a part of Gmail Tasks soon, you can expect them over the year, and you can [keep reading DW][3] to stay up to date with these and other new updates.

What are you views? Do you use Gmail Task or any other service for being productivity? Do drop in your comments.
