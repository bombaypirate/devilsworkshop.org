Back in 2007, I was a big fan of Yahoo Messenger, especially because I didn’t have a Facebook account, not even a Google Account, to chat with anyone. Things have changed, like many (not everyone) I don’t use messengers on my Windows.

Along with Yahoo Messenger, AIM was also very popular for instant message. Today both these services are losing out big time. In order to make a comeback, AOL announced that AIM is no more orthodox, and released its new IM client, the AIM Preview.

## Features of AIM Preview

  * Chat with your Gtalk, Facebook and AIM buddies all at one place.
  * Group chat with your friends, share photos and videos, along with one-to-one video chat.
  * Get Facebook, Gmail, Instagram and Twitter notifications right inside AIM, instantly.
  * If you’re using AIM for iPhone, then it syncs the message history with the desktop version.

I have a bad experience with Facebook Chat and if you have similar issues then AIM is your best bet. It’s <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/5-great-messengers-for-windows/" target="_blank">not the only IM client</a>, as you have great alternatives like Digsby, Pidgin and all, but it’s hard to disagree that AIM has improved.

It&#8217;s available for Windows, Mac, iPhone and Android. Try it out and tell us how you like it.
