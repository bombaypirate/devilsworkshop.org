Did you notice today, that you can ask a question to many people on Facebook. Facebook relaunched it&#8217;s much-loved feature, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/questions/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/questions/', 'Facebook Questions']);" >Facebook Questions</a>.

According to this feature, you can ask a certain question to many Facebookers. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We had this feature earlier also but with a difference.

All questions are still public, and answers by all users to the same question are listed on the same page. The difference is that each user gets a personalized view of the responses, ranked by what their friends voted on. Think of each answer as an anonymous poll where your friends’ answers are emphasized.

The questions are in a personalized way. Earlier it was for market research. Users can either add their own response, or just check a box to agree with answers already given by others. Specific places or products can be quickly included by linking to the appropriate Facebook page.

What do you think ? Share your view with me here. Do you like the return of Facebook Questions ? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
