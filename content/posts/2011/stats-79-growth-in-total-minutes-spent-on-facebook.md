Comparing the last year&#8217;s stat with 2009 we found out that there is a 79% change when it comes to total number of minutes spend on Facebook. Wow, that is a good number of change. Have a look at the image below.

Facebook statistics are growing every day. When we compare it on yearly basis we find out a big % change in all most everything. Total unique visitors are increased, average daily visitors are also increased. Well, more and more people are joining Facebook and being social.

With the <a href="http://fbknol.com/face-of-egypts-protests-ghonim-says-thank-you-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/face-of-egypts-protests-ghonim-says-thank-you-facebook/', 'recent incident']);" >recent incident</a> of Egypt getting free from Mubarak, I guess more people want to get into Facebook era and share their likes . I am sure when next year we will compare the stats, Facebook will still be growing and happy!

This comparison was made by comScore. According to them Facebook visitors in the 35-54 years old age group actually dropped by 3.6 percentage points in 2010, but Facebook saw gains in the percentage of visits from the under-18 crowd and those 55 and older.Â What could be the reason ?
