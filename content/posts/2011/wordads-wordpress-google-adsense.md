Thousands of blogs make money online thanks to those text-based advertisements, that show up above the post.

Google Adsense is still the king of online advertising for bloggers. This might change soon if WordPress has its way. WordPress has <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/wordads/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/wordads/', 'announced']);" title="WordPress Blog">announced</a> WordAds, an advertising program that will show Ads on WordPress powered blogs. This is being done with a tie-up with Federated Media.

### How does this help WordPress.com?

<div>
  WordPress.com users usually stick to the free service even if it has decent traffic. Most bloggers are not professional bloggers. WordAds might serve as a carrot for many bloggers to upgrade their accounts to custom domains and get WordAds.

<div>
  WordPress.com has been growing a lot lately, with over 50,000 WordPress powered blogs everyday. This means there is a huge opportunity for WordAds to succeed with small publishers who might not find Google Adsense relevant or even might not qualify for Adsense.
