In recent times there has been a lot of buzz online about a Anti-Piracy Bill in the United States. Many internet companies like Mozilla, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and more have stated their opposition to SOPA.

An <a href="http://americancensorship.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://americancensorship.org/', 'organization']);" >organization</a> backed by Mozilla, Creative Commons and Wikimedia has created this infographic below that shows the effect the bill could have on internet companies.

Considering a majority of the internet companies are in the US; this could have a global impact. Somewhere down the line, it seems legislation has to catch up with technology as older rules on copyright and publishing cannot be applied on internet communities where a lot of the content is user-generated.

Do drop in your views.
