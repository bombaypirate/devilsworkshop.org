The main problem with privacy seems to be the ever-changing Facebook privacy policy.

Default options have been adjusted over time and some old problems like photos being visible to people you did not share the image with explicitly have made people distrust Facebook when it comes to privacy.

Facebook has been investigated for how it manages privacy of their users. <a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150378701937131" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150378701937131', 'Mark Zuckerberg in a post']);" title="Mark Zuckerberg on Privacy">Mark Zuckerberg in a post</a> has now admitted they made mistakes when it came to managing privacy of users.

> Overall, I think we have a good history of providing transparency and control over who can see your information.

> That said,** I&#8217;m the first to admit that we&#8217;ve made a bunch of mistakes**.

Facebook has a different tone now compared to 18 months ago, when Facebook changed default privacy settings for users which left many angry and disenchanted with Facebook. It seemed that Facebook would get away with anything they do because people do not have any real alternatives.

Competition always makes companies more humble and Google+ might just have improved Facebook on finally accepting that they are not all that popular when it comes to privacy.

These charges were that Facebook deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.
