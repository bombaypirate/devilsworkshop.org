  I play â€˜Counter Strikeâ€™ often though I need to keep the installer on my machine as I donâ€™t like to keep the game installed all time, due to less available space on my hard drive. However when I saw Gaikai, I could see a future where people will be able to play major games online without any need to install and run them.

## What is Gaikai?

It is a cloud technology which let users play HD and major PC/Console games directly within their browser. No need to install or download anything.

&nbsp;

## No need for a powerful computer

Gaikai is all about running major games on its powerful servers located in the US/Europe to give you a great experience on your normal PC/console. What all you need is to have the latest version of Flash/Java installed. It will work alright even if you have a 4-5 Mbps connection.

## Level of HD support

Ofcourse HD is supported, thatâ€™s how Gaikai is different. 480p and 720p resolutions are supported by most connections though 1080p may need higher bandwidth at your end.

&nbsp;

## Which games are supported?

&nbsp;

  * Mass Effect 2
  * Dead Space 2
  * The Sims 3
  * Second Life

I believe nothing more for nowâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰

## Whatâ€™s the bottleneck, huh?

Ofcourse Gaikai is not running a charity. The games you can play now on itâ€™s beta website are not full versions instead they are time-bound or demos. The games made available to you are just to try and experience a game beforehand making any decision to buy them. Still not satisfied, read the <a href="http://www.gaikai.com/faq#general" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gaikai.com/faq#general', 'FAQ']);" target="_blank">FAQ</a> and watch the video to see Mass Effect 2 in action.

Folks, folks, folks, I know the first word is going to be is it available in my country, my place? The answer is: Gaikai is heavily investing on new servers in the US, Europe and Asia now. So letâ€™s wait and hope to play online soon. Share your words with me!
