Many years ago my primary email address was from Hotmail. Then I got an invited to use Gmail by a friend. From then on I pretty much stopped using my Hotmail account. The great plus point with Gmail was that it hardly had no spam. My Hotmail account was increasingly spammed and frankly I never really cared much after Gmail what Hotmail really had to offer.

Now Hotmail users will be allowed to create up to 3 disposable or temporary accounts. This is a great move as often we have a dummy email account or look up various services like [10 Minute Mail][2] and [Guerrilla Mail][3] to makes sure our regular email accounts are not spammed.

So if you have Hotmail, you can simply do this while you are logged into you email account.

## How to create alias email ids on Hotmail!

  * Just log into your Hotmail account and visit the Options. Under Options look up **Managing your account **heading.
  * Here click on **Account details (password, aliases, time zone).** Here you should be able to access creating a alias account.
  * Another short cut would be to just click <a href="http://mail.live.com/?rru=createalias" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mail.live.com/?rru=createalias', 'on this link']);" >on this link</a> while you are signed into your Hotmail account and it takes your directly the page where you get to create an alias.

This is a nice innovation by Hotmail when it comes to managing email. I do not think I am going to move to away from Gmail anytime soon but it is good to see some innovation from Hotmail. What are your views? Do drop in your comments.
