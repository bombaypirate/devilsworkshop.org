Unlike Facebook pages, you have an option of sharing a number of pictures (more than one) in a Facebook Group. And that too simultaneously with a single click, you don&#8217;t have to select pics one by one. Let&#8217;s see how you can do it in any Facebook Group.

To do it, open aÂ  Facebook Group. Please note that this feature is available with recently updated groups only, it&#8217;s not available for groups with old &#8216;Facebook page&#8217; like appearance. After opening a group click on photos. After that select &#8220;Create an Album&#8221; from the three options.

Now select some pics that you want to share with that group. All the pics that you have selected will be uploaded simultaneously just like you upload an album on your Facebook profile. This is a much convenient and faster way of sharing pics. Thanks to the new design of Facebook groups. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
