Sometimes we upload our photos on Facebook using our mobile in the album &#8216;Mobile Uploads&#8217; but later we feels that the pic should be there in another album. The easy but inefficient way to move a pic from one album to another is to download and upload the image again in a new album. But this is not a good idea to do so as you will lose all the comments and likes to that photo and it will be uploaded as a completely new pic.

Here&#8217;s a method how you can move your Facebook photos from one album to another without losing your comments and likes. Suppose we want to move a picture from album A to B. Then open album A and click &#8216;Edit Album&#8217; as shown below.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48478" title="moving pic-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/moving-pic-1.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="358" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now select &#8216;Edit Photos&#8217; which will open all the photos present in that album.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48480" title="moving pic-2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/moving-pic-2.jpg" alt="" width="439" height="244" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After that select the pic you want to move from this album to another. Below that pic there will be a drop down list having name of all the albums in your Facebook account. Select the new Album&#8217;s name (Album B) from the drop down list.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-48482" title="moving pic-3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/moving-pic-3-600x380.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="380" />

&nbsp;

Finally click save changes. This will move that pic to a new album. This will also show the moved pic on your profile as an update and in the news feed of your friends. Feel free to ask any doubt. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
