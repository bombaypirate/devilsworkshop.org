I often watch movies on my computer. It runs on Windows 7 and my favourite movie player is VLC player (Video Lan). One very useful reason to do so, is the feature of downloading subtitles from the internet and synchronizing them with the movie I am watching.

I came across a nice Add-on for VLC Player, which allows the user to download subtitles of a movie while watching the film.

## Using Subtitle Finder

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VLC_Subtitles_Finder" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/09/VLC_Subtitles_Finder_thumb.png" alt="VLC_Subtitles_Finder" width="550" height="314" border="0" />][1]

  * First make sure your VLC player is updated. The latest version can be found from <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.
  * Now visit ***<a href="http://addons.videolan.org/content/show.php/Subtitles+finder+1.04?content=141787" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://addons.videolan.org/content/show.php/Subtitles+finder+1.04?content=141787', 'Subtitles Finder']);" >Subtitles Finder</a>***, and download the (*subtitles-mod.lua*) file on your computer.
  * If only code is shown, copy-paste it into a notepad and save the file as **subtitles-mod.lua. **Make sure File Type is selected as ‘All Files’, otherwise the file might end up being saved as a** .txt** file.
  * This file has to be added into VLC Folder in Program Files on your computer. Below is the exact path where the file has to be added.

> **Windows (all users):** %ProgramFiles%\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\extensions\
> 
> **Windows (current user):** %APPDATA%\VLC\lua\extensions\

  * Now while you are watching a movie on DVD and do not find subtitles in English or any particular language then you can simply click on ***View >> Subtitles >> Download***.
  * We have the option of searching but most times the subtitles are found without any trouble. Click on “**Load Selected Subtitle**” as you can see in the image above.
  * For older version of VLC player, you might have to look up the Subtitle Finder by clicking on ***View >> Extensions >> Subtitles***.

Next time I am watching a movie, especially in a foreign language, this VLC extension will surely be most useful.

Do drop in your comments.
