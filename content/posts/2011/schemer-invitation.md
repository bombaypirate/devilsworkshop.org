The service is still invite only and not yet open for everyone. If you want to get on it, you might want to sign-up on their website and wait for an invitation.

But people who are already on Scheme, can fast-track that waiting period by inviting others.

We at Devils&#8217; Workshop have a few invites to share with you.

### About Schemer

Schemer is like a social network for sharing activities and things you are planning to do. For example, you can share your plans on reading a particular series of books or learn to play the guitar. These activities can be shared with your friends and also publicly if you wish. Read more about Schemer [here][2].

See you soon on Schemer. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
