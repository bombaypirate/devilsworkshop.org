You might be a fan of Steve Jobs or not, but one thing was certain that he lived a very interesting life. The man founded Apple, was made to leave his own company, returned to Apple as CEO decade later. He not only changed Apple’s fortunes but he also changed the way we listen to music, use smart-phones and breathed life into the tablet computer niche.

I came across this <a href="http://infographicworld.com/the-life-and-times-of-steve-jobs/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://infographicworld.com/the-life-and-times-of-steve-jobs/', 'infographic about Steve Jobs']);" >infographic about Steve Jobs</a>, which tries to capture the essence of his life.
