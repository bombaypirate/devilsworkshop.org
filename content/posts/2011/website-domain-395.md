However before you get the fruit, you must remember few things:

  1. The promotion is just for domain registrations for the 1st year only and for a new domain.
  2. Registration of only one domain per Yahoo account is allowed.
  3. This offer expires on 31st December 2011.

Bored of reading those Terms above? Now I have something interesting to tell you folks.

  1. I have even done a domain renewal using the same promotion, so even you can try doing so. If you already have a domain (not on Yahoo) and looking to renew it for just $3.99, start with the link given below and enter your domain name. It will ask you if you wish to transfer the domain, as it already exists. Carry on with the process and you will get yourself another year just for the pity price.
  2. Yahoo says only one domain is allowed per account, so while you register any domain just make sure you sign up for a new Yahoo account as well.
  3. Payment methods are only PayPal or Credit card. I would recommend using PayPal as this can keep your Credit card a private affair. Don’t worry it’s alright to use the same PayPal account everytime even for different Yahoo accounts.
  4. After your registration is successful, make sure you remove the Yahoo subscription from your PayPal account as otherwise your domain shall be renewed automatically the next year.
  5. The last expiry date I had seen for the same promotion was 31st December, 2010 and now we can see it extended. Probably Yahoo would not even mind extending the promotion further.
