Apple released the iPhone 4 more than a year ago 7th June 2010. Since the past six months there has been a lot of speculation about when the iPhone 5 will be released. Generally, it was thought that the new iPhone will be unveiled in October as the September event was usually reserved for iPod releases.

According to <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/12/apple-may-unveil-iphone-5-on-september-7th/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/12/apple-may-unveil-iphone-5-on-september-7th/', 'BGR']);" >BGR</a>, Apple will show off iPhone 5 on the 7th September event.

This might be mainly because iPods are probably not as highly anticipated as much a new iPhone or iPad releases would be. With the new iPad rumoured for a November or early 2012 launch it might suit Apple to release iPhone 5 a little early.
