The rumors that your Phone contacts are visible to everyone on Facebook are not true, claimed Facebook on Thrusday (August 11th 2011). According to these rumors all the Facebook friend&#8217;s contact numbers in contact list of your phone was set visible to everyone on Facebook by Facebook officials but Facebook denied it.

The actual thing is that these numbers are not visible to everyone or even your frineds on Facebook. These numbers are only visible to you and are used for ease of access so that you can directly call a facebook friend from your phone just by clicking it. To enhance this thing Facebook also launched a new feature i.e &#8220;Request your Friend&#8217;s phone number&#8221; which&#8217;s available on platform&#8217;s like Facebook for BlackBerry and iPhone.

Since from the beginning, Facebook is very much concerned about it&#8217;s user privacy and they have a good privacy policy. They can&#8217;t even think of making all the contacts visible to everyone on Facebook so just Chill and enjoy Facebooking! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
