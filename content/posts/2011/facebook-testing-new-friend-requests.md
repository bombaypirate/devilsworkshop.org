Sending friend requests and making friends is one of the most loved features of Facebook. Facebook is testing a new way to do so.

Now the friend request shows you how many friends that person has, number of photos wall post ,etc. Well, this is a nice way to give you some insight about the other person.

This is only available for people who are using Facebook&#8217;s new messages. The image you are seeing above is taken from a Facebook user&#8217;s messages. Previously,Â these messages only contained a link to confirm the friendship and telling how many mutual friends you have.

How many of you experienced this new friend requests ? Share your view with me.
