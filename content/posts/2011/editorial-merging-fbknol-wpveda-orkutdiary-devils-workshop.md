Devils Workshop, as some of you may be aware is more than 5-year-old blog. Over the time, we forked out 3 new blogs &#8211; OrkutDiary, FbKnol and WpVeda out of this Workshop.

The goal behind creating those topic-specificÂ blogs was to provideÂ comprehensiveÂ information source to readers following some of hottest topics out there.Â Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t meet our goal. In fact, with so many blogs in our network, we ended up spending more time inÂ managingÂ them leaving us less time for writing. So after more than a monthsÂ brainstorming we decided to *&#8220;undo&#8221;* our mistake.

Today we have merged 3 blogs in our network, that are OrkutDiary, FbKnol, WpVeda back into our top blog Devils Workshop.

### Why we decided to merge them&#8230;.

**OrkutDiary** was merged few days back for obvious reason &#8211; we ourselves stopped using Orkut since long so it wasn&#8217;t updated for quite some time. Writing about stuff we don&#8217;t use personally was never our style! ðŸ˜‰

**FbKnol** was merged as personal interest started to drop in it. Though FbKnol statsÂ wereÂ quite impressive, its future didn&#8217;t look promising enough to invest more into it. *(off-topic: personalÂ interestÂ is shifting to Google+)*

**WpVeda**&#8216;s merger is hard to justify. We have no plan to quit WordPress platform for blogging *(and business also)*. WpVeda was just turning out to be a misfit in our overallÂ strategicÂ plans.

As you can see for each of above blog we had a reason to merge it back into Devils Workshop.Â After this merger, rtBlogs network now has one dedicated blog for all technologyÂ relatedÂ stuff i.e. Devils Workshop.

### What does this mean for Subscribers?

If you have subscribed to any of above blog via email newsletter, RSS feed, twitter and/or Facebook fan-page; you willÂ continueÂ to get updates without Â anyÂ interruption.

If you are already a subscriber at Devils Workshop, then you can unsubscribe from old blog(s) as content related to them will be served on DevilsÂ WorkshopÂ again.

### What does this mean for Contributors?

If you love writing about Facebook, WordPress or even Orkut, you now have a much bigger and better platform to write. Yup, you can now post all technical stuff on Devils Workshop without bothering about niche!

I hope this will make some of our contributors happy who were not comfortable posting on small topic-specific blogs.

### Summary&#8230;

Going by records, efforts we put into creating 3 blogs, their logos, themes, branding, etc are all go in vain now. But I have a gut feeling that this will prove a right decision going ahead.

For rtCamp, rtBlogs was never a prime source of revenue.Â So, we never bothered about this decision&#8217;s impact on search-engine rankings, traffic, revenue and other factors across rtBlogs Network.

FollowingÂ line can sum up this event in better way&#8230;

> *I may be walking slowly but I never walk backwards&#8230; whenever I walk backwards itâ€™s for a long jump!*

Let us know how do you feel about this merger! Your comments, feedback, suggestion, criticism &#8211; all are welcome!
