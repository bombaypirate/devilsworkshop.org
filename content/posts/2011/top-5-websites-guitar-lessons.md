  A good tutor is essential if you want to master the art of playing the guitar. Although guitar tutors take a lot of money and dont really teach at the speed at which a person wants to learn.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Best thing to do is learning on our own using the biggest tool at our disposal &#8211; The Internet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you are a beginner and want to learn, you should buy a cheap yet a good quality guitar. Go into a local shop that sells all kinds of Indian instruments. It would not cost more than Rs. 2,000 to get a basic non-branded acoustic guitar (Try bargaining).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Brands such as <strong>Grason</strong>, <strong>Givson,</strong> <strong>Hobmer</strong>, <strong>Java</strong> are all Indian made brands, which are cheap and perfect for beginners. While selecting a guitar, check the neck of the guitar. The neck should be perfectly straight, without any curvature.
