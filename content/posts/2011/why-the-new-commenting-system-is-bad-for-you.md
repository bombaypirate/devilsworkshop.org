Recently I told you that Facebook <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-removes-it-comment-button/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-removes-it-comment-button/', 'removed the comment button']);" >removed the comment button</a>. Well, that was kind of surprising. I am still wondering why did Facebook take this step.Â Anyways I have noticed a few drawbacks if you use the new commenting system.

First of all, there is nothing like write a comment look at it confirm and press &#8216;Comment&#8217;. It&#8217;s like when you had that button a sense of security was there. When you are sure what you have written you pressed comment. Now you just need to press &#8216;Enter&#8217;.

If you think you have written something out of rage and you just wish to remove it, well in that case you just have a few moments. The &#8216;X&#8217; sign that used to remove the comment earlier, now is used for editing. When you wish to edit a certain something, click on &#8216;X&#8217;, you are given an option to edit it. But remember this is only for a few seconds or till nobody else has replied below your comment.:(

This is weird, you cannot edit the comment once written, you cannot remove it accordingly. Oh my God that is like really dangerous. So now always think before writing, no matter how angry or happy you are! I have got myself into trouble so many times but always had an option to remove my words, now it&#8217;s not like that.

Did Facebook developers want people to fight on comments or just scared of commenting? I am busy wondering the reason behind it. What about you ? Share your view with me.
