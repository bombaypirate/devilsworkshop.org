Wow, did you notice that now you can tag people while writing comments ? I just saw this today while commenting on rtCamp&#8217;s anniversary celebration pics. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

You just need to add &#8216;**@**&#8216; sign before a name. Just as in the image I tagged @rtCamp, it gave me a number of options to choose from. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> When you type the symbol &#8216;@&#8217; before any letter, a drop down list appears to let you tag people.

This is fun! It wasn&#8217;t there earlier. It&#8217;s kind of new. Did you try this out ? Share your views with me after trying this yourself. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
