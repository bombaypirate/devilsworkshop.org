The only thing that makes BlackBerry devices popular and important is BlackBerry Services like E-Mails and BlackBerry Messenger (BBM). But unfortunately these services are down since last three days due to a &#8216;Core Switch Failure&#8217;.

According to an official information by Research In Motion (RIM):

> The messaging delays were caused by a core switch failure within RIMâ€™s infrastructure. Although the system is designed to failover to a back-up switch, the failover did not function as previously tested. As a result, a large backlog of messaging data was generated. We continue to work toward restoring normal service as quickly as possible.

Now it&#8217;s been three days and the problem is still there. Also the problem doesn&#8217;t seems to be for few of us but many BlackBerry users from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, India, Brazil, Chile and Argentina are facing the same issue of BBM and E-Mail. Due to this problem the BBM stopped working completely and there&#8217;s a major delay in E-Mails as well. Even I am receiving E-Mails in bulk after a gap of 5-6 hours. BlackBerry officials are working on this problem and the services will be back soon but there&#8217;s no deadline for that.

Please **NOTE **that there&#8217;s no official broadcast message asking users to send it to all their contacts to get BBM services back. It&#8217;s just a randomly circulated message and you don&#8217;t need to re-broadcast it.
