I get asked questions in emails by colleagues and guest authors. Most emails can be replied to immediately but sometimes you need to check on a few things and plan out your replies. I usually mark such emails unread and get back to dealing with them later.

When I am checking my email from a different computer or a mobile phone, then I wish I could make an important email get sent to me again after 24 hours to remind me of its importance.

<a href="http://hitmelater.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hitmelater.com', 'Hitmelater']);" >Hitmelater</a> allows forwarding emails to it and specifying a certain time when the mail should be sent back to you.

This can act like a reminder to get back to the email after 24 hours. [<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="hitmelater_resheculde_email" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/05/hitmelater_resheculde_email_thumb.png" border="0" alt="hitmelater_resheculde_email" width="570" height="414" />][1]

I could send the email to come back to me as a forward after 24 hours. As you can see in the image above, just take the message you want to reminded about later and forward it to ***24h@hitmelater*** or ***10minutes@hitmelater.com***. This is like a snooze button for your email.

Here are some email options that will be useful up to 24 hours.

  * Sending email by hours â€“ ***24h@hitmelater.com*** or ***10 h@hitmelater. ***Here the number indicates hours that need to go before you are sent the email back as reminder.
  * Similarly, to delay email by minutes, use*** 10minutes@hitmelater.com*** or ***10m@hitmelater.com.***

This service will be very useful for people who are on vacation or on a day off, and check their email on their phone. This way they could make sure they give priority to an email after 24 hours and it does not get buried under newer emails.

Best part is it does not even require registration unless you are looking to create a premium account. Do drop in your comments.
