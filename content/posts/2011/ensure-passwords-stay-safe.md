excerpt: When I first started using Online Banking, I was not really sure about what all kind of Viruses and Malware can affect my privacy. However as soon as I came to know about Malwares which can even steal what you type using your keyboard (called Key Loggers), I started looking for an Anti-virus which can protect me even against this kind of threat. This was when I found out that Anti-virus software are unable to scan for more than 20-30% of the malwares. My search ended at a small tool “Key Scrambler” which I found to be promising.

When I first started using Online Banking, I was not really sure about what all kind of Viruses and Malware can affect my privacy. However as soon as I came to know about Malwares which can even steal what you type using your keyboard (called **Key Loggers**), I started looking for an Anti-virus which can protect me even against this kind of threat. This was when I found out that Anti-virus software are unable to scan for more than 20-30% of the malwares. My search ended at a small tool “Key Scrambler” which I found to be promising.

Key Scrambler works by encrypting the key strokes at the Kernel and decrypting them back at Application level. This gives no place for the Key Loggers to trace the original keys you pressed. The Free version of this tool let you protect your passwords and important data from Key Loggers but only for Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Flock. The Pro and the Professional version let you protect a host of applications on your PC.

  * Size is small when compared to Anti-virus or anti-malware tools
  * Supports a wide range of applications including Windows User Logon
