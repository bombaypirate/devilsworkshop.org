I am often asked if it would be better for me to send them a PDF file of the article. Trouble is most automated tools do not simplify the design when converting from HTML to PDF.

With JoliPrint, which is a free online tool, I could create PDF file of content on any webpage within seconds.

  * Just enter the URL of the web article you want to convert into a PDF file.
  * Users get a link to download the PDF file. A quick option is there to share this link on Facebook and Twitter or even email.
  * What I liked is how it converts the article into easy to read format. Below is an image that compares the two. The one on the right is the PDF format.

It also has a WordPress plugin along with a Blogger Gadget for webmasters to use this feature as a part of their blogs and websites.
