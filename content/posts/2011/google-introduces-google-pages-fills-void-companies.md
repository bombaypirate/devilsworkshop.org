I pointed out in the post I wrote a few days back, <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/showdown-google-facebook/" target="_blank">Google+ lacks interaction between companies and customers</a>.

Google has announced Google+ pages which seems to fill this void, before its release people used to make separate Google+ accounts for their businesses which Google used to banned, because people need to use their real name in Google+.

## How to create a Google+ Page?

  * First and foremost, make sure Google+ pages is activated for your account, by <a href="https://plus.google.com/pages/create" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/pages/create', 'heading on to this link']);" target="_blank">heading on to this link</a>.

  * As you see in the above screenshot, you just have to select the category in which your page falls into, enter the name and other credentials.
  * Then your page will be created and you then need to upload a profile picture and enter a tagline.
  * You can then share your page publicly or just share with your friends, and that’s it!

Here’s something important, now as you’re an admin of a page, you can interact with people as a page or as a individual, you can switch from the drop down menu near your profile picture. In the same drop down menu, click on **Manage your pages**, to delete the pages you&#8217;ve created.

Pages appear on search too, just enter the keyword, say Techcrunch and you get the Techcrunch page in the results, under the **People and Pages** menu.

[<img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/11/Image-025_thumb.png" alt="Image 025" width="470" height="309" border="0" />][4]

What’s more cool is that, people can hangout even with page admins.

It will be interesting to see if Google+ can attract businesses, and if this can increase user interaction. Tell us what you think about Google+ Pages.
