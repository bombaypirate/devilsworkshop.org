Most of the time people ask questions about Facebook messages like how to delete a particular message from a conversation or what happens when we delete a particular message from that conversation, will it be deleted from the receiver&#8217;s inbox as well? This post will give answers to all your queries.

### 1. What&#8217;s the difference between new Facebook chat and Facebook messages?

In a recent change in Facebook&#8217;s chat and it&#8217;s previously launched &#8216;Facebook mails&#8217;, Facebook integrated both Chat and inbox messages. With this new integration, all your messages can be seen on chat as well or you can chat in your inbox. While the &#8216;Facebook Chat&#8217; is online way of interacting with your friends, &#8216;Facebook Messages&#8217; is the offline one. Now you can type a message in the chat window of an offline friend and send it to his/her inbox directly.

### 2. How to delete a particular message from the Facebook inbox?

With the new inbox, you have an option of deleting a particular or few messages from the whole conversation. To do so, open any Facebook conversation in your inbox and click &#8220;Actions&#8221; on the top of that page. From the drop down list select &#8220;Delete Messages&#8221; and check the box given with every message you&#8217;ve sent or received. After that, click &#8216;delete selected&#8217; as shown below.

### 3. What happens when I delete a message from my inbox? Will it be deleted from reciever&#8217;s inbox as well?

Well no, whenever you delete a message from your inbox after sending it, it won&#8217;t be deleted from the receiver&#8217;s inbox. Just consider it like Outbox of your cell phone&#8217;s SMS. After sending a SMS you can delete a message from your outbox but not from others inbox.

### 4. How to delete a Facebook message from friend&#8217;s (receiver) inbox?

Clearly it&#8217;s not possible to delete a message from receiver&#8217;s inbox once it&#8217;s sent. You can delete that message only if you know the password of his/her account. ðŸ˜‰
