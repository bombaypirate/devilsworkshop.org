I admit to being a die-hard Chrome fan. I like Firefox a lot of how customizable it is. Chrome’s minimalist layout, simple sync options along with Apps and extensions makes it my browser of choice. I guess a lot of people think like me and are adopting Chrome. Latest reports by <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201111-201111-bar" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201111-201111-bar', 'StatCounter']);" >StatCounter</a> suggest that Chrome has a market share of **25.69%** while Firefox has slumped to 3rd place with **25.23%**.

Internet Explorer is still at top with **40.63%** but over two years ago it was almost near the 60% mark.

So let us see the growth of Chrome over the last two years. It had about 4.44% of the market share in November 2009 and has grown to get over 25% in only 2 years.

[<img class="wp-image-50600" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/Chrome_2ndspot_graph_thumb.png" alt="Chrome_2ndspot_graph" width="570" height="328" border="0" />][1]

If you see the graph above, Chrome’s rise seems to be consistently on an upward trend. There do not seem to be big spikes at all. This means they are growing consistently and continuously.

Firefox has fallen off somewhat over the last year and that is not surprising. As Chrome churned out extensions and Chrome apps. It even [introduced Chromebooks][2] where the Chrome becomes the OS.

Comparatively Firefox has lost its way. A good indicator was how it launched Firefox 4.0 earlier this year after almost 1 year of anticipation. Firefox gets updated more often than ever all of a sudden and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://devilsworkshop.org/firefox-updates-80-brings-integrated-twitter-search-addons-security/&sa=U&ei=JwjZTv3HC8rqmAX55ICQBA&ved=0CAQQFjAA&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNHj8-8S8oygwjq5lFZ23oV5wc2yrw" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/url?q=http://devilsworkshop.org/firefox-updates-80-brings-integrated-twitter-search-addons-security/&sa=U&ei=JwjZTv3HC8rqmAX55ICQBA&ved=0CAQQFjAA&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNHj8-8S8oygwjq5lFZ23oV5wc2yrw', 'Firefox 8 is already available']);" title="Download Firefox 8">Firefox 8 is already available</a>.

Internet Explorer has not managed to hold on to their users and is consistently losing out. The success of Windows 7 has not exactly spilled on to Internet Explorer.
