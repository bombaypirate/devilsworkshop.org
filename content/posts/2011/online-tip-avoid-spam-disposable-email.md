    Couple of days ago, Ankit Das reviewed a SEO tool called Traffic Travis. The software could be downloaded but to test it, I needed to register with an email address. I usually get sceptical of such sites that ask for email, because this is how your inbox can end up being spammed.

Couple of days ago, [Ankit Das][1] reviewed a [SEO tool called Traffic Travis][2]. The software could be downloaded but to test it, I needed to register with an email address. I usually get sceptical of such sites that ask for email, because this is how your inbox can end up being spammed.

<a href="http://10minutemail.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://10minutemail.com/', '10 Minute Mail']);" >10 Minute Mail</a> is a nice online service which creates disposable E-mail address for us to register and work. As the name suggests, the email account lasts for only 10 minutes.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="10_minute_mail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/10_minute_mail_thumb.png" border="0" alt="10_minute_mail" width="406" height="367" />][3]

## <a href="http://10minutemail.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://10minutemail.com/', '10 Minute Mail']);" >10 Minute Mail</a> Features

  * When you visit the URL, a temporary email address is automatically created.
  * This can be copy-pasted anywhere. The email notification can be see at the page itself. This email id self-destructs after 10 minutes.
  * A good thing is if you need another 10 minutes then that option also exists.

Over years there have been a lot of filters, court orders and more to deal with email spam. Fact is spam seems to just keep increasing. This is why I think it is better we use innovative services like **10 Minute Mail**. What are your views ? Do drop in your comments.
