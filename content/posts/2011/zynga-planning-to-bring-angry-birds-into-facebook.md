Do you think this game will be as successful as Farmville or Cityville ? Well, according to what I think it will. There are many who wish to play this game. People who are not so tech savvy in buying mobile phones they hae always heard about the game and thought if they could play it. ðŸ˜›

I am one of those, who wish to at least try the game once. Initially there will be a lot of people playing this game on Facebook. Though I do have one doubt in mind that being a single player game how Facebook is going to make it a multi player one. Will the angry birds plant seeds and wait for their neighbours to fertilize them. ðŸ˜› Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s in store with us. Share your ideas of angry birds with me.
