Now it has realized the need to fight this menace together with users and hence developed a Chrome extension called **Personal Blocklist**.

The extension shall work only for Google Chrome users at present and shall let them block malicious and spam listings directly from Google results. Such blocked results shall never appear again in their search in the future.

However this does not mean that the result itself shall be blocked throughout Google servers. That is not going to happen, instead any blocked results shall be automatically reported to Google and it will just guide the companyâ€™s staff to filter and decide things accordingly.

After blocking that website, see what happens:

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="DW adblock3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/02/DW-adblock3_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="DW adblock3" width="623" height="433" />][3]

Users can even *unblock* or edit a blocked website directly from their Chrome toolbar using the extension icon as commonly done. We all hope Google finds this a way out to filter most of the spam on Earth and our search becomes spam free.

Drop in your comments and let me know if you are using this new extension.
