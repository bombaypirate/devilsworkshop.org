Google has recently announced that it has acquired the mobile maker Motorola. This acquisition is valued at $12.5 billion. Google has bought Motorola with an eye towards powering Android. I guess they feel having a mobile manufacturer in their portfolio would make them less reliant on other manufacturers.

Here is a quote from Google’s <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html', 'blog post']);" >blog post</a> about the acquisition.

> Motorola’s total **commitment to Android** in mobile devices is one of many reasons that there is a natural fit between our two companies. Together, we will create amazing user experiences that **supercharge the entire Android ecosystem** for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers everywhere.

## What will this mean for competitors?

The problem with Android has been, that it has not managed to get manufacturers with really very successful smart-phones with the exception of Samsung. Also making the phone and the OS, does seem to have obvious profitability. iPhones actually make Apple a lot of money for this reason, that they are not reliant on other manufactures or OS. Owning the complete chain makes sense.

What are your views? Will this be a new chapter in the Android vs iPhone saga? Do drop in your comments.
