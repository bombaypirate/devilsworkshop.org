When someone utters the word “Apple” most times you think of the name “Steve Jobs”. The Apple CEO – Steve Jobs has a brand value which is synonymous with Apple. Apple has been smart to push Steve Jobs as their main spokesperson because Steve Jobs is a name everyone trusts and there is also the ‘Wow’ factor attached to him. Steve Jobs has been called a visionary and a creative genius. A couple of days ago Steve Jobs decided to take a leave of absence to deal with health issues. He had done this before in 2009 to get a liver transplant.

The immediate effect on Apple was seen on its stocks. They fell over 5% in one trading day. The fall was probably not as dramatic as imagined before, probably because the announcement of Steve Jobs taking a leave was done on Monday when the markets in the U.S were closed.

## Will Apple keep innovating with Jobs on leave?

The main question is not about Apple’s stocks but it’s vision. Apple in that way is a one man show when it comes to showing vision. Apple does have its top executives and programming heads giving lectures or giving demos about their products. It is all done by Steve Jobs. If Steve Jobs is not with Apple,  will it survive?

The next few months will see Apple unveiling iPad 2 and other products. This will give us a good idea on how well Apple copes without Steve Jobs’ creative genius.

At the moment it looks like Apple health will be also tied to the health of its CEO Steve Jobs.
