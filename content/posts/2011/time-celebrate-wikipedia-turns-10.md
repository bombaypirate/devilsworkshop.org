I hope you all had a great time celebrating the New Year! What&#8217;s  more interesting is that your favorite information guide on the Internet, is very close to its 10th birthday on 15th January, 2011. Still confused? I am talking about none other than Wikipedia.

Today, Wikipedia doesn&#8217;t need a description. Still I will like all of you to know that recently it completed its fundraiser and successfully raised about US$ 16 million. Whuf&#8230; that&#8217;s a huge amount of money! What&#8217;s more important to know is that Wikipedia has its local chapters all throughout the World today with volunteers all across the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Folks, it&#8217;s just not news this time, but various local chapters of Wikipedia all throughout the world have planned of organizing events and meetings to celebrate the 10th birthday.

I am even planning to attend the <a href="http://ten.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ten.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune', 'Pune event']);" target="_blank">Pune event</a> which is planned as follows:
