We do love Facebook, and now other site that allows you to login through your Facebook account. Flickr now lets you login with your Facebook id.

Flickr developers said that they would be rolling out new improvements to make signing into Flickr much easier. Users can now login to their accounts using Google, Yahoo or Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The members that use Facebook or Google as their login ID can now also start sharing their public photo uploads to Facebook. Wow that is great, isn&#8217;t it ? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> To be able to do that you need to check your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/account?tab=extend" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/account?tab=extend', 'accounts settings ']);" >accounts settings </a> page.
