I use Windows Live Writer for blogging and for normal writing I basically use Notepad or Word. These apps are fully featured with no space left for inspiration, you actually get distracted due to too many features and UI.  
**Ommwriter Dana** is one of the simplest writing apps available for Windows. It is something you haven&#8217;t experienced before.

  * Ommwriter is developed with two things in mind, one is focus and the another one is inspiration.
  * The interface is extremely simple, it basically runs in full screen mode with a drag-able text editor.
  * You don’t get bored while writing on Ommwriter, as there’s a slow pleasant background music playing, currently there are 3 sound tracks in it (each of them last for 15 minutes).
  * The background is customizable too, with 3 background patterns available.
  * Not at all feature rich, as I said it&#8217;s developed to be simple and it is.

For better concentration and focus you can put on head phones. Ommwriter is a must have for writers, bloggers, poets and everyone who has a brain which can think.
