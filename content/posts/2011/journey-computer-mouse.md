The Mouse is considered to be an integral part of a Computer with most of the functions requiring the Mouse to be executed. A Laptop computer comes with a Touchpad however many people still find the Traditional mouse more comfortable. Today’s mouse is result of the continuous development and evolution which happened since 1963 when the prototype of the first Mouse was developed by Douglas Engelbart at the Stanford Research Institute with his colleague Bill English.

It was not later than 1972 when Bill English (the co-inventor of the First mouse) build the Mechanical Ball mouse while working at XEROX PARC. This mouse had a Roller ball to move easily over a smooth surface.

Eventually with further Technological advancements, Roller ball mouse was replaced with Optical mouse which uses a light-emitting diode and photodiodes to detect any movement. This is easy to use than the ball mouse as there is no requirement of any kind of fixed surface. Due to no physical contact with the surface, this kind of mouse has a much longer life when compared with its ancestor kind. Hence it is one of the widely used mouse today.

What else was left has already come to the market, and is replacing the Optical and roller ball mouse pretty quickly. It is the wireless Optical mouse which uses Infrared / radio waves (even Bluetooth) to transmit signals to the computer when it detects movement. The receiver is usually a small device connected to the computer using the Serial port or USB. This kind of mouse requires additional battery (even rechargeable) for operation.

And this is how Today’s new generation mouse looks like
