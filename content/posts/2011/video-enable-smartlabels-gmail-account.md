Despite such issues, I still find Gmail as a better email service than Hotmail or Yahoo. One reason is because we can create filters and label certain similar emails based on Subject and email sender.

Google has announced a lab feature called SmartLabel which quickly creates a notification label and applies it to emails automatically.

## SmartLabels in Gmail Labs

  * Just look up under settings and click on Labs.
  * In GMail Labs, search for ‘SmartLabels’ and you will be shown the smart labels feature. Enable it and save the changes.
  * Once SmartLabels is enabled, similar emails are automatically sorted out and you can find them under a new label called notification.

*Here is a short video on how to go about it:*  


This is a nice improvement for users who are not using Filters. I have an alternate Gmail account which does get a few updates from subscriptions and also get some personal mail. Because I do not use this account everyday, I was lazy enough to not take time and create filters on this account. I found SmartLabels a better alternative.
