ASCII art is very popular on the web. The text-based drawing of diagrams are quite amusing. Actually drawing these diagrams in ASCII with a notepad would be very tedious.

Not to worry, <a href="http://www.asciiflow.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.asciiflow.com/', 'ASCII Flow']);" >ASCII Flow</a> is a nice online tool, that geeks will love.

Just lookup ***ASCII Flow*** and start drawing free hand a diagram. There are various options which include saving the diagram and embedding it with HTML code.

This website was created by a Google Adsense Engineer Lewis Hemes. In the future, it is expected to have a gallery of the ASCII art saved on the website.

In the case you only want a quite ASCII generator of text you insert, then try <a href="http://www.network-science.de/ascii/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.network-science.de/ascii/', 'ASCII Generator']);" >ASCII Generator</a>.

So go ahead and try out these tools, feed the geek in you and drop in your comments.
