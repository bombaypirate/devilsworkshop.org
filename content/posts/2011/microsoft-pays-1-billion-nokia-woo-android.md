What comes more amazingly is the unique deal Microsoft has signed with Nokia to keep competitors away. It may give the Mobile phone market an entire re-direction!

&nbsp;

Now coming over to the deal gossip, what’s important here is that Microsoft just paid over **US$ 1 billion** to Nokia Corporation to bid a deal with them.

The company says it is just a part of the promotion and development fee it is paying to the latter. However it can be also considered as a **cold cash **paid to avoid Google’s bulge in the deal.

## What does Nokia do in return?

What is Nokia going to do in return is something interesting, a fee for each copy of the Mobile OS it uses on its devices. Interesting, isn’t?

Now what everyone is waiting for the kind of devices Nokia brings out in the market and whether it will be a true competitor to Google’s Android! Because after a billion dollars I am sure Nokia will be not tempted to go with Android for any of their smart phones.
