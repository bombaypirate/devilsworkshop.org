Blogger had earlier this month announced that it was going to start unveiling new features. WordPress might be the platform of choice for professional bloggers but there are literally millions of casual bloggers who write and create content as a hobby.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39296" title="Blogger_logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/04/Blogger_logo.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" />][1]

Obviously they are looking for simple solutions when it comes to tweaking layouts and [Blogger has realized that by giving some new additions][2].

First they added the follow by email gadget which allows people to [follow a blogspot blog via email][3]. Now they are introducing a new layouts or views with endless scrolling. This seems to be borrowed for the new Google Image search layout.

Here is a video demo of Blogger Dynamic Views



## Get Dynamic View on Blogger

  * At the moment these views are not included as themes or as default views on Blogger templates.
  * But any Blogger blog can be viewed in the new Dynamic views by just adding **&#8220;/view&#8221;** in front of the URL.
  * For example, if your blogger blog is on “**example.com**” then to get the dynamic views just type in “**example.com/view**”.

Do you think this will prop up Blogger? I still feel that when it comes to blogging professionally, WordPress does a better job. Also when you write on Blogspot the content does stay on Google’s servers rather than, you hosting your own content which can be done with WordPress.
