[Samsung had initially introduced its new Galaxy Tab 7.7 in Berlin][2], which they had to remove from an exhibition, following a court order.

Apple has taken Samsung to court suggesting that, Galaxy Tab infringes on their design of iPad 2.

Today courts in Germany, have banned Samsung from selling Galaxy Tabs 10.1 in Germany and Samsung Germany is banned from selling them anywhere in Europe.

## Is Apple fighting fair?

On the face of it, I think the answer to that question is ‘No’. This seems like a loose interpretation of design rights. I mean Apple is not exactly suing Samsung for copying their code or their hardware design but is suggesting Samsung copied their style.

Even Google, whose Android OS might be hit because of these cases, have expressed that these a lot of these patents owned by Apple and Microsoft could be misused to thwart competition.

I am reminded of a quote from the film ‘Social Network’ where the character of Mark Zuckerberg defends himself saying “A guy who makes a nice *chair* doesn&#8217;t owe money to everyone who has ever built a *chair”*

So if Apple gets away with this, will other tablet producers be also sued? What are your views? Do drop in your comments.

Thanks to ***Nishant Soni*** for the tip.
