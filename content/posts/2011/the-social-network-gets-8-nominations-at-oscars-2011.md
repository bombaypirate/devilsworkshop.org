Well yes the time has come when the most awaited award Oscar&#8217;s nominations are made. I am really happy to see so many nominations for the movie &#8216;The Social Network&#8217;.

The movie got in total 8 nominations . For best actor Jesse Eisenberg , Jeff Cronenweth for cinemetography , David Fincher for direction, Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter for film editing, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for music( original score), Scott Rudin, Dana Brunetti, Michael De Luca and Ceán Chaffin, Producers for best picture, Ren Klyce, David Parker, Michael Semanick and Mark Weingarten for sound mixing and  Aaron Sorkinin for Screenplay. Wow so many nominations. I guess this is going to rock the Oscars.

I personally think the actor Jesse Eisenberg should get the best actor award because I loved his acting in the movie. Every bit of what he was saying appeared to be true and well, he portrayed Mark Zuckerberg real well. Besides that the original background score of movie was awesome.

What do you think ? Will the movie win at Oscars ? How many awards is it going to win out of those 8 nominations ? Do share your thoughts with me.
