HTC has unveiled a new tablet which will probably start comparisons with other top tablets out there. iPad opened up the market in 2010 for tablet computers in a big way, and that niche of the industry has grown like never before. HTC EVO view 4G is a 7 inch tablet which looks impressive and has a lot of novel features, but it does have an out-dated OS and no dual core processor.

## HTC EVO View 4G Specs

  * **Processor**: 1.5 GHz processor MSM8655. **(no dual core)**
  * **Operating** **System**: Android 2.3 with HTC Sense for tablet. **(No Android 3.0 Gingerbeard meant for tablet devices)**
  * **Internal Memory**: 4 GB
  * **Display**: 7‚Äù inch 1024 X 600 resolution
  * **Camera**: Two cameras with 5 megapixel with auto-focus
  * **Battery**: 4000 mAh Lithium battery

A glance at their tablet specs shows that with Android 2.3 (most recent android tablets in the next few months will have Android 3.0 Gingerbread version) on a tablet will be quite out-dated.

Also with lack of dual core processor, I think this tablet could have been fine last year but surely not in 2011. Check the <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-tablets-compete-ipad-2-2011/" target="_blank">competition for iPad in 2011</a>.
