We all know that the new Facebook profile lets us use Facebook in a creative way, but some people are not happy with the new profile. They want the old profile back. So this is how to get your old Facebook Profile back.

I do like the new Facebook profile but there are some parts that I do not like. Things like tag photos and all. The old one was pretty better.

## How to get your old Facebook Profile back?

->Go to Account.

->Click on Account Settings.

->At the end of that page you will see Deactivate Account.

->Click on Deactivate.

->It gives you a set of options to click.

->Select option &#8220;This is temporary I will be back.&#8221;

->Click on Confirm.

->It asks you your password and social CAPTCHA.

->After giving all the information, your account is disabled.
