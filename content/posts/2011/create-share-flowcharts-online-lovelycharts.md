Now a days many people work from home. They also collaborate and work with people who are not in the same place. Sometimes there is a need for drawing a quick flowchart to explain work flow or even a diagram to explain things better. This is where online tools that allow creating diagrams are in demand.

If you are looking to make flowcharts, sitemaps and diagrams online, then **Lovely Charts** is a great service.

  * Registration to the site is free but we have to register.
  * Once done I could save the charts I created. I can also import it as a .png or .jpg images.
  * The various options with these charts were very useful. Also creating flowcharts was really easy. All I had to do was drag and connect two objects automatically.

There is also a desktop version but then, that product is a paid service. I won&#8217;t recommend this as a way to create mind-maps as I prefer using [these online tools][1].

Do try out Lovely Charts and drop in your views and comments.
