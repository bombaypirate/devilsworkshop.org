Most internet users have a dynamic IP address when they connect to the internet. But sometimes, users might opt for getting a static IP address from their ISP. There are some advantages of using a static IP address, one of them being it allows users to keep working even if DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is down. It also helps to run servers on a static IP.

There is a small problem with a static IP addresses, that is sometimes they could be blacklisted on anti-spam databases.
