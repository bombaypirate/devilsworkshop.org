If you&#8217;re a Chrome fan, [like me][1], you must have installed any of the bleeding edge versions of Chrome, be it Chrome Dev, Canary or even Chromium. The Chrome team has worked on a new start page since a month and starting from Chrome Dev, all the upper channels can use that feature now.

[<img class="size-full wp-image-43244 alignnone" title="The new start page" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/08/Image-002.png" alt="" width="566" height="300" />][2]

## What&#8217;s new in this start page?

Everything! Yes, they have changed everything. The new start page&#8217;s UI looks a lot like a tablet interface. Here are its features.

  * The thumbnails of most visited sites are much bigger and cleaner now with respective favicons  on them.
  * Initially, the start page is divided into 3 sections &#8211; Most Visited, Apps and Bookmarks.
  * However, you can make new sections by dragging the site from Most Visited section into a new section, you can rename it.

</div>

  * You can rename the sections by double clicking the tab and changing it to whatever you want. Note that you can&#8217;t rename Most Visited and Bookmarks tab.
  * You can remove a site from most visited by dragging into Remove From Chrome box.

</div>

  * You can find the list of closed tabs from the Recently Closed menu on the extreme bottom-right.
  *  The Bookmarks tab showcases your bookmarks visually.

<div>
  You can add some good effects to the new start page by enabling &#8220;New Apps Install Bubble&#8221; in <em><a href="chrome://flags/">about:flags</a></em>
</div>
