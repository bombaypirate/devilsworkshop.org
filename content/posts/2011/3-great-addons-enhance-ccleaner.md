CCleaner is the most preferred system junk cleaner and one of the top reasons is its features can be extended using 3rd party Add-ons. These Add-ons can make CCleaner less annoying and even these are portable. Hereâ€™s a list of the 3rd party Add-ons for CCleaner which are worth checking!

## #1. Click and Clean

In CCleaner, to delete browser junk (cache,cookies etc), you need to close the browser but with Click and Clean browser extension installed you can delete your browser cache, history etc when itâ€™s running. Itâ€™s also available as a desktop application. Its desktop application looks pointless to me, because it does nothing except removing prompts while cleaning the junk with CCleaner. The browser extension works with IE, Firefox and Chrome.

## #2. CCEnhancer

Generally, CCleaner doesnâ€™t support cleaning junk from 3rd party applications (excluding browsers and Adobe flash) but with CCenhancer you can delete temporary files, logs created by over 500 3rd party applications and thus you can gain more disk space! ðŸ˜‰ The program is updated with new rules regularly so make sure you run the downloader occasionally.

## #3. CC Auto Updater

With CC Auto Updater you can automatically update all Piriform softwares installed on your system including CCleaner, Recuva, Defraggler and Speccy. You can either add to system startup or even specify date and time to schedule the updates. As Piriform updates CCleaner regularly this tool might come handy for Piriform fans. It doesn&#8217;t install on Windows XP SP2 but hopefully it supports Windows XP (SP1 and SP3), Vista and 7.
