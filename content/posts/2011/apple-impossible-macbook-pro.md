I did make a fuss about it and finally it happened. I am talking about the <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/apple-5-macbook-pros-launch-24th-february/" target="_blank">MacBook Pros launch</a> which finally happened on 24th February and just as the¬†rumor¬†said, 5 models in three categories: 13‚Äù, 15‚Äù and 17‚Äù are launched.

I did go through the technical sheet for each of them and found that while there are 2 sub-models each under 13‚Äù and the 15‚Äù models, the 17‚Äù model is unique. Each of them gives you 7 hours of un-interrupted battery even while wireless web surfing. I think writing anything about ‚ÄúUnibody‚Äù would not be justified, so I am including this video below.

> Just look above at the text I have marked in bold, you will see AMD alongwith Intel in Graphics section. Apple has done the magic of bringing together two parallel technologies with automatic graphics switching. Though I myself own a PC, I have started falling in love with Apple, no doubt even you deserve to fall for it üòâ
