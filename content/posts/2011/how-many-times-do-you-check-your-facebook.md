So, how many times do you login to your Facebook account and see who has messaged you , what are the updates and all? Well, this is kind of &#8216;in&#8217; when a person replies to a status update as soon as it is updated.

So are you among those people who are 24/7 online on Facebook either it is on their computers, laptops or mobile phones or the one who care less! The percentage of people who care less are really hard to find. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I just came across this image on internet.

As you can see in the image the woman wants to get to a computer just because she wants to check in to Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is the Facebook addiction taking over us ? Instead of asking money or shelter or food she wants a computer to see her Facebook profile.

How many times do you login to see your Facebook wall and are you addicted to it? I guess there will be Facebook addiction centers for recovery of those people who are severely addicted to it. ðŸ˜€ Share your thoughts with me.
