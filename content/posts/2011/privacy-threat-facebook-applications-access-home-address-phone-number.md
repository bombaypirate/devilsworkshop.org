This is strange. Well, Facebook users can choose to lock these things under privacy settings. It clearly says that the data will be made available of the user only, it wont affect user&#8217;s friends and family but you never know. What troubles me most is that you are never sure of security on internet. Even if everything has been chosen private we are not sure when will Facebook choose to make it all public.

I know many people who are not a Facebook fan just for the security reasons. They don&#8217;t like the idea of sharing each and everything online that too on Facebook. Imagine a person making Â a bad application and taking everyone&#8217;s personal address and phone number. He can easily spam people and you wont see that coming. Thieves will have an awesome time looking for addresses. ðŸ˜€

## The best way to avoid Privacy threat ?

  * Never allow an application before reading what is it asking you. Precaution is always better than cure. Just see once what this application can cost you.
  * Keep your phone number, address and important information private.
  * Best way is to not mention such things. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Whats the use of writing something you Â may regret later. Facebook is for people to share experiences, images not phone numbers.

So, what do you think ? Do you think Mr Zuck is taking care of its 600 million user&#8217;s privacy ? I am really afraid of this step, and I don&#8217;t want to be a Facebook hater. Please Mark listen! Do share in your views.
