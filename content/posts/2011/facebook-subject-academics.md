I have always been having a dream of having Facebook as a subject in my academics . I gave my imagination a little freedom and here is what I think might happen.

### If Facebook were a subject in my academics

  1. Mark Zuckerberg would have been our Principal.
  2. Blue is the color code &#8211; Our principal is color blind, you know&#8230;
  3. Notebooks are replaced by Facebook Notes, Text books with E-books.
  4. Sarcasm would have been our second language.
  5. Writing on wall isn&#8217;t a crime anymore.
  6. Freedom for poking.
  7. Right to share.
  8. We hate Google (Yeah, ONLY if Facebook were a subject in my academics ðŸ˜‰ )
  9. When we write exams, hackers will be the invigilators.
 10. We&#8217;ll create fake profiles of our teachers and SUE them with vulgar language.

Well these are some funny thoughts originating in my mind. Do drop in your comments your points of view, your appreciation, your criticism. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
