According to them, they think that Facebook&#8217;s founder Mark Zuckerberg ditched the brothers and gave them less settlement. They gave $US65 million as the settlement of the lawsuit. Facebook was recently valued at $US50 billion.

So, the twin brothers think they have been ditched. The twins signed a settlement two years ago that gave them $US20 million in cash and $US45 million worth of stock valued at $US36 a share.

What do you think? Do you think that they have been ditched? I don&#8217;t think that is the case. The brothers are just stretching this all. Even if it was their idea, who developed it? Share your views with me through the comments below.
