If you are using Windows 7, there is a good chance that while copy-pasting files from one folder to another, there may be two files with similar names. Considering copy-paste is one of the most used commands on any platform, Windows 8 tries to change the way people will approach copy-paste jobs.

With Windows 7, users get the options “Copy and Replace” , “Don’t Copy” and “Copy, but keep both files”.

I usually like to use the third option and then go over both files at some later time (which never happens :-P).

Windows 8 is changing how people resolve conflicting file names. Users will get the option to choose the files they want to be saved individually (see image below).

This will help users to actually select which versions of the files they want or keep both versions. According to official Windows 8 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/23/improving-our-file-management-basics-copy-move-rename-and-delete.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/23/improving-our-file-management-basics-copy-move-rename-and-delete.aspx', 'post']);" >post</a>, they plan to let users manage all copy jobs from a single place.

Windows 8 will be crucial for Microsoft, and new approach to file management is a good idea. What are your views? Do drop in your comments.
