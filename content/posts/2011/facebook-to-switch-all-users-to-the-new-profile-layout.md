Whether you like it or not you will get a new profile on Facebook. Today I saw a notification on my Facebook profile saying that my old profile will be changed to Facebook very soon.

Earlier it was an option for people if they want it to be changed or not. Not anymore. Facebook will be changing each and every profile to the new one slowly.

I had written about <a href="http://fbknol.com/solvedhow-to-get-your-old-facebook-profile-layout/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/solvedhow-to-get-your-old-facebook-profile-layout/', 'how to change it back']);" >how to change it back</a>, but I guess now that wont work! There is no way to get back your old profile or stick with it if you don&#8217;t want the new one. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

There can be many ways to enjoy this new profile. As you all know the creative side of this profile totally rocks. It is now so easy to turn your profile page into a masterpiece <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-make-a-creative-photo-profile-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-make-a-creative-photo-profile-on-facebook/', '(source)']);" >(source)</a>. This profile has a lot of good points alsoÂ <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-profile-designs-screenshots/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-profile-designs-screenshots/', ' ( Source)']);" > ( Source)</a> . <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

People are so much addicted to Facebook that it&#8217;s really hard to accept any changes in it. But I am sure we all will get used to it and love the profile page as it is. Share your views with me through the comments below.
