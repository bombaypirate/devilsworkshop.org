Facebook is behaving in a weird way lately. I was commenting on my friend&#8217;s photo on Facebook and it didn&#8217;t let me do it, saying it contains blocked content.

Today when I was writing a text for my friend on her photograph, Facebook prompted me with a pop up saying

> This message contains blocked content that has previously been flagged as abusive or spammy. Let us know if you think this is an error.

As you can see the image below, the message is being blocked from sending.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/bugfacebook-not-allowing-to-post-comments-on-photo/message-falied-on-facebook-2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/bugfacebook-not-allowing-to-post-comments-on-photo/message-falied-on-facebook-2/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-4951"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4951" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Message-falied-on-Facebook1.png" alt="" width="462" height="133" /></a>

As my message was not a spam I clicked on Let us know and I was taken to a new page where they asked what message I typed and a set of questions.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/bugfacebook-not-allowing-to-post-comments-on-photo/blocked-content-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/bugfacebook-not-allowing-to-post-comments-on-photo/blocked-content-on-facebook/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-4952"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4952" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Blocked-content-on-Facebook.png" alt="" width="519" height="442" /></a>

When I had entered all the information and clicked on submit, Facebook prompted that the query has been successfully submitted and they will contact me through mail.

Did anyone else also experience such problem? If yes then what did you do? What do you think the cause may be. Share your views on it through the comments below. I am waiting for Facebook to reply now. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
