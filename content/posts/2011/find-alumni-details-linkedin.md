LinkedIn unlike other social networks, has not lost is razor-sharp focus of being a network only for professional profiles. Most recruiters and job seekers usually make sure their LinkedIn profiles are upto date. I found a nice LinkedIn tool that allows people to find their alumni details.

It is very useful to know where people, who we went to school or college with are upto.

  * Sign-into your LinkedIn profile and visit the alumni page (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/college" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkedin.com/college', 'http://www.linkedin.com/college']);" >http://www.linkedin.com/college</a>).
  * The page will related information of your alumni from the college you have listed in your profile.
  * You can move around the year people attended to include info on seniors and juniors you might be knowing.
  * The information displayed is where people work, what they do and where they live.

## How one could use this information!

Many recruiters use LinkedIn to get information about candidates. This tool could a nice way to see if someone you went to school or college with, works in a company you are joining so you could ask them how the work culture of that company is.

Another use could be to see if you college friends are in a particular city you are visiting or staying in.

Do try it out and drop in your comments.
