The requisite haiku rounding up stragglers last few bugs for 3.1

As *Andrew Nacin* said that for WordPress RC1, release candidates are the last stop before the final release. It means they are done and have no bugs to squash. But with millions of users, many server configurations and setups, and thousands of plugins and themes, it is still possible they can miss something.

Since Beta 1 came on Thanksgiving, RC1 on Christmas, and RC2 on New Year’s Day. They will not be waiting for another holiday for the final release, so if you have not tested WordPress 3.1 yet, now get ready to test it

If you are a developer and interested in testing the release candidate and if you find a bug, there are a few ways to let them know :

  * Post it to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/', 'Alpha/Beta area in the support forums']);" >Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>
  * Report it to the <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers', 'wp-testers mailing list']);" >wp-testers mailing list</a>
  * Join the development IRC channel and tell them live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev
  * File a bug ticket on the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://core.trac.wordpress.org/', 'WordPress Trac']);" >WordPress Trac</a>

You can test WordPress 3.1 using <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/', 'WordPress Beta Tester plugin']);" >WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a>. If any known issues are there, you can <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5', 'find them here']);" >find them here</a>.
