[<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41822" title="Google_plus_logo.png" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/Google_plus_logo-200x200.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" />][1]As a blogger I often like to use [Digsby to get desktop notifications in real-time from Facebook and Linked In][2]. At the moment Digsby does not support Google+, but there is a new desktop client for Windows users named GClient.

I have used it and I found it quite useful to stay in touch with what my friends are sharing on Google+. It also is a nice way to quickly type in an update, without the need of using my browser.

### <a href="http://www.abelssoft.net/gclient.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.abelssoft.net/gclient.php', 'GClient']);" >GClient</a> Windows for Google+

  * Download the software, and install it. It will need your Windows OS to have .NET Framework 4.0 installed on it. If your computer does not have [.NET 4.0, get offline downloader here.][3]
  * Once installed, type in your email address and get the License Code for registering the software.
  * After the Registration Code is inserted the GClient for Google+ can be seen in an icon in the system tray.

I have not used this desktop application for more than a few days, but it is quite useful if you are addicted to Google+. In case you still prefer using your browser then look up these [10 great app and extensions][5].

Do try out GClient and drop in your comments.
