While the Indian government has regularly made noises about online content being screened, the suggestion from the minister that human beings should be used to screen content instead of automatic checks. This demand is a little strange and quite impractical.

With over millions of hours of video content generated and billions of blog posts published a year, it would require thousands of people to actually screen such content manually.

What is more interesting is that the government has not defined what is inflamatory and is asking the companies to take do it themselves.

## Criticism for the move

Kapil Sibal’s comment have been made fun of on social media websites like Twitter and Facebook. It is ironic that what he set out of control was dished out to him.

Politicians are often criticized about their views and made fun of on social media websites. It is next to impossible to try and control the internet.

Clarifications have come in that the government is not looking to censor online content. I guess we have not heard the last of this issue as most governments around the world are looking for some sort of control over content.

I do not like any sort of censorship on the internet. It kills creativity and dialogue. In my opinion governments should not try to find ways to censor or control the internet but actually use internet tools to reach out to people and get their opinions.

What are your views? Do drop in your comments.
