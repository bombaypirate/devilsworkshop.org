Today I saw that my friend has a lot of comments on his photograph on Facebook. When I tried to open the comments only, on my wall Facebook took me to the photograph!

Now, this is irritating ! If some one wants to see the comments only why should they see the image and all. The <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-photo-feature-finally/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-photo-feature-finally/', 'new photo feature']);" >new photo feature</a> is kind of time-consuming, it just shows you the total black screen for some time and then the photo.

It takes more time to load, kind of weird! If you want to unable this kind of photo viewing <a href="http://fbknol.com/view-photos-old-facebook-layout/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/view-photos-old-facebook-layout/', 'read this']);" >read this</a>. Anyways, did you also find this feature irritating ? Share your likes n dislikes with me.
