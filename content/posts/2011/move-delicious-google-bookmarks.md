Then came the news that [Yahoo will not shut down Delicious but sell it][3]. I even wrote an [open letter to Google suggesting they should buy Delicious][4]. Google Bookmarks is not really setting the world on fire, but if Delicious did close down, then I would be tempted to move all my bookmarks to Google Bookmarks.

<a href="http://delicious-export.appspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://delicious-export.appspot.com/', 'Delicious-export']);" ><strong>Delicious-export</strong></a> is a nifty tool that allows you to move your bookmarks from Delicious to Google.

Initially I looked up the export facility with Delciious and then the file to Google. I found this a little complicated. Delicious –export is a web app that makes life a lot easier.

  * The login facility is available for both Yahoo users and also old Delicious account users.
  * The bookmarks are moved quite fast. I also had the option of selecting or deselecting certain bookmarks while moving the bookmarks to Google.
  * A really good feature was that all the tags from delicious bookmarks were converted to Labels for Google Bookmarks. This is really handy.

So just in case you suffer from a lack of confidence on Yahoo and it’s designs for Delicious bookmarking service, this web app is a great way to backup all these bookmarks to Google.
