Yes now you can purchase a Facebook keyboard in $30. Sounds nice!

<a href="http://www.socialkeyboards.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.socialkeyboards.com/', 'Social Keyboards']);" >Social Keyboards</a> has developed the Social Network Access Keyboard (SNAK). SNAK, costs $30, is a typical multimedia USB keyboard with 104 keys, 19 of which are hotkeys dedicated just for Facebook. When you sign out of the social network, the hotkeys are disabled.
