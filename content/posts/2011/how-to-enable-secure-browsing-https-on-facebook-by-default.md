Recently Facebook launched secure browsing and social authentication. (<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-secure-login-and-picture-captcha/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-secure-login-and-picture-captcha/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>) Then they said it will be soon rolled out to all the accounts, so well, here it is. I got this secure browsing feature on my Facebook account today morning.

## How to enable Secure browsing (HTTPS) ?

  * Go to Account-> Account Settings.
  * Click on Account Security.
  * You will see the option for secure browsing.
  * Check the box.
  * Click on Save.

Enable the settings exactly the same way in which I have done.

As you can see in the image above, I have enabled secure browsing whenever possible. This is a good way to secure your account if you login from  different places that is cyber café or somebody else&#8217;s computer. I have also checked on the option for informing me when I login from a different computer. It asks me the name and sends me the email. You can also choose this option to keep a check on your Facebook logins. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Best thing I found out after using this secure browsing is that it doesn&#8217;t let you use the applications. Some spam that come on your Facebook, it does not let you click on them. If you click on any of the links you get a message saying

> Sorry! We can&#8217;t display this content while you&#8217;re viewing Facebook over a secure connection (HTTPS).

This is like an alert, do you really wish to click ? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I think this will cut the number of spam any way. What do you think ? Share your views with me on this ?
