Recently I had written about how to use bold or underlined font in Facebook chat (<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-use-boldunderlined-fonts-in-facebook-chat/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-use-boldunderlined-fonts-in-facebook-chat/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>) . Today I will tell you about how to use these in a Facebook status update. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Facebook now has an application that lets you write message and post it Italics, squared or bold way.

## What the application does ?

  * You can choose the format of writing from bold, italics, squared, cloudy, boxy or strike out.
  * You can choose the font.
  * You can choose it to display on your wall or your friend&#8217;s wall.
  * you can Preview, clear or send the text.

### How to use the Bold text application ?

  * Go to the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/bold-text/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/bold-text/', 'application']);" >application</a>.
  * Choose the font.

I liked the application. Try the app and let me know how did you find it.
