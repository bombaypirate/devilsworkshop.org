With a declared talk-time battery of upto 14 hours, Samsung in its recent launch “Wave 533” aka “Wave 2 Pro” has used **Bada **as the Operating system. The phone is a slider keyboard phone with touchscreen feature.

Let me clarify one thing here itself that Wave 533 **does not support 3G network** unlike mentioned on many websites including Naaptol on the web. I inquired about this myself from **The Mobile Store** located in Pune and even they confirmed this. The video below will clarify that there is NO 3G network supported by Wave 533.
