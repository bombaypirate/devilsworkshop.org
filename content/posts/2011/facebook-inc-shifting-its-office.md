Facebook shifted its new office to the mostly abandoned former headquarters of  Sun Microsystems. Yesterday we were wondering what are Facebook&#8217;s plan (<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-event-8-feb-invited/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-event-8-feb-invited/', 'source']);" >source</a>) and finally we get to know about the new office.

The company has been based in Palo Alto since 2004, so now I guess it needed some change. Bigger office, more people, increasing employees hence the need of new office. Facebook will soon be announcing that they are shifting here, with a 57-acre place which was acquired by Sun in 2009.

There were rumors that Facebook owned 312 and 314 Constitution Avenue, a little less than a mile away from the main Sun Microsystems campus. I am still waiting for the official announcement from Facebook. Let&#8217;s see what happens. I will let you know.
