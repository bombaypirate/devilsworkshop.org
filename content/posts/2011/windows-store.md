Microsoft has been quite open about how Windows 8 will be build and what to expect from it. Recently it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2011/12/06/announcing-the-new-windows-store.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2011/12/06/announcing-the-new-windows-store.aspx', 'announced']);" >announced</a> Windows Store as a new offering on Windows 8 platforms. Windows Store will allow app developers to create apps on Windows 8 platform. As Windows 8 will run on tablets, phones and PCs, it will be a lucrative for developers. Windows 8 Beta will be released in February 2012, and it will feature Windows Store. The apps available on Windows 8 Beta will be only the free ones.

### How Windows Store will help developers

Microsoft is pulling out all stops to woo developers to create apps for Windows 8 platform. Developers will be paid **80%** of the revenues collected once the app makes **$25,000**. Otherwise Microsoft will part with **70%** of the revenues.

Windows 8 will run on millions of desktops, laptops, phones and tablets. So this will be a very good opportunity for app developers.

Apps on Windows 8 Store will also be available, to be used on even on trial basis if the developers choose to do so.

### Will Windows Store be successful?

Windows Store is an obvious attempt to compete with Apple’s App store. iPhone and iPad has given their users a lot of options and mobility. With Windows Store, Microsoft will be hoping to replicate that success over their much larger PC user-base and their growing mobile and tablet users-base.

It makes sense considering, users can choose to have Apps that sync on one platform which can run on various devices. Also if Windows 8 is supposed to compete as a OS for mobiles and tablets, it simply must have an app store to be lucrative.
