You might have noticed a major downtime today for Devils Workshop as well as other blogs in rtBlogs network.

We were pushing a major update where we merged all blogs in rtBlogs WordPress multisite insideÂ rtCamp&#8217;s WordPress multisite. The goal was to centralize our user&#8217;s login info so that they can easily contribute to our blog network, as well as use support forums at rtCamp&#8217;s product portals easily.

In the long run, you will be using a single account to:

  * ContributeÂ on [Devils Workshop][2], <a href="http://crictalks.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://crictalks.com/', 'Cric Talks']);" >Cric Talks</a>, <a href="http://cultaffair.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cultaffair.com/', 'Cult Affairs']);" >Cult Affairs</a> and future blogs that will get added in <a href="http://rtblogs.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com/', 'rtBlogs Network']);" >rtBlogs Network</a>
  * Post on Devils Workshop&#8217;s technical support forum *(coming soon)*
  * Use free support forum for rtCamp&#8217;s product sites like <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/support/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/support/', 'Blogger To WordPress Migration']);" >Blogger To WordPress Migration</a>, <a href="http://mediabp.com/support/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mediabp.com/support/', 'BuddyPress-Media Component']);" >BuddyPress-Media Component</a>, <a href="http://wpnginx.com/support/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpnginx.com/support/', 'WordPress-Nginx Setup']);" >WordPress-Nginx Setup</a>, <a href="http://rtpanel.com/support/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtpanel.com/support/', 'rtPanel WordPress Theme Framework']);" >rtPanel WordPress Theme Framework</a> & more
  * UseÂ <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/affiliate/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/affiliate/', 'affiliateÂ program at Blogger To WordPress Migration service']);" >affiliateÂ program at Blogger To WordPress Migration service</a> to make some money
  * A totally new web-app is on the way! More details later&#8230;.

  <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
</div>

Our current move many have some side-effects. So please check few things:

  * If you are using our Google AdSense Revenue Sharing program, please check your posts to see if they are displaying your ads.
  * Also check if your posts are attributed to you only
  * If you are not able to log in, try resetting your password with email-address you used at the time ofÂ registration.
  * If you see your user-name changes, please do not panic. We are expecting few usernames to be changed as we merged two user-bases.

<div>
  We have triple-checked many things, but still in a big community like this, things may go wrong. Whatever issue you may encounter, do NOT panic!
</div>

<div>
  You can use comment form below or <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/contact">our contact-form</a> to reach us. Please give as many details as possible while contacting for technical support (related to above issues).
</div>

While today&#8217;s changes will most likely go unnoticed for a while, we hope to surprise you with our next round of changes. The good thing about next round is, there will be no downtime! ðŸ˜‰
