Many of my Twitter friends share the music they’re listening to on Twitter and I like it. This makes Twitter a source of music, Twusic is a new startup which grabs all those music links from Twitter and you can listen to them and even re-tweet them directly from the site.

In a nut shell, Twitter + Music = Twusic.

## Features Of Twusic

  * With Twusic, you can listen and share your favorite music on Twitter.
  * There’s a tweet box on every page, you can edit the tweet before sharing it (make sure you authenticated the app).
  * You can also follow your tweeps on Twusic to get all their shared music on your *MusicLine.*
  * While listening to music, it gives a short bio of the artist and shows a few suggestions.
  * You can also create Playlists (click on *Add To Playlist* while listening to a song), Playlists will appear on your profile page.
  * You also get badges based on the number of followers (not Twitter followers) you get.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros: **A nice way to discover music and to keep track of them.

**Cons: **The site is a bit buggy, they must’ve replaced the video player with a music player (like Grooveshark). Even though the video player is taken from YouTube, you can’t customize it (pausing, maximizing to full screen etc).
