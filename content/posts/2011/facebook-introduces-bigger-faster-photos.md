Facebook once again changes it&#8217;s album photo size and the way Facebook shows it. The photos are now bigger and finally Facebook changed it&#8217;s black background photo viewer. The new size for the Facebook photos are 960 pixels (earlier it was 720 pixels) that means the new bigger photos are really that big! It&#8217;s gonna cover your whole screen so that person who&#8217;s viewing it will focus on the pic only as it will cover everything else on the page.

In the pic above you can see the difference between a 720 pixel and 960 pixel pictures. (For comparison only, not actual size).

The second change is that the photos now will be loaded faster with it&#8217;s new viewer. Also they changed the black background as we see in the current viewer. The new viewer will have a white background and the image will cover whole screen hiding the things in background.

Other options of Photo viewer are still the same. You still can&#8217;t right click on the photos and you have to click &#8216;download&#8217; for saving a picture to your desktop. Please note that this feature is not available for everyone yet and Facebook will be rolling out this to everyone within next few days.
