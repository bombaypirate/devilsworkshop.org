I liked it for the many options it gave.

Now recently on my personal blog, I have been using WebEngage (service created by WebKlipper), which allows creating the simple and easy feedback forms for visitors.

## WebEngage Features

  * After I created a WebEngage account, I could generate a widget. I could customize the look of the widget that would be seen with my blog.
  * The HTML code is created and all I needed to do, was copy and paste in footer region of my blog.

  * The Feedback button shows up as you can see in the image above. Click on it and it opens up a form which allows visitors to contact with their email ID, name and message.

  * Also the feedback is divided into categories, which are Like, Question, Suggestion and Problem.
  * Best part is users can even attach a screenshot of the page while contacting you.
  * Every time you get some feedback, the service sends you an email as notification.
