Facebook is planning to launch new commenting system soon. What I mean by this is that you will be able to comment on blogs or different platforms using your Facebook login or you page.

Comments can be &#8216;Liked&#8217; or voted up. the comments will be synced on the blog&#8217;s as well as the person&#8217;s wall. Something I don&#8217;t like here is to tell all my Facebook friends about where I commented and what I wrote there. Facebook will be needing some blog&#8217;s support for the launch, soon.

A Facebook spokesperson wrote,

> Based on feedback from developers about ways to improve our existing comments plugin, we&#8217;re testing an updated plugin that leverages authenticity and social relevancy to increase distribution. We&#8217;re testing the plugin on our Facebook blog and Developer blog but have no further details to share at this time.

Well, you must have seen this kind of commenting on their blogs, as said above. So, what do you think? Will this do any good ? Making your profile public is another thing, making your life so public? I don&#8217;t know. All of us do visit many blogs, read many things, we don&#8217;t put this as our status update. Do we? Do not forget to share your views with me on this.
