Some of them are useful, like Anti-Virus or Firewall applications, but most other applications are useless. I thought that the only way to do it is to uninstall that software, Windows 7 has a nice feature that allows removing some applications form running at start up.

## Unselect / Select Applications with msconfig

  * Click on *start (the windows icon*), in the *search *column, type in* &#8216;msconfig*&#8216; and select the &#8216;msconfig&#8217; program that appears.Â It&#8217;s a configuration option that microsoft had made to help users.

  * It will open a new window. If you want to disable all the start up item, you can deselect the &#8216;*Load startup Items*&#8216;, in the *general -> Selective Startup -> Load startup items* ( see the image). I don&#8217;t actually recommend it, because there will be several useful startup programs like security softwares and all. So, navigate to the tab &#8216;*Start up*&#8216;

  * Under the *startup* tab, you can see a list of all the programs that are designed to load at the Startup. You can individually stop these services by unselecting them.

Doing this can help you to stop those irritating startup programs like Gtalk, PC suites etc, which you might not use all the time and hence want it not to run by default every time you start the computer.

If you are using laptop then reducing this load on your computer will see a good increase in your computer&#8217;s speed along the battery lasting a lot longer. ðŸ˜‰
