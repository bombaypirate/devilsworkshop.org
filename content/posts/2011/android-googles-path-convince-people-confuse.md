This piece of post may not convince you well, but it will at least not confuse you unlike Google. Ever since Google came out with it’s Android for smartphones, the sale of Android phones has been on the rise (read <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/android-overtook-symbian-sales/" target="_blank">Android wins over Symbian sales</a>), but now it has started following the Google tagline – **“*if you can’t convince people, confuse them*”**!

## Version History of Android

  * Android 1.1
  * Android 1.5 – Cupcake
  * Android 1.6 – Donut
  * Android 2.0 – Eclair
  * Android 2.0.1 – Eclair
  * Android 2.1 – Eclair
  * Android 2.2 – Froyo
  * Android 2.3 – Gingerbread
  * Android 2.3.3 – Gingerbread
  * Android 3.0 – Honeycomb

This is how Google has officially declared it’s version history of Android. Out of all, the version 3.0 is specially optimized for tablets or devices with large screen sizes. Watch the video for Android 3.0 which says it’s specially created for tablets.

## Where the confusion starts?

  * Google recently announced that Android 2.4 will be launched this Summers, does that mean Google is going to develop Gingerbread upto 2.9 separately?
  * A <a href="http://www.pcworld.in/news/htc-flyer-7-inch-tablet-runs-android-24-45692011" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pcworld.in/news/htc-flyer-7-inch-tablet-runs-android-24-45692011', 'PC World report']);" target="_blank">PC World report</a> suggests that HTC announced its 7-inch Flyer tablet in the Mobile World Congress and you know what, it uses the Android 2.4 and not 3.0!!
  * Many reports suggest that Android 4.0 is to be named as “Icecream”, while a TechCrunch report says Android 2.4 to be named as “Icecream Sandwich”. I&#8217;m Confused!

I am not sure what Google inside story is, but finally the clear picture will be revealed only during the <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/update-countdown-begins-google-io-2011/" target="_blank">Google IO conference this year</a>. Do post your comments, and do you think Google is intentionally trying to trick everyone with it’s ice-cream gimmick just to keep talks going on?
