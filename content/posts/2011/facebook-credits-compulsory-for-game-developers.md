Facebook Credits are a virtual currency that are used in games to buy the things. If you are a regular game player on Facebook then you might have felt the need of Facebook credits.

From July 1 all the games should have Facebook Credits (<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/451" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/451', 'Source']);" >Source</a>). Well, Facebook will earn a lot more but I wonder how bad it is for gamers. When you see a new something introduced in your game you are pretty sure that is through Facebook Credits. Oh, the feeling of looking at it and not able to purchase it, hurts.

On the contrary, I think there should be the same type of goods for everyone. One who can buy them by Facebook credits great, else the other people should get it when their levels increase in the game. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What say. If you want to earn free Facebook credits you do have to invest a lot of time but you will get it <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-free-facebook-credits/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-free-facebook-credits/', '(Source)']);" >(Source)</a>.

The developers who will develop the games with more Facebook credits will receive early access to product features and premium promotion on Facebook, including featured placement on the Games Dashboard, premium targeting for ads, and access to new co-promotion opportunities. Facebook seems to be telling game developers that its their wayÂ or the highway. Eh!

Well, what do you think? Do you think people will continue playing games and put real cash into them? Do share your thoughts with me.
