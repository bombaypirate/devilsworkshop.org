Did I read the title right ? Can you now actually rent movies via Facebook ? Well yes, you can do this now!

Warner Bros. studio will begin renting movies directly through Facebook, starting with The Dark Knight, according to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-bros-rent-movies-digitally-165218" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-bros-rent-movies-digitally-165218', 'The Hollywood Reporter']);" rel="nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. To rent the movie users will just have to visit the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/darkknight" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/darkknight', 'movie page']);" >movie page</a>, and click on rental icon.

Wow, so easy and fast ! I guess very soon we will get all our work done through Facebook. Rentals will cost 30 Facebook credits, which equals $3. Renters will have 48 hours from the time of purchase to watch the movie before the rental expires.

Saddest part is that the rental feature is currently only available to the 30 percent of Facebook users who live in the US. I wonder when can we access it in India? Share your views with me on this.
