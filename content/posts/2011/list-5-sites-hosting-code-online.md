There are many websites which give you the platform for hosting your project codes online. I thought it would be nice to share a list with you.

## #1. <a href="http://code.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://code.google.com/', 'GoogleCode']);" target="_blank">GoogleCode</a>

The best place to keep your code is to put on the most trusted internet brand. Google Code not only hosts your code source but also provides various resources to you. Here you can find API and toolkits for various streams including the open source programs. It has a feature called code playground where, live online coding can be done and output can be seen. Google code is good platform for developers and for project hosting.
