**Facebook** has banned the sale of a **Mark Zuckerberg** doll, made by Made in Chinda Gadgets.

This doll is made by China Gadgets. Mark Zuckerberg is standing and holding a poke and like sign. This is kind of funny! This doll is making fun of our Social network&#8217;s CEO.

So I guess that is the reason, Facebook has banned the doll. I kind of like the doll. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This doll was being sold at $69.90, but it could have been the perfect gift for a Facebook addict.
