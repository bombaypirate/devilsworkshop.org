Just as I was going through my Facebook account today in the morning, I saw this news. One of my friend had shared this on Facebook. Facebook is closing down on 15 March 2011.

I am surprised with this news but still thinking why did they even spread this news. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> **Avrat Humarthi, **vice president for technical issues onÂ **Facebook said **

> ****After March 15 the entire site off.** **So, if you want to see the pictures again, I recommend you take them through the Internet. You can not get them back as soon as the order goes out of business.

In a news conference outside his office , Mark Zuckerberg said that he needs to stop Facebook as it is becoming too stressful. Users will no longer be able to access their Facebook accounts after 15.

A <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/A-Petition-To-Stop-Facebook-From-Shutting-Down/129291513751361" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/A-Petition-To-Stop-Facebook-From-Shutting-Down/129291513751361', 'Facebook page']);" >Facebook page</a> has already been started to ask Facebook not to shut down. So, what do you think? Will Facebook shut down any time in the future and that too so soon? If Facebook is closed what is your next alternative?
