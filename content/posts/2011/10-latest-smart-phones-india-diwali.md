During this Diwali festival, I have decided to go and get myself a new smart phone. I started to do a little research and came up with a list of phones I could potentially buy. In my research, I found 10 new phones that are out there. So I thought I will share this list and approximate prices with you; so if you are looking to buy a new phone it would helpful. So here is the list of 10 latest smart phones you can consider buying this Diwali.

## #1. Blackberry Bold 4 9900

[<img class="wp-image-50131" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: right;padding-top: 0px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/blackberry-bold-9900_thumb.png" alt="blackberry-bold-9900" width="220" height="220" align="right" border="0" />][1]The phone supports QWERTY keypad and has a touch screen. It does seem to be a phone meant for business with document viewer and Pushmail. It has a single 5 Megapixel camera.

Internal storage space is 8 Gb which is expandable to 32 Gb. It does have 768 MB RAM.

OS: BlackBerry 7 OS

Price: INR 33,000

I guess this phone is a little over-priced considering almost a similar phone BlackBerry Torch is priced a lot less.
