Most of the people have their pages as well on Facebook along with their profile. Some pages are with smaller number of fans but some are huge enough that people add anybody from page as it&#8217;s admin so that page can be managed by a small group of people like 3 or 4 persons. This posts tells you few reasons why you should keep your Facebook Pages with a single admin only. Check out the points below:

  * **Co-Admins can remove Actual Admin:** The worst thing about Facebook pages is that you can&#8217;t have an admin with lower privileges. Evey admin will have same power, that means if you make someone admin of your page, he can even remove you as the owner of that page. So it&#8217;s better if you admin your page yourself or make an admin someone you know personally. Never give administrator rights to a stranger from that page.
  * **Who updated the page:** If you keep more than 2 admins there will be a problem that nobody know who posted a particular update. What if somebody posted something abusive on that page? You can never figure out who posted that so administrator powers might get misused.
  * **Admin&#8217;s profile got hacked:** What if one of the admin&#8217;s profile got hacked? His profile as well as the page he admins both will be misused and even the hacker can remove you as admin or delete that page. But this might be beneficial too, what if your own profile got hacked? Co-Admin can save your page in that case ðŸ˜‰
  * **Changing Page settings:** Unfortunately you don&#8217;t get notifications while a co-admin changes anything in your page. Also you can&#8217;t check everything on daily basis to find out whether everything is fine or not. So keepÂ  your page&#8217;s settings to yourself only.

Please add a point if I missed something, also do tell us what are your views about Facebook pages?
