Facebook recently allowed people to share things publicly. It also introduced the option of [subscribing to public posts][1] from other people. It is a bit like Google Plus or Twitter which allows following publicly shared updates from a user without the need to connect directly.

The most astounding number forÂ subscriptions, has been clocked by Mark Zuckerberg. The reason it is surprising, is that even though equally celebrities on Facebook have hardly had even a million people subscribing to their updates.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/secret-mark-zuckerbergs-6-million-subscribers/mark_zuckerber_subscribe/" rel="attachment wp-att-45918"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45918" title="Subscribe Count on Mark Zuckerberg's profile" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/09/Mark_zuckerber_subscribe.png" alt="" width="550" height="298" /></a>

The trick to this huge number of subscribers is that, he has transformed all the people who &#8220;Liked&#8221; his Facebook Page into &#8220;Subscribers&#8221; of his Facebook profile.

The previous official Facebook page of Zuckerberg wasÂ ***<a href="http://facebook.com/markzuckerberg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://facebook.com/markzuckerberg', 'facebook.com/markzuckerberg']);" >facebook.com/markzuckerberg</a> ***which had over 5 million subscribers. This number wasÂ transferredÂ into &#8216;Subscriptions&#8217; on this Facebook account which isÂ ***<a href="http://facebook.com/zuck" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://facebook.com/zuck', 'facebook.com/zuck']);" >facebook.com/zuck</a>***

Even the old page URL is redirected to his profile page.

### What this means for Facebook Pages?

I noticed this change when I was added as subscriber to Mark Zuckerberg even though I had not subscribed to him. We might see the end of personal pages as it would be easier to share posts and images publicly from the profile.

Unfortunately at the moment this option for transforming &#8216;Likes&#8217; on a page intoÂ subscriptions is not available for mere mortals like you and me. ðŸ˜›
