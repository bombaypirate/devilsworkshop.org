Yesterday we talked about how people can stalk more using this application called <a href="http://fbknol.com/breakup-notifier-creepiest-facebook-app-ever/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/breakup-notifier-creepiest-facebook-app-ever/', 'Breakup notifier']);" >Breakup notifier</a>. Well, today Facebook blocked it !

According to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/23/breakup-notifier/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/23/breakup-notifier/', 'TechCrunch']);" >TechCrunch</a>, the developer of stalking application got an email from Facebook saying,

> *To ensure positive user experiences on Platform, we run routine automated screens that take user feedback, machine learning and various algorithms into account and remove spammy applications. For example, if an application is making an inordinate number of stream.publish calls and receiving a large number of user reports, it may be removed by our automated systems to protect the user experience and the Platform ecosystem.*

Breakup Notifier creator Dan Loewenherz, has contacted Facebook saying he is ready to do anything but he wants to keep running this application. If you go to the <a href="http://www.breakupnotifier.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.breakupnotifier.com/', 'Breakup Notifier website now']);" >Breakup Notifier website now</a>, you will see a message saying

> Facebook has blocked Breakup Notifier. We&#8217;re trying to bring it back online. Please contact <a href="http://twitter.com/facebook" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/facebook', 'Facebook on Twitter']);" >Facebook on Twitter</a> to express your displeasure!

Well, I guess Facebook took a right step here! It is good that the app got blocked by Facebook ! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But, well lets see what happens.
