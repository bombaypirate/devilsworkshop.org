I browse a lot daily and come across interesting pieces of content. So, if I want to save it, all I can do is, bookmark the page. But that is not a good way to do this, as I want to save a piece of content, not the whole page.

[<img class="wp-image-50681" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border-style: initial;border-color: initial;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/Image-011_thumb.png" alt="clipboard-tweet" width="635" height="313" border="0" />][1]

Clipboard is a new service which lets you save the part of webpage you want. Apart from that you can also organize your clippings (pieces of content), share it to your friends and discover new content by following them.

They provide a nifty bookmarklet which you can use to clip any part of a webpage, extensions coming soon! One major thing which separates Clipboard from other bookmarking services is that, it preserves the HTML and CSS of the clip, so it doesn’t look like an image.

Clips are private by default, but you can publish them so that your friends can see what you’re saving. You can search for content/friends and follow them in the feeds tab. You can even embed clips in your website/blog from the share menu.
