This is quite useful when you want to have a cleaner desktop while working.

For example shortcuts to all games could be on one desktop layout while all browser shortcuts on another.

I came across this software, which allows users to create and switch between multiple Desktops. Also users can customize the desktops with different wallpapers and icons.

  * Install the software and start customizing new desktops. The software allows creating up to 4 desktops.
  * I found that I could customize the wallpaper, apps, shortcuts and background colour.
  * Navigating from one desktop to another can be done with keyboard shortcuts. Even these HotKeys can be customized further.
  * When the desktop space is changed, it behaves like a completely new desktop. Even the browsers have to be synced again.

So if you are looking for cleaner and more organized desktop, ***nSpaces*** will be a good idea to create multiple desktops.

Do drop in your comments.
