I’ve been using Google Reader since a long time, from the day I started blogging. But lately I’ve searching for some alternatives and Feedly was a perfect match for me. I know it’s definitely hard to switch from a service after using for years, but ***<a href="http://feedly.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://feedly.com', 'Feedly']);" >Feedly</a>*** is worth a try.

## #1. Interface

When it comes to interface, Google Reader is still orthodox, leave themes aside, but the basic interface is ugly. For feed readers, interface matters, because I spend a lot of time in it.

Feedly with its magazine style layout, supports themes, with around 20 skins available. The navigation is clutter free, unlike Google Reader. There’s a lot of empty space to breathe and overall it’s very clean and fluid.

## #2. Reading Experience

In Feedly, you can choose the layout of the posts – magazine, timeline, tiles etc. Forget about Instapaper, Read It Later and all, you can save stories for reading later in Feedly. If you want to visit a blog without leaving the article you’re reading, you can do that by using the ‘preview article’ button.

You can also discover new content using ‘Feedly Essentials’. To get most out of Feedly, it’s good to install Feedly Mini – A browser addon which lets you add any site to your Feedly and share the page you’re reading.

## #3. Social Reading

If you use Google Reader ‘shared items’ feature, then you’ll love to use the same feature on Feedly too. Apart from that, you can connect your Facebook and Twitter accounts to Feedly which grabs and shows tweets and links shared by your friends. You can tweet right from your Feedly.

Every post will have an array of social sharing buttons.

## #4. Read Everywhere

[<img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/10/013-all-feedly-android_thumb.jpg" alt="013-all-feedly-android" width="488" height="327" border="0" />][3]

The best part of Feedly is that, it’s available on all the major Operating Systems including iOS & Android along with supporting browsers like Chrome & Firefox.

## #5. Google Reader is dormant, Feedly isn’t

After launch of Google+, almost all the Google services like Docs, Translate, Gmail etc. have got a new interface but Google Reader isn’t among them. Google Reader&#8217;s look and feel can hardly be customized, though there are [3rd party services like Reader Plus][4].

Feedly is different, they constantly push updates and release new version of apps.

## Feedly Demo

Apart from all these points, the fact that it perfectly syncs with your Google Reader should compel you to make the switch.

If you are interested in a better designed reader which works and syncs on any mobile platform, try out ***Feedly*** and drop in your comments.
