Here are the 10 most popular posts in the past week. We have calculated the popularity of the post by giving them rating points. As the posts are only a week old, we decided not to take into account &#8220;page views&#8221; which can fluctuate but take into account popularity across social networks.

It was surprising to the post on Steve Jobs Quitting Apple as CEO was not the most popular. Also Google+ related post seem to be also getting a lot of love when it came to sharing socially.

### How the Points are Calculated:

We think Facebook Shares lead the way when it comes to actually getting a good idea of which post is really popular. So FB Share is taken as the mean comparative for the rating.

<table width="497" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="273">
      FB Share
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="219">
      1 X 1.0
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="302">
      Retweet
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="229">
      1 X 0.9
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="310">
      Google’s +1
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="232">
