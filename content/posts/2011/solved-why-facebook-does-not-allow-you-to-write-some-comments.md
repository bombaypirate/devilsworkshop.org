Yesterday I mentioned about a bug on Facebook that didn&#8217;t allow me to post a comment <a href="http://fbknol.com/bugfacebook-not-allowing-to-post-comments-on-photo/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/bugfacebook-not-allowing-to-post-comments-on-photo/', '(source)']);" >(source)</a>. I found the reason behind it.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/solved-why-facebook-does-not-allow-you-to-write-some-comments/facebook-13/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/solved-why-facebook-does-not-allow-you-to-write-some-comments/facebook-13/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-4997"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4997" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/facebook.png" alt="" width="256" height="256" /></a>

In my message I was typing &#8216;OMG&#8217; in the start. The problem with that statement was that it was starting with a word like OMG. You must be aware of the <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-identify-a-spam-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-identify-a-spam-on-facebook/', 'spams']);" >spams</a> that had become viral in the past one or two months. The Â statement of the spam was

> OMG OMG now you see who viewed your profile.

Many people reported that spam, and the sentence. So what Facebook did is block all statements starting with OMG. I tweaked a bit and saw in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=12153" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=12153', 'Facebook&#8217;s Help center']);" >Facebook&#8217;s Help center</a> that a certain number of people have marked those words as spam, hence I was blocked by sending those.

The point here is that why block all the messages with OMG. What do you think? Share your views with me through comments below.
