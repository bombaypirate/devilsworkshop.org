Whatever the British royal family does, usually ends up making news. So a wedding of a prince will surely a big deal. The media all over are really gearing up for covering each and every aspect of the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

The online world has not been left behind and there is a dedicated YouTube channel for the coverage of the wedding.

Just visit the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/theroyalchannel" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/theroyalchannel', 'Royal Channel on YouTube']);" target="_blank">Royal Channel on YouTube</a> and we get to an interactive page. This page has a countdown timer for the broadcast along with options to view the map for the procession via Google map.

The broadcast will be a <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/youtube-enters-live-exclusive-era/" target="_blank">YouTube Live event</a> with starts at 29th April, 2011 at 10.00 AM GMT.

The wedding falls on a Friday, and that means a long weekend on the UK. This will probably mean a lot of people might choose to actually follow the wedding and YouTube might get a lot of them.
