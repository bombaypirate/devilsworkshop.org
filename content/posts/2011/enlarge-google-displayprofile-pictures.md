This post will tell you how you can enlarge a profile picture or display picture or simply dp of any profile on Google+.The best part of this hack is that you don&#8217;t have to use any software or script. Also the picture doesn&#8217;t loses its quality (depending upon the original size of the image) after increasing size of it. Just follow the steps below:

1. Open any profile on Google+. Right Click on the display picture and click view image. After that it will open a page with that picture only but a smaller one.

2. From the same page check out the link address given in the address bar, it will be something like:

*https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-udHdd5OLdBQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPs/W2xDoNwfe5Q/photo.jpg?sz=200*

Which shows the image:

3. Now all you have to do is change the above link a little. See the last value in the link i.e &#8220;200&#8221;. This is the size of image in pixels, change it to somewhere between 500 and 1000. After that hit enter and it will show a larger picture. If the larger picture is not clear than it means that original picture isn&#8217;t that much large. In that case change the size accordingly.

New Link:

*https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-udHdd5OLdBQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPs/W2xDoNwfe5Q/photo.jpg?sz=600*

New and larger image:

That&#8217;s it. Save the new link to save the image in a higher resolution. It&#8217;s a simple and useful hack. Don&#8217;t forget to give it a try.
