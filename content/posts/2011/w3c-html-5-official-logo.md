When it comes to web development HTML 5 is the newest buzz word. It is also looking like something that will kill Flash over the years. World Wide Web consortium (W3C ) today unveiled a new logo for HTML 5.

The logo seems to portray solidity and trust with its colors and format.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-36415" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/w3c-html-5-official-logo/html5_logo/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36415" title="HTML5_logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/HTML5_logo.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

The HTML 5 phenomenon has really caught the imagination of developers all over the world mainly because of its most ardent supporter. That supporter is called Google and Google is betting big on HTML 5.

This logo being displayed by websites and developer community in general will help HTML 5 become a standard that is quickly recognized.
