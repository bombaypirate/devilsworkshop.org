Advantage is obviously the timings and location. You do not really need an office or a desk. You can work from anywhere as long as you can access the internet.

That said, there are issues that crop up while working on different computers. One issue I always come across when using a different computer is image resizing. This means, I might have to install a new software on the computer and that is not feasible in an interne cafe or on a friend&#8217;s computer.

**ResizR** helps with resizing images on the fly, with free online tool.

  * ResizR allows users to upload their images online or use an image from the web.
  * This image can then be resized by controlling the image width. This resizes the image which then can be downloaded or shared from the image URL.
  * Apart from resizing, it also allows the images to be rotated.
  * The best part is the online tool does not need users to register or create accounts.

I can use a different computer, not download any software and still manage to resize and rotate images. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Do try out ResizR and drop in your comments.
