Now a days, it is quite easy to view PDF files within most updated browser. But that is not all there is to viewing a PDF â€“ I like to use mark-up or comment on it, even extract images and text from a PDF file. For this I found PDF Nitro Reader very helpful.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="PDF_Nitro_Reader" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/09/PDF_Nitro_Reader_thumb.png" alt="PDF_Nitro_Reader" width="570" height="374" border="0" />][1]

  * Most times it is quite suitable to view PDF documents on a browser; but invariably PDFs are not just web articles and we need more options like highlighting important text or paragraphs along with inserting sticky notes.
  * Nitro PDF Reader allows editing the PDF document, along with the ability to extract images and text.
  * It also supports QuickSign for adding digital signatures on PDF documents.
  * The software is also compatible with most browsers.

Try out PDF Nitro Reader and drop in your comments.
