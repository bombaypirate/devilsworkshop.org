Yes, did you imagine what Facebook can do? Have a look at the image below. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

As we all know<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent', ' Clark Kent']);" > Clark Kent</a> was the real name behind Superman. In the image above we can see what superman is afraid of. His profile was named with his real name, and he too had a Facebook account. Guess what he got busted. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

People got to know his real name and hence the postings and fake photos and everything. Hah! It may seem funny, but if we see it in today&#8217;s world, this is real. People are having fake profiles, being hacked on Facebook, serious bad messages and all are very common these days. When someone who is quite famous makes a profile, he is afraid of being stalked by many.

What do you think people should do? Do share your thoughts with me. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
