Great news for Facebook addicts! Seven airlines will be running a promotion with Gogo internet to give you free Facebook access. Out of which Delta Airlines offers more daily flights withÂ <a href="http://www.gogoinflight.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gogoinflight.com/', 'Gogo Inflight Internet']);" rel="nofollow">Gogo Inflight Internet</a> service than any other airline.

The airlines include Delta, AirTran, American, Virgin Atlantic, Alaska, US Airways, and United, who with Gogo will now offer internet on 1,100 commercial and 5,000 private planes. Wow! I am not sure how long will this offer last, but wonder when will India be getting such facility. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

People in a flight always wish if they could surf internet , have free WiFi facility and a lot more. Well , at least one thing can be fulfilled now. What do you think about this ? A great way to ask people to travel in your flight and do Facebook. ðŸ˜‰ Right! Share your views with me.
