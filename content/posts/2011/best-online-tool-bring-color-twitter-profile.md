There are many posts and web services out there, about how to design Twitter backgrounds. I am not really impressed with some of the ready-made designs. I for one think most of them are boring with little scope for customization. **<a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/themeleon/twitter" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.colourlovers.com/themeleon/twitter', 'Colourlovers']);" >Colourlovers</a> **website has a nice online tool which really helped me bring a lot of color to my Twitter profile. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  * There are quite a few themes to select from. That is not all, once a theme is selected, we can go ahead and customize it.
  * We can customize palettes color by color or select some of the ready-made ones to go with the theme you have selected.
  * The best part was as we made changes a preview can be seen below the design area.

If you are someone who likes to have colorful Twitter profile backgrounds but do not want to waste too much time over it, **Colourlovers Themeleon **for Twitter seems to be perfect. Do give it a try and let me know your views through comments.
