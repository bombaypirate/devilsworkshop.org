Some two months ago I posted about how Facebook has taken over MySpace (<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-has-a-total-win-over-myspace/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-has-a-total-win-over-myspace/', 'Source']);" >Source</a>) . Well, now I can&#8217;t help smiling myself, when I found out this. Even MySpace has a Facebook Page. ðŸ˜€

When I saw this page it had to be shared with you all. We present you statistics, graphs and what not, but what more can we actually share? This is it ! MySpace created a page for marketing themselves on Facebook.

I know its okay to create a page and all, but will you by any chance include your biggest competitor ? Hah ! That too you are making a page on Facebook for MySpace. I wonder what Mark Zuckerberg would have felt on seeing this ? May be MySpace people just wanted to market and they found Facebook with greatest number of Â social network lovers.

What do you think ? Share your views with me. Did you like this step or you too find it quite funny . ðŸ˜›
