It does not have a lot of features except sharing links, posts, images and nice Hangout feature. Last night, Google has started rolling out games on their new social network offering.

The new Games option will show up above the Streams. Click on it will take users to a different ‘Games’ page which will allow users to play online.

## Google+ Games Features

The ‘Games’ feature will rest as a separate page and hence all the updates should be relegated to that page. I guess this is different from games on Facebook which end up updating achievements on the ‘wall’ and can upset a lot of friends who are not at all interested in playing these games.

The new games on offer will obviously impact Facebook or at least throws a direct challenge to them. One of the main reasons why people spend a lot of time on Facebook are games like Farmville and Mafia which had active followers in their millions.

[Angry Birds already has a Chrome app][3] and now seems to be closer to Google by making an appearance on Google+. It might also give some of these games the social element which was missing previously.

The feature on Google+ will be rolled out soon, if you have it available do drop in your views about Google+ Games.
