Yet another scam, telling you how many hours did you stay on Facebook in 2010.

When I saw my friend&#8217;s status on my wall, I understood that again is one of the scams on Facebook. I wonder how do they get started and why don&#8217;t people avoid clicking them.

Anyways, if you click on the link provided, you are taken to another page, giving you lots of options to choose from. They are either download something or just complete some IQ test, to prove that you are human. Hah! Even if you don&#8217;t click on anything, this post gets published on the wall making a pit for others to fall in.

Just ignore such posts or even if you have clicked any, delete the post and save others from it! Share your views on this with me.
