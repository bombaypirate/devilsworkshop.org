Google has introduced the [option of reverse search for similar images][1] by allowing users to upload a photo or even paste a link of the image. Google probably uses the same technology that is used for face recognition, to scan across the web and come up with matches.  
Google Image search by drawing allows users to draw a sketch and search for it on Google Images.

  * Just use the mouse to quickly sketch something. Users can change the colours or even the size of the brush to make more intricate drawings.
  * Users can also take a photo from their webcam and search for that image on Google images. This might be useful to search for a comic from a newspaper.
  * The online tool is developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/enzenhofer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/#!/enzenhofer', 'Franz Enzenhofer']);" >Franz Enzenhofer</a>. The online tool does work on Chrome, Safari and Firefox but it is not supported on Internet Explorer.
