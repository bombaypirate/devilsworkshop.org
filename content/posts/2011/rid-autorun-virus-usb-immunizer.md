Autorun.inf, the very well known virus carrier can now be immunized using Bitdefenderâ€™s USB Immunizer. This Autorun technology (introduced by Microsoft) has grabbed lots of hatred from security experts. Autorun.inf is a configuration file which knows what actions to perform when a new removable device is attached, but this is used by malware for spreading virus on to other computers (when the same USB is plugged into another computer).

## BitDefender USB Immunizer

  * Using Bitdefenderâ€™s USB Immunizer you can immunize your computer and USB, thus no more virus spread. USB Immunizer actually disables the Autorun feature and deactivates the Autorun.inf file thus the malware canâ€™t modify it.
  * The only disadvantage I found is you canâ€™t activate Autorun once you deactivate using USB Immunizer, so think twice before you take action. ðŸ˜€

### Alternatives

  * One of the best alternatives to USB Immunizer is Panda Research USB Vaccine. Even it does the same i.e. disabling Autorun but I would prefer USB Immunizer to USB Vaccine as USB Vaccine needs installation while USB Immunizer is a portable app (doesn&#8217;t need installation).
  * There may be more alternatives but think twice before downloading any such apps because there are many fake apps which promise to immunize Autorun.inf file but do the reverse (checkout <a href="http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/rogues/latest" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/rogues/latest', 'Lavasoftâ€™s rogue apps']);" >Lavasoftâ€™s rogue apps</a> page).

Another interesting thing I found is, even though I immunized my computer using USB Immunizer, USB Vaccine still shows my computer is not immunized, strange!

Do drop in your comments.
