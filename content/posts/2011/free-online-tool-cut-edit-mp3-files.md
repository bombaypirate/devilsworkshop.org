Today, everyone has hundreds of MP3 files if not thousands. We tend to listen to music more on our computers and phones than anywhere else. I have a lot of instrumental music and many times I do not like the entire track and only a part of it.

<a href="http://cutmp3.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cutmp3.net/', 'Cutmp3']);" >Cutmp3</a> is a website that allows you to cut and edit mp3 files online and free.

  * Just upload the MP3 files on the website and start playing the track.
  * The track can then be edited by managing the play-time of the track. Select the start and finish time of the track.
  * Click on the “Cut” button and it prompts you to download the edited track.

Do try out CutMp3 online tool to edit your mp3 tracks and drop in your comments.
