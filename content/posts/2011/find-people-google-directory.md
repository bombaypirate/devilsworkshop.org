When it comes to success of a new social network, it depends to a large extent on how excited are third-party developers are about the new service. I have already written about [Google+ profile URL shortener][1] and today I came across a directory for Google+ users.

<a href="http://www.findpeopleonplus.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.findpeopleonplus.com/', 'Find People on Plus']);" >Find People on Plus</a> is a directory of Google Plus users. It indexes profiles and shows data like how many people are following that particular profile along with how many people that person follows.

It is ironic, that the most followed person on Google+ at the moment is Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="findpeopleonpplus_googlePLus_directory." src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/07/findpeopleonpplus_googlePLus_directory._thumb.png" alt="findpeopleonpplus_googlePLus_directory." width="570" height="351" border="0" />][2]

The directory also allows looking up people by location, gender, interests and other details. It also has some nice stats like what occupation is the most popular on Google+.

Also which city has the most Google+ profiles. At the time of writing this post, it had indexed just shy of a million profiles. Other than finding new people, I find it more useful to look up Google+ usage stats and trends.

Do try out FInd People on Plus and drop in your comments.
