After posting about different PC-based multi-protocol messenger, its time to turn to web-based multi-protocol messenger. Unfortunately at the time of writing this post i don&#8217;t hv many to review.  
I know only one of its kind &#8211; <a href="http://www.meebo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meebo.com/', 'meebo']);" >meebo</a> & don&#8217;t feel we&#8217;ll ever need to find another.<a href="http://www.meebo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meebo.com/', 'Meebo']);" >Meebo</a> is a web based IM that lets you log into your IM networks (e.g. GoogleTalk, Yahoo!, MSN, AIM, ICQ, Jabber) from any computer with a browser and internet connection with no firewall issues. It employs technologies (like AJAX) to make it act more like a desktop application, which dramatically improves usability. Many users enjoy the benefits of a native DHTML application, as it does not consume as many system resources as a Java applet (such as ICQ2Go or Yahoo Web Messenger).Moreover u can create a <a href="http://www.meebo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meebo.com/', 'meebo']);" >meebo</a> ID, so just type ur user-ID & password once n log into all ur fav messenger.

For publishers, there is a thing called <a href="http://www.meebome.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meebome.com/', 'WIDGET']);" >WIDGET</a> that u can directly paste on to ur site code so u can talk to ur site visitors directly!!! U can see live example of this just check-out my sites lower-right corner!

So wat r u waiting for. just <a href="http://www.meebo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meebo.com/', '']);" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-51240" alt="meebo" src="http://www.gomeebo.com/buttons/gomeebo-3.gif" border="0" /></a>

As meebo is web-based it is 100% platform independent!!! At the time of writing this, it does not support following browsers:  
IE 7.0 Beta & Beta 2 and Opera 8.53
