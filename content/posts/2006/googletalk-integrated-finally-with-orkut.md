3 days back I wrote about <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/11/05/orkut-googletalk-unlimited-social-networking/" target="_blank">Orkut & GoogleTalk Integration!</a>

What is the coolest thing is that the way they have done this integration! Many people had different opinion about this integration But as I wrote about adding a green dot indicator beside every profile who is online & using GoogleTalk simultaneously!

[<img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px;cursor: pointer;width: 386px;height: 237px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/blogger/blogger2/2759/3022/400/orkut%20launched%20gtalk.jpg" border="0" alt="" />][1]

<span style="font-weight: bold">So wats new on orkut now?</span>  
When u log into orkut, u will see green dot beside some of the profiles! This means they r using GoogleTalk or any other IM network but signed into GoogleTalk service like Gmail!

Now when u click on any such green dot for the first time, u&#8217;ll get redirected to the page where u can choose your privacy n one step further your orkut account will be linked to GoogleTalk!

Don&#8217;t have GoogleTalk! [Download & install it from here][2]!  
GoogleTalk is available only for Windows Platform as of now!  
But u can use this service from other IM networks!

Listing here are links so that u can use this feature!

  * <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/08/04/review-multi-protocol-messengers-pc-based/" target="_blank">From Linux, Mac & other OS i.e from PC!</a>
  * <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/08/04/review-meebo-web-based-im-client/" target="_blank">From Internet only using web based messenger!</a>
  * <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/08/06/review-im-mobile-instant-messenger/" target="_blank">From ur cell phone using cell-based messenger!</a>

What&#8217;s more you can disable GoogleTalk Integration anytime you want by going to orkut&#8217;s GoogleTalk Settings!  
So next time don&#8217;t ask someone whether he/she use any messenger service!
