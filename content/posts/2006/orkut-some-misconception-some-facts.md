Dear friends,

I would just like to inform u people about some common misconceptions&#8230;

<span style="font-weight: bold">Misconception #1: ORKUT IS DELETING PROFILES</span> 

  * Orkut is NOT deleting profiles!
  * Orkut is run by google which is having a 300% growth in terms of revenue for this fiscal year!
  * They can handle any abysmal requirement of processing power or space!
  * They are NOT experiencing any information processing or storage problems as yet!

<span style="font-weight: bold">Misconception #2: YOU CAN GET PAID BY FORWARDING AN E-MAIL</span> 

  * Until Today, Sunday, 21st Sept 2006, there is no way to keep track of where a mail gets forwarded!
  * Microsoft will not know if I send a mail from google server to my friend (EVEN IF IT IS A FORWARDED MAIL) unless you explicitly execute some code or click some link!
  * However may I wish, I have no means to know whether my friend is forwarding the mail I sent to him or not. Nor does Microsoft, Google or any other corp. or inc.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Misconception #3: WOMAN TAKING A ROHYPNOL PILL WILL NEVER CONCEIVE</span> 

  * Are all men and women undergoing a surgery for family planning DUMB?
  * Woman cannot be made incapable of conceiving by dropping a pill in her drink.
  * Rohypnol is used as a sedative and pre-anesthetic.
  * It is called &#8220;Rape Date Drug&#8221; because it is extremely potent, especially with alcohol.
  * It initially makes a person dizzy and disoriented and with time makes it difficult to speak or move before the person passes out.
  * Due to this effect, this drug is used by rapists to incapacitate their victims.
  * Such victims have no memories of what happened WHILE UNDER the drug&#8217;s influence. (They can perfectly remember what they were doing before getting sedated)
  * It is illegal (in the U.S but not in Europe and Canada)

<span style="font-weight: bold">No comments about emotional messages appealing a person to forward a mail because it will either&#8230;</span> 

  * suddenly make his love of life realize that she should call him/she should meet him/She should fall in love with him!
  * or increase life expectancy of himself or his father/mother/brother/sister/any other relatives!
  * or make something &#8220;GOOD&#8221;(?) happen in his life!
  * or earn him an unexpected fortune!
  * or because some poor/crippled/terminally infected/just infected/dying person will get money for every mail you forward!<span style="font-weight: bold">(I do not mean to disrespect the intentions but it is pointless as your forwards cannot be tracked)</span>
  * or just because it is part of a world record attempt!
  * or because this e-mail is part of &#8220;chain&#8221; that many people have kept or going for no particular reason so you should also do the same!

<div style="direction: ltr">
  <span style="font-weight: bold">AND THAT STUPID CRUSH THING DOES NOT POP UP IF YOU FORWARD THAT LOONEY MAIL&#8230;&#8230;..</span> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      the only way of knowing your crush is if both the people add each other to their own crush list.
    </li>
    <li>
      there is NO WAY of knowing anyone else&#8217;s crush&#8217;s or your own, if none of the above happens.
    </li>
  </ul>
