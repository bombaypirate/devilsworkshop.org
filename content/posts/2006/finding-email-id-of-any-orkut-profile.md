* * *This is trick to get email address of any profile on orkut!As you may be knowing already that you can go to &#8220;friends&#8221; page in your orkut account and see all your friends primary email addresses! This seems applicable to only friend who has already joined your friends network! But wait, you can see the email id of any profile on orkut, even if the concern person chooses to hide his/her email address!</p> 

Here are steps&#8230;

  1. Just add the target person as a friend (by going to his profile).
  2. Don&#8217;t wait for the approval. Go to your <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;friends&#8221;</span> page immediately.
  3. Click on <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;Open friend requests&#8221; </span>on the top-left corner.
  4. Find the name of the person whom you just added.
  5. Click on <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;EDIT&#8221;</span> at the right side of that person&#8217;s profile.
  6. You can see his/her email id there!!
