Gwigle is an online puzzle game that actually teaches you Google search tricks as you play. Each screen shows a few search results along with the search string at the top. One word is replaced with question marks; it&#8217;s your job to fill it in. It&#8217;s hands-on education that feels more like you&#8217;re playing a game than learning useful knowledge.

Glancing at the search results gives you clues as to what the mystery search term is. If you&#8217;re stuck, you can always hit up Google for some clues. Simply copy some of the text from Gwigle and search away.

Some of the puzzles are a little tricky and it can be difficult to find the answers, even with thorough Google research. Most of them are fairly easy, however, and won&#8217;t take you too long to complete. You can always bookmark the puzzle you&#8217;re on and come back to it later.

Gwigle is a great puzzle game for anyone, not just power Googlers-to-be. Give it a try and see if you accidentally learn something useful. U can always mail Wang as he answered to my queries fast beyond my imagination!

The game contains 16 + 7 levels (at least when I played)!
