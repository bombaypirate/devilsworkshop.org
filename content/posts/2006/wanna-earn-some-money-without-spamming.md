Now-a-days I am getting lots of spam with title saying some stupid way to earn money. Observing intensity of this spam I felt like going into depth to discover real opportunities!

I did not find many but till then would like to share with you the ways through which I am earning money online. Of course these are not for the people for who wants to be millionaire overnight and also not for the people who thinks or wants to earn just clicking few links and sending spam mails.

<span style="font-weight: bold">I wonder how people think they can earn either without efforts or crime!</span>

Currently I am earning through <a href="http://www.adsense.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adsense.com/', 'Google Adsense']);" >Google Adsense</a> and <a href="http://www.shareapic.net/ref.php?owner=rahul286" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shareapic.net/ref.php?owner=rahul286', 'shareapic']);" >shareapic</a>! I am also testing few more ways which I will share with you after confirming they are not spams!

<span style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 130%">1. </span><span style="font-size: 130%"><a href="http://www.adsense.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adsense.com/', 'Google Adsense']);" >Google Adsense</a> (For publishers only)</span>

This is a program for publishers. A publisher is a person who is running blog, site, etc. On sign-up you get separate account. Once your account is confirmed you get three ways to earn.

  * Showing Sponsored links
  * Referring people to products.
  * Adding Google Search Capability to your site.

In all three ways you will get javascript code which you have to add on your site.  
After adding code things will be displayed when somebody visits your site. You will earn only when people click on sponsored links or download products. You don&#8217;t need to be expert of javascript for this. All you need is access to codes of your site, blog, pages, etc.

With average 200 visitors to my blog I&#8217;m earning $0.5 daily!
