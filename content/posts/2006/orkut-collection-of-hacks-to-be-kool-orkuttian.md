Listing in this post some orkut hacks, tricks which you can use to be kool orkuttian!  
<span style="font-size: 130%"><br /> <strong>ALT+0173 Tricks</strong></span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold">1.</span> Ever seen someone without First name and/or Last Name! If yes, you might have tried to do the sane but while editing your profile came 2 know that first name n last name can not be left blank! So how did others did that?

While editing name just put **ALT+0173** i.e. press **ALT** & while it is pressed type **0173** in any field u want to left blank! You wont see any output! (In Opera u may see **&#8216;-&#8216;** character but surely nothing will be displayed in Firefox n IE)

<span style="font-weight: bold">2.</span> You can also use this special character if you want to escape orkut&#8217;s default formatting which is applied to your text while posting on communities and writing scrap!

<span style="font-weight: bold">e.g. [rÃ‚Â­ed]Hi[/Ã‚Â­red] wont look </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000">Hi</span>

if u use [r<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">(ALT+0173)</span>ed]Hi[/r<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">(ALT+0173)</span>ed]!

Just insert <span style="font-weight: bold">ALT+0173 </span>anywhere!  
U can also insert in Url&#8217;s to escape image verification while posting links but they wont be clickable <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<span style="font-weight: bold">3.</span> You can just write **ALT+0173** while posting on communities n scrapbook to post blank scrap n posts!

For More ALT+0173 Tricks n demos <a href="http://www.orkut.com/CommMsgs.aspx?cmm=19587001&tid=2491881424635910708" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/CommMsgs.aspx?cmm=19587001&tid=2491881424635910708', 'click here!']);" >click here!</a>

<span style="font-size: 130%"><strong><br /> Hompage Field&#8230;</strong></span>

The best link to setup as your homepage is <a href="https://www.orkut.com/GLogin.aspx?cmd=logout" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.orkut.com/GLogin.aspx?cmd=logout', 'https://www.orkut.com/GLogin.aspx?cmd=logout']);" >https://www.orkut.com/GLogin.aspx?cmd=logout</a>  
When someone click on this the person will be logged out from his/her orkut session ðŸ˜€

This made many people fool (including me) as we often don&#8217;t read actual content of homepage field while checking someone&#8217;s profile!

**  
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 130%">Do u think logging into Orkut is slow n login box disappears???</span>**

Bookmark the following link and use it to login into orkut!

<a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLoginBox?service=orkut&nui=2&uilel=1&skipvpage=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orkut.com%2FRedirLogin.aspx%3Fmsg%3D0%26page%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.orkut.com%252F&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orkut.com%2FGLogin.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLoginBox?service=orkut&nui=2&uilel=1&skipvpage=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orkut.com%2FRedirLogin.aspx%3Fmsg%3D0%26page%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.orkut.com%252F&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orkut.com%2FGLogin.aspx', 'https://www.google.com/&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;www.orkut.com%2FGLogin.aspx']);" >https://www.google.com/&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;www.orkut.com%2FGLogin.aspx</a>

The above link directly opens orkut login box! So it is faster than normal orkut login!
