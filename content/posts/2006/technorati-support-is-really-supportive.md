To all bloggers from all domain, if you have not heard about <a href="http://technorati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://technorati.com/', 'technorati']);" >technorati</a>, then I can only say that you are quite unfortunate!

<a href="http://technorati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://technorati.com/', 'Technorati']);" >Technorati</a> is dedicated site which have database about <span style="font-weight: bold">54.7 million</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">blogs</span>. When I visited this site for the first time I already found my blog there. But there was a problem as my blog was not properly indexed and the information was quite old!

I have done everything from adding <a href="http://technorati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://technorati.com/', 'technorati']);" >technorati</a> tags to my blog post to validating my blogs HTML and after all went in vain I decided to finally contact technorati support to help me out!  
As I was expecting I got a automated reply to my email and I thought this is another giant who does not have time for his customers lovers!  
But within15 days I got reply to this with everything in proper place!

I am quite active in contacting support section of various services but for the first time I got real reply. So all I can say to my blogger friends, if you love technorati then don&#8217;t hesitate while contacting them. Sooner or later, they will come to you!

Appending here first reply from them! (Actually they have answered my all queries <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
