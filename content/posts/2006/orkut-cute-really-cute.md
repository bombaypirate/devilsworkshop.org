Hey pals,  
After flooding the next thing you are wishing is obviously a way to send a single scrap to all your friends&#8230; a very uncool way to forward something as of now (for you) is sending your scrap as a message&#8230; I find this is very boring.. <span style="color: #ff0000"><em><br /> </em></span>  
So should we ask dear orkut to provide this feature??? I can&#8217;t wait so long so I discovered Orkut Cute and this is by <a href="http://www.apcsoftware.com.br/ingles" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apcsoftware.com.br/ingles', 'APC softwares']);" target="_blank">APC softwares</a>!

Orkut cute is packed with features and you will come to know when you will download and use it! To give an idea listing here some features i really like&#8230;<span style="color: #ff0000"><br /> </span>

  * U can send one single scrap to all your friends.
  * It also informs u when u receive new scraps from your pals n new topics in yours communities.
  * U can delete multiple scraps at once.
  * <span style="font-weight: bold">U can send one single scrap to all your community members!</span>
  * You can create several standard messages: they are stored in a database, so that you don&#8217;t need to type them all over again.
  * You can choose to which friends you want to send your message
  * Macro replacement unique system. By placing the identifiers **$nc$** or **$nl$** anywhere on your message, they will be replaced by your friend&#8217;s name once the message is posted
  * By activating the ***random messages¬ù*** option the program will search messages randomly on its database everytime it posts. This way you will be able to create several messages and each of your friends will receive a different message.
