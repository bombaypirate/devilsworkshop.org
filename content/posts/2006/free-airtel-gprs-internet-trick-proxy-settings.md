In NUTSHELL you have to do only 3 things

  1. Enter your cel no. into USER NAME/NO. Field (If it is blank)
  2. Change access point / APN to airtelfun.com or airtelmms.com
  3. Configuring your application for following proxy setting&#8230;

If u r using <span style="font-weight: bold;">airtelfun.com</span> IP Addr : <span style="font-weight: bold;">100.1.200.99</span> Port no. <span style="font-weight: bold;">8080</span>

If u r using <span style="font-weight: bold;">airtelmms.com</span> IP Addr : <span style="font-weight: bold;">100.1.201.172</span> Port No. <span style="font-weight: bold;">8799</span>

That all about settings!
