Approximately a month ago, <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/10/introducing-orkut-events-set-up-and-invite-friends-on-your-birthday-bash-on-orkut.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/10/introducing-orkut-events-set-up-and-invite-friends-on-your-birthday-bash-on-orkut.html', 'Gaurav Dua']);" >Gaurav Dua</a> mentioned on his blog that:  
Orkut is going to introduce few more features in the coming days including &#8216;event&#8217; feature, and it is so. Last afternoon when I logged into my Orkut profile I saw this option in my profile as well. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  Well, I guess by now this feature must be available in everyone&#8217;s profile (as my profile gets all new feature at last). <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But what is it all about?Â  I tried doing some research using this new feature, and I am going to say you all what I could do out of this thing..

  Though I did not find this feature much useful, still I gave it a try. Immediately after hitting the &#8216;events&#8217; button on the left sidebar of my homepage, I got a form to fill and I did so by entering one of my friend&#8217;s birth day and also invited some of my friends too, to attend the event. Guess all the invitees have got an invitation and have an option either to accept, reject or choose the option &#8216;may be attending&#8217; for the invitation sent to them.

  Well many things done and said, but it matter not how much features Orkut introduces, but what matters is how useful are those feature..? You too give it a try and let us know, personally how useful did you find this feature.

Thanks [Arjun][1] for your tip <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
