* * *TeaShark, a mobile browser like Opera Mini, allow you to access Airtel GPRS for FREE. Shockingly it has nothing to do with modifying any Airtel settings or any kind of hack. I am clueless about how its working! I tested it personally throughout the week but I haven&#8217;t been charged a single penny.</p> 

**Here is how I used this&#8230;**

  * <a href="http://teashark.com/download.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://teashark.com/download.html', 'Download TeaShark v. 312']);" >Download TeaShark v. 312</a>. Its free and being JAR file it can be installed on most handsets.
  * Open it from your mobile and select **AirTel Live** as access point.
  * That&#8217;s it! Open any site from TeaShark and you won&#8217;t be charged anything.

Note for the first time, when TeaShark starts, it may take more than one minute to initialize. Also this one time initialization may fail many times. But don&#8217;t loose your heart! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**Here are some famous sites&#8217; ****mobile version****..**.

  * Gmail: <a href="http://m.gmail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.gmail.com', 'm.gmail.com']);" >m.gmail.com</a>
  * Orkut: <a href="http://m.orkut.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.orkut.com', 'm.orkut.com']);" >m.orkut.com</a>
  * Facebook: <a href="http://m.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.facebook.com', 'm.facebook.com']);" >m.facebook.com</a>
  * Twitter: <a href="http://m.twitter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.twitter.com', 'm.twitter.com']);" >m.twitter.com</a>

As a first post at Devils Workshop, I wrote about [free Airtel GPRS][1] two years ago. This is much different that earlier trick. As of now, this trick is limited to handsets only. The earlier one used to work even from PC.

The whole thing seems a fortunate coincidence for mobile users and unfortunate one for network operators. This trick cannot be termed illegal as you are not cracking any software or modifying any configuration. For the same reason, I think this will take longer to get rectified.

Please keep in mind that AirTel may charge you all of a sudden in future of this free ride. So please [use it at your own risk][2]! üòâ

## FAQ: * *

**Q. Error: ‚ÄúSubscribe to Packet Data First‚Äù**

**Ans:** This means you need to activate **AirTel Live** service which is free. Contact customer care to get it activated. Also select only **AirTel Live** as access point when prompted by TeaShark.

**Q. TeaShark stuck at blank screen.  
**

**Ans:** New version of TeaShark has some problems. Please download one using link given below.

**Q. Will this work on my mobile?  
**

**Ans:** Most probably YES, as this is java java applications and most good handsets supports java applications.

**Q. Its not working&#8230;**

**Ans:** Sorry. We can&#8217;t do anything then for you. I have personally seen this hack working in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi while it didn&#8217;t work for me in Rajasthan.

**Download Link:** <a href="http://teashark.com/download.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://teashark.com/download.html', 'Download TeaShark v. 312']);" >Download TeaShark v. 312</a>
