From last few days, I was seeing Google Adsense ads on Orkut users homepage. 

Following screenshot highlights ad in lower-right corner which is taken from my friend <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=7693437949979794680" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=7693437949979794680', 'Vijay&#8217;s']);" >Vijay&#8217;s</a> account&#8230;

[<img class="wp-image-52796" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="470" alt="orkut showing google adsense ads on home" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/03/orkut-showing-google-adsense-ads-on-home-thumb.jpg" width="494" border="0" />][1] 

There are few things to note about these ads which shows Orkut is still not serious about making money out of it!

  1. First they are mix of image as well as text ads. Other Google services show only text ads. Text ads work better and took less time to load. 
  2. Its mentioned clearly that they are **"Advertisement"**. In other Google services they put **"Sponsored Links"** around ads. Sponsored Links could bring more clicks compare to Advertisement caption! 
  3. Long time back orkut started showing ads in community pages but now they moved to user homepage directly. Still scrapbook are left clean which is most accessible area of orkut as per <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/01/orkut-trends-who-sends-scraps.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/01/orkut-trends-who-sends-scraps.html', 'orkut trends']);" >orkut trends</a>. 

Looks like orkut is still experimenting with these ads, as they are not shown everytime homepage loads. In fact, I haven&#8217;t seen any ad on my orkut homepage! It may be because of [adblock plus addon][2], but a fellow blogger <a href="http://www.techpavan.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techpavan.com/', 'Pavan']);" >Pavan</a> confirmed presence of ads via email around a week ago.

Personally I don&#8217;t think these ads are annoying at all. ***What do you think?***
