Few months back Orkut added a facebook like friends finder. Using that friend finder you could find & invite all your Gmail friends on orkut without much work. We and many other at that time wished orkut should have done that facebook way and made friend finder to work with any email account. Looks like orkut team listened our calls and came up with new improved friends finder.

[<img class="wp-image-54448" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;border-right-width: 0px" height="464" alt="Orkut New Friends Finder" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/orkut-new-friends-finder-thumb.jpg" width="400" border="0" />][1] 

As shown in screenshot now you can also add friends from Hotmail, Yahoo & AOL!

***"find friends"*** box can be seen in left sidebar on your orkuts home page. If you never used this feature in past then be sure to read [orkut friend finder][2] guide!

One more thing, some of my friends haven&#8217;t seen this new friend finder on their account yet. I guess like many other feature in past, orkut is rolling this slowly. So it make take a day or two for this feature to get activated on your account! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
