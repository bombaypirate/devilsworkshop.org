<img class="wp-image-53001" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px" src="http://www.indiblogger.in/badges/big_indi20.png" alt="" align="right" /> <a href="http://www.indiblogger.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.indiblogger.in/', 'IndiBlogger']);" >IndiBlogger</a> is a directory of Indian blogs and a meeting point for bloggers. Unlike many other directories of blogs, IndiBlogger directory is powered by <a href="http://www.indibloogle.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.indibloogle.in/', 'IndiBloogle']);" >IndiBloogle</a> -a nice example of Google&#8217;s custom search feature. Also, meetings feature is highly innovative as any member can call for meet on any tag! Like a photoblogger can call for a meet by selecting photoblog tag to get to know other photobloggers.

One such meet was organized last evening in Pune which I attended. Thanks to <a href="http://www.iprash.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.iprash.com/', 'Prashant']);" >Prashant</a> for reminding me about meeting otherwise I would have missed it for sure as I was busy shifting furniture to my place! So in hurry with my fellow blogger <a href="http://anilwadghule.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://anilwadghule.com/blog/', 'Anil']);" >Anil</a> I rushed to the event without much expectations as I joined indiBlogger just 2 days back.

Thanks to <a href="http://vinni.co.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vinni.co.in/', 'Vineet']);" >Vineet</a>, <a href="http://anw.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://anw.in/', 'Anwin']);" >Anwin</a>, indiBlogger Team and event sponsor Microsoft the event turned out to be much better than my expectation! This is the reason I am posting about it.. ðŸ˜‰

So few things I have noticed that were different compare to blogger meets I attended in past&#8230;

  * First there were more non-technical bloggers than typical tech blogger like me ðŸ˜‰
  * There was high concentration of regional language bloggers which is nice for the whole blogging community.
  * So many <a href="http://justamotheroftwo.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://justamotheroftwo.blogspot.com/', 'nice']);" >nice</a> <a href="http://sakshijuneja.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sakshijuneja.com/blog/', 'chicks']);" >chicks</a> in blogging&#8230; I guess blogosphere is getting glamorous ðŸ˜‰
  * Every blogger got chance to showcase their blogs in ***&#8220;1-minute of fame&#8221;*** event.
  * Although event was sponsored, there was no promotional activity than introduction to Windows Live Writer (WLW) by <a href="http://whimsicalmind.wordpress.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://whimsicalmind.wordpress.com/', 'Sandhya Rajan']);" >Sandhya Rajan</a>, a Microsoft Intern. WLW is best desktop blogging client and I was surprised to see very few bloggers knew about it. I will post about it in detail soon!

Also <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jimkarter.com/', 'Karamveer Singh']);" >Karamveer Singh</a> and his <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/2008-03-03-february-2008-earnings-55123.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jimkarter.com/2008-03-03-february-2008-earnings-55123.html', '$55123 earnings']);" >$55123 earnings</a> in February 2008 was something to remember!

On personal front I was delighted to meet and get some nice guidelines from <a href="http://www.iprash.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.iprash.com/', 'Prashant Karandikar']);" >Prashant Karandikar</a>.

**Update: **Those who missed this meet can attend [Mumbai Meet][1] scheduled on **27th April 2007**. Details are [here][1]&#8230;
