Following rival Facebook’s path, Orkut added another new feature, ***conversation***, to its continuously upgrading new features list. This is similar to **wall-to-wall** feature present on Facebook since beginning.

As usual, with Orkut’s most of new features, this will take some time to get enabled on your account. Once it is there you will be able to see a button/link in your scrapbook beside reply link already there.

When you will click on it, a popup will show all scarps exchanged between you and your friend. You can delete any scrap from pop-up. Below is screenshot provided by Deep.

I will update this post once the feature gets enabled on my account. In meantime, if you find something new about it in your account, please let us know.

Thanks Deep for the tip as well as screenshot. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
