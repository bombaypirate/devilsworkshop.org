[<img class="wp-image-51951" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="225" alt="Scrapboy supports facebook now" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/05/image-thumb6.png" width="400" border="0" />][1] 

Started as [orkut messenger][2], scrapboy improved over the time. After myspace, they now added support for facebook. 

Long <a href="http://www.scrapboy.com/en/features.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.scrapboy.com/en/features.html', 'list of supported features']);" >list of supported features</a> and appealing user interface will make scrapboy your sweetheart. Designed with keeping minor details in mind, scrapboy take care of missing feature on individual social networks. So do not think it as another desktop-way to access few online sites. 

As a simple example, have a look at facebooks&#8217; birthday reminder feature enhanced in scrapboy&#8230;

[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="440" alt=" facebooks birthday reminder feature " src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/05/image-thumb7.png" width="483" border="0" />][3] 

Still latest [facebook chat feature][4] is not available in scrapboy as it is [integrated into Digsby][5]. But on the other hand scrapboy is much more centered around social networking sites while digsby is yet to support orkut.
