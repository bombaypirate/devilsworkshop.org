[<img class="linked-to-original wp-image-53550" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/09/googlebeta1.jpg" height="66" align="right" width="200" />][1]During last few weeks, many blogs posted about Google&#8217;s 10th official anniversary. Surprisingly, Google did very little to mark an event, compared to the enthusiasm they usually show for not-so-big events.

May be its debate on Google&#8217;s actual anniversary date, or may be Google, as usual, decided to do it differently by keeping entire event low profile.

Technically Google.com was registered on September 15, 1997 *(*<a href="http://1997-09-15" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://1997-09-15']);" ><i>whois data</i></a>*)*. Many Googlers posted nice articles as part of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Google%20at%2010" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Google%20at%2010', '10th anniversary celebration']);" >10th anniversary celebration</a>. But thing I liked most, is <a href="http://www.google.com/tenthbirthday/#start" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/tenthbirthday/#start', 'interactive timeline of Google history']);" >interactive timeline of Google history</a>.

Google fan will surely love this time travel. Also for those who are lazy enough to read best book on Google history, *&#8220;<a href="http://www.thegooglestory.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thegooglestory.com/', 'The Google Story']);" >The Google Story</a>&#8220;*, can take this tour. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t have drama that book unfolds but still an experience to remember!
