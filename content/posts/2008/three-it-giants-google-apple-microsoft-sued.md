The company, Cygnus, added that, its technology are being used in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Windows Vista, Apple’s Mac OS X and i-phone. Also, as of now only these three company are being sued, but there may be many other products as well, that may be using Cygnus’ technology without their permission.

According to reports, Google, Microsoft and Apple have not yet replied to the claims made by Cygnus. It would be interesting to know how these companies handle such a complicated situation.
