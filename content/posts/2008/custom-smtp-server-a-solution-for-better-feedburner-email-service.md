Last month I posted about <span style="line-height: normal;"><a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/06/27/feedburner-is-running-out-of-fuel-feeds-delayed-by-one-month-almost/">updates from FeedBurner email service</a> being delayed almost by one month. Then I posted <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/07/04/how-to-leave-feedburner-without-loosing-your-subscribers/">how to leave FeedBurner without loosing your existing subscribers</a> in case one want to switch to a new service.</span>

<span style="line-height: normal;">But like many bloggers, I don&#8217;t want to leave FeedBurner. It would be great if they just improve their email delivery system. <span style="line-height: 19px;">Now thinking <em>(seriously)</em> about solution, I reached to a new conclusion.</span></span>

Technically, one thing that may be seriously affecting FeedBurner email delivery, is high load on their SMTP servers. Of course this is hard to belive as Google fuels FeedBurner.

Now there are many forums, blogging software which allow you to specify custom SMTP server settings. If specified, third party SMTP server is used, instead of webhosts default mail function.

Coming back to FeedBurner, if they give similar option to publisher, one can use SMTP servers they find fast and trustworthy. Also publishers with custom SMTP server can be allowed to send one mail per post as they are not eating up FeedBurners&#8217; mailing resources.

Or FeedBurner can start a new paid service where publishers who are ready to pay extra will get timely email delivery as well as mail per post kind of option.

There is one more hidden good side to this approach. Such paid service will be highly appreciated by top bloggers who makes most money and most traffic as well. So if these biggies shift their load to custom SMTP servers or paid plans, overall quality of service will automatically improve for small blogger! ðŸ˜‰

What do you think about it?
