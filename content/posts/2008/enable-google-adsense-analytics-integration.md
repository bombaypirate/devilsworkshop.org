Google Adsense-Analytics integration is creating a lot of buzz and almost every blogger/publisher waiting for this integration to arrive on their AdSense account. Yes, Google is offering this integration option on-demand so first thing you have to do is fill-up <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pD9DqwPQLWy_y9v1JWdDFSQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pD9DqwPQLWy_y9v1JWdDFSQ', 'this small form']);" >this small form</a>.

Once you submit it, integration link will appear in your account as highlighted below within 24 hours.

[<img class="wp-image-53276" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="284" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/image-thumb1.png" width="570" border="0" />][1] 

Once you follow that link, you will be asked to integrate your existing Google Analytic account or if you don’t have one, you can create new Google Analytic account.</p> 

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="112" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/image-thumb2.png" width="506" border="0" />][2]

After that, you will be presented a list of websites (profiles) to link with AdSense. If you have only one blog/website its fine. Otherwise you can make a choice!

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="489" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/image-thumb3.png" width="536" border="0" />][3] 

Next you need to select primary domain in case you have multiple domains on your account. I don’t think this will make much difference except one presented in next step below.</p> 

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="591" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/image-thumb4.png" width="576" border="0" />][4] 

In final step, you will get new codes for non-primary domains. No code change is needed for primary domain. This is the only advantage of a choice you made in above step. There may be more to it, but it will become clear with time later on!

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="653" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/image-thumb6.png" width="592" border="0" />][5]&#160;

After this you will get Adsense performance results with a day in Analytics. The entire linking process is available as a video too. Watch it&#8230;</p> 

Do not forget to check following video to get maximum out of this integration. I am sure, careful usage of this feature will increase your sites overall revenue in coming days! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
