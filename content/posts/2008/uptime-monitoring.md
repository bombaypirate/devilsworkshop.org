<a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/', 'Down for Everyone or Just Me']);" >Down for Everyone or Just Me</a> is a very simple service which basically help you check if a particular website is down for everyone or just you!

If you are using free wi-fi on a public network, often it blocks some websites form opening. One such free wi-fi network near my home blocks all blogspot.com domain blogs and on top of it, they do not show any custom error message when I request a blogspot.com blog!

I remember for the first time, when I connected to it and saw all blogspot.com blogs down. For a moment, I thought I should post about it as many people think blogspot never goes down (and they are right as well). But then I wanted to make sure, if its unlucky me or overloaded Google! A simple service like this can help a lot in many situation.

The URL&#8217;s to result page have bookmarkable structure. Like you can <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/devilsworkshop.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/devilsworkshop.org', 'bookmark this']);" >bookmark this</a> to check if Devils Workshop is down for everyone or just you.

**Link: <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/', 'Down for Everyone or Just Me']);" >Down for Everyone or Just Me</a> **

**Server Monitoring&#8230;**

On registration, you can setup to monitor 1 server for free. For more than 1, they charge you accordingly. As most of blogger run only 1 main blog, free package is sufficient for most of us.

You can configure email notification on per server basis, for events like web downtime, email downtime, ftp downtime, etc.

I signed up for free account and configured email notification for Devils Workshop web downtime. I use Google Apps for emails.
