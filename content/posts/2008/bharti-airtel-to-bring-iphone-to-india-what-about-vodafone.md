Last week, [Vodafone announced to launch iPhone in India and 9 other countries][2]. Looks like they will get stiff competition in Indian market as Bharti Airtel, in its Press release announced that they have signed a deal with Apple to bring the iPhone to India, later this year.

[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/05/image-thumb16.png" border="0" alt="image" width="110" height="45" align="right" />][3] Airtel is India&#8217;s one of top telecom services provider with 62 million mobile customers. Airtel users can expect iPhone around Diwali, an Indian Festival which comes around October-November.

One step ahead, India&#8217;s leading newspaper, Times Of India, confirmed both, Airtel as well as Vodafone deal. This mean iPhone user will have 2 choice as per telecom operator is concerned. This is slightly unexpected as in US, Apple gave distribution right to only one company AT&T. Also giant like Vodafone also expected to put similar conditions while signing deal with Apple.

But considering size of Indian telecom market, both operators can get large number of iPhone users. Personally I will switch to Vodafone, at the time of buying iPhone. I wonder with Airtel pathetic GPRS service, iPhone will be of any use!

Anyways, competition is always good for consumers!
