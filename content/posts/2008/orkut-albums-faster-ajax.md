Noticed today change in Orkuts album navigation. Previous and Next image links *(highlighted in screenshot below)* now loads consecutive images using AJAX. In simple words when you click on these links now, they loads previous/next image in album without refreshing entire page. All this mean, you can browse orkut albums faster now.

<span style="line-height: normal"><img class="wp-image-51509" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/08/picture-2.jpg" alt="Picture 2.jpg" width="313" height="480" /></span>

This feature is still seems under experiment. I came across some weird messages and also loading indicator image which you can note in above screenshot is appearing in top-left corner for first image load.

Orkut can still improve many things with album navigation. May be they can do it the way I did it one year ago with my [AJAX Style Orkut album script][1]. I stopped updating that script, but still [this screenshot][2] can give you feeling of how it changed Orkut Album Navigation.

If you have any suggestion for better orkut album navigation, please share with us. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
