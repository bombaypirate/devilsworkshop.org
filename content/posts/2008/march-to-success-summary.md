In March only, our traffic, readership & earning gained new heights!

So here I am presenting quickly recap, of March month&#8230;

### \# Traffic

We received **54,457 unique visitors** and **more than 100K page views in **March only. As can be seen in following graph, I messed up things in February. But that mess taught me lots of things which together helped us march to success!

</p>

While in 50K visitors around 10K was from <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.stumbleupon.com/', 'stumbleupon']);" >stumbleupon</a> on post discussing [5 Best torrent search engines][2], I guess still 40K is good number. That means more than 1K unique visitors per day. Something I dreamt long time back&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### \# Readership

We also crossed **1000 FeedBurner readers** mark on 14 March. This is much more important than other things because at first I thought, it was some kind of spike and will eventually go down, but since that day the counter never went down below 1000!

Also as we have now [3 different feedburner feeds][3] alongwith many other feeds like comment feeds, the actual readers base is much larger than shown in <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~fc/rb286" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/~fc/rb286', 'FeedBurner counter']);" >FeedBurner counter</a>.

### \# Earnings $$$

On earnings front, total rise is around **6 times. **With this pace, it will be easier to switch to full-time blogging in June as per my current plans!

Our Google Adsense earning are **3 times** higher while rise in traffic is around **2 times**. In other income sources, <a href="http://www.kontera.com/ads-for-site/become-a-kontera-publisher?type=1&aff_ID=5568" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kontera.com/ads-for-site/become-a-kontera-publisher?type=1&aff_ID=5568', 'kontera']);" >kontera</a> earning **increased** by **7 times** and our affiliate earnings shoot up to **$128** from mere **$3** in February!

I will be sharing <span style="text-decoration: line-through">my secret</span> what worked for me with you in coming days!
