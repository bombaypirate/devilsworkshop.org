As we have [discussed][1] it earlier, orkut open social apps finally arrived in India.

Just noticed on my orkut homepage as shown in screenshot above, India has been chosen by Orkut second country [after Estonia][1] to unveil Orkuts open social apps.

Nevertheless no matter from which country you are, you can change your country to Estonia and now India to enjoy this cool apps. *([Read more&#8230;][1])*

It will be too early to say anything about Orkut Apps so soon, but as of now only thing I like notably that orkut apps don&#8217;t force you to invite 20 friends like facebook.

Anyway you can add these apps to your account by clicking on edit link as highlighted in following screenshot.

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="243" alt="Orkut open socail apps link" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/image-thumb24.png" width="389" border="0" />][2] 

Let us know what you think about these orkut apps? Will they really enhance your orkutting experience or will just clutter orkut profiles?

**Update:** Just read on <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/04/apps-are-live-in-india.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/04/apps-are-live-in-india.html', 'Orkut official blog']);" >Orkut official blog</a>, there is limit of **25 apps** a user can add.
