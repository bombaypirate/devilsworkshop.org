After [orkuts privacy features for profile content][1], now comes turn of orkut communities.

Yes now you can have private communities on orkut where all discussion, polls, events will be secret from non-community members. 

The feature can be used by all community owners by going to **edit profile** community link. Now **Edit community **page have a new setting &#8211; ***content privacy*&#160;**&#8230; (as shown below)

[<img class="wp-image-53866" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="259" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/image-thumb3.png" width="520" border="0" />][2] 

If you choose **hidden **option content from your community will no longer shown to non-members. I guess better approach would have been to hide&#160; entire community itself from directory listings as well as orkut search engine.

Finally a note for all dark-minded people&#8230; Wait before jumping out of your chair. as orkut can and will monitor content of these secret community! In fact secret communities should be monitored more&#8230; ðŸ˜‰
