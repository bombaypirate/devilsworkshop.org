Two month back, [Orkut community search feature][1] was broken. Now filters gone missing from orkuts user search feature.

[<img class="wp-image-52892" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/07/image-thumb1.png" border="0" alt="image" width="510" height="345" />][2]

If you never used it, orkut filters can be used smartly to refine search results very nicely. Long time back I even posted one [orkut dating trick][3] which uses search filters to find right match for you!

I am not sure if Orkut has removed these filters completely or it just gone missing in a recent update. It may happen that filters may come back with some improvements. Whatever is the reason maybe, Orkut never showed any love for search related feature.

I wonder what Sergey Brin & Larry Page *(Google co-founders)* will do to Orkut Buyukkokten *(orkut creator)*, if they come to know about laterâ€™s love for search features! ðŸ˜‰
