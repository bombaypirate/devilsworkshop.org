After [edit-all-photos at once][1] and [reorder photos using drag-n-drop features][1], one thing seriously needed on orkut was ability to upload unlimited photos.

Looks like orkut understood our need and now change the photo upload limit to 10000 photos as shown in above screenshot. Still per album limit is set to 100 photos but as of now there is no official limit on number of albums a user can create.

Well 10000 limit is not bad and I wonder if anyone will hit the limit naturally. Still unlimited photo upload option would have been much better. It will not make much difference technically, as very few users will ever consider to upload more than 10000 photos anyway. But its effect will be different as having no limit always make user feel better than having a very very large limit!

Another thing on album front orkut could improve is true and complete integration between orkut albums and picasa albums. Hope to see that soon in action as managing photos at two different places is really pain.

Finally if you are wondering on [how to upload photos in bulk][2], you can use another orkut feature described [here][2].
