But there is a problem with free services &#8211; **Ads**.

While for a service provider it becomes necessary to run ads in order to keep service free some do it so badly that user gets irritate. Some banners and flash ads just take forever to download on dial-up connection and for broadband users, waste precious bandwidth in their limited plan.

But if you are a firefox user then you can get rid of all ads on Internet, thanks to firefox&#8217;s adblock plus add-ons!

Most firefox users are aware of Adblock Plus (ABP) &#8211; most popular firefox addon! But to get most out of it, it must be used with Filtersets.

Filtersets make it easy for Adblock Plus to block ads on the new sites. There are many filtersets available for different set of sites. For English language sites, EasyList + EasyElement are best. I just started using it after reading [Ares comment][2]. I earlier used Filterset.G Updater which is officially not recommended by Adblock Plus developers as mentioned <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/faq_project#filterset.g" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://adblockplus.org/en/faq_project#filterset.g', 'here']);" >here</a>.

So just install these Adblock with your favorite filtersets and you will never see any ad again! Thanks Ares for very helpful comment&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
