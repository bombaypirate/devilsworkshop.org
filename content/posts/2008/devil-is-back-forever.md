More than a week ago, I <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/05/27/away-from-devils-workshop-editorial/" target="_blank">was on leave</a> from devils workshop to complete my academic formalities. Now as I am done with all the official stuff, I am back as a full-time blogger.

Yes, now this workshop (and so blogging) is not just my hobby but source of livelihood. This is very crucial time of my life. I chose blogging over many six-figure job offers that I received. My blogging income is still in a four-figure but thankfully (only) my dad is supporting my decision.

I thank you all for being with me for around two years. I specially like to thank <a href="http://www.insideorkut.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.insideorkut.com/', 'Darnell Clayton']);" target="_blank">Darnell Clayton</a> whose <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/12/23/now-its-earning-with-google-adsense/#comment-210" target="_blank">comment</a> for the first time made me think that I can try blogging as a full-time profession. I learned a lot from him. I am also grateful to my blogger friend <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/', 'Gaurav Dua']);" target="_blank">Gaurav Dua</a> who always made me run for orkut posts which makes 40% of this blog! ðŸ˜‰

ThreeÂ  bloggers I like to remember at this point are <a href="http://tech-buzz.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tech-buzz.net/', 'Thilak']);" target="_blank">Thilak</a>, <a href="http://www.labnol.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/', 'Amit Agarwal']);" target="_blank">Amit Agarwal</a> & <a href="http://www.problogger.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.problogger.net/', 'Darren Rowse']);" target="_blank">Darren Rowse</a>.

Now as I have all the time of my life, I like to complete many pending tasks. First, will be a new theme for this blog and next will be major changes to our free service <a href="http://www.orkutfeeds.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutfeeds.com/', 'orkutfeeds']);" target="_blank">orkutfeeds</a>. Being a coder, its hard for me to keep my hands off codes, specially PHP codes! So along with blogging, I will be coding few more small services in open-source as well as commercially as a freelancer.

Thank you all once again&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
