With recent [launch of Orkuts country-specific versions][1], something new was expected and it turn out to be country-specific privacy setting. You can call it Geo-privacy!

A new option is added on privacy settings page named &#8220;my networks&#8221; which let you control geographical regions from where people can view your profile or send you friend requests.

<img class="wp-image-51344" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/06/orkut-my-networks-privacy-settings-1.jpg" width="480" height="126" alt="orkut - My  Networks Privacy Settings-1.jpg" />

By default, it is set to county you have mentioned in your profile only. Means if you have changed your country sometime back to [Estonia to enjoy Orkut Apps][2], you may have become unavailable to friends from your country. ðŸ˜‰

No worries you can change this setting to global or any number of networks. But please note that this &#8220;my networks&#8221; setting is directly linked to &#8220;everyone&#8221; options you see in other privacy settings as explained below with example taken from official <a href="http://help.orkut.com/bin/answer.py?answer=95134" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://help.orkut.com/bin/answer.py?answer=95134', 'orkut help page']);" >orkut help page</a>.

> For example, if you choose the United States and Brazil as the only countries that can access your profile, then selecting &#8216;everyone&#8217; in your other privacy settings only accounts for orkut users who are in those two countries. This is not &#8216;everyone&#8217; on orkut, but only &#8216;everyone&#8217; in your network. Selecting &#8216;friends of friends&#8217; will also be restricted to &#8216;friends of friends&#8217; within your network, so a friend of a friend who lives outside of the United States or Brazil won&#8217;t be able to see your profile.

One more thing as I mentioned in my [Orkut App & Estonia hack post][2], Orkut restricts now changing country in your profile. An attempt to change country shows warning like below&#8230;

A nice step towards better privacy control by Orkut Team&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
