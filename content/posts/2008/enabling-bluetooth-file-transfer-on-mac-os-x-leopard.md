By default, file sharing over Bluetooth connection is disabled in Mac OS X Leopard. Even though scanning process from cellphone shows Mac in the list, when you try to send file **to** Mac, you get error like <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;file can not be sent&#8221;.</span>

So to **enable** file sending follow this&#8230;

  * Go to **System Preferences >> Internet & Network >> Sharing.** <span style="font-style: italic">(see screenshot)</span>
  * Just **tick** Bluetooth Sharing option. Note that, although you are getting file sharing related error, file sharing option have nothing to do with it.

Thats it! Do not waste your time on mobile forums. I already did! ðŸ˜‰
