  I am damn sure, you must be wondering whether I am talking about a &#8216;.com&#8217; domain or &#8216;.info&#8217;, if it is really .com then the domain provider must not be <a href="http://godaddy.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://godaddy.com', 'Godaddy']);" >Godaddy</a>.. aren&#8217;t you?. Infact, with a special promo code, Godaddy is providing &#8216;.com&#8217; domains just for 1.99 USD + 20 cent as ICANN fee (Total comes to <strong>$ 2.19 = Rs. 100/- approx.</strong>).

  Recently I stumbled over an <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/10/23/199-domain-registration-from-go-daddy/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/10/23/199-domain-registration-from-go-daddy/', 'article']);" >article</a> at weblogtoolscollection wherein&#160; this great deal was mentioned, and I thought of sharing this with all my viewers, so that you may save some hundred bucks if you are planning to go for a new domain in the recent days ;). While registering for your own domain, please take care that, you do no forget to enter the promo code i.e. &#8216;<strong>199TEST</strong>&#8216; else you will not be billed under the special price.

  I am not sure, how long this deal is open for, so it is advisable to make the transaction as soon as possible <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
