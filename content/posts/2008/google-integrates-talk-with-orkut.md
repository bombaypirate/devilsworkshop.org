  <strong>Google have just announced its integration of Gtalk with Orkut</strong>. Truly speaking this is the thing I was desperately waiting for and Google team have heard me. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Though the news about Gtalk and Orkut integration was leaked a fortnight ago on <a href="http://orkutplus.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutplus.net', 'Gaurav&#8217;s']);" >Gaurav&#8217;s</a> blog, I was waiting for some official news to be in. And a couple of hours ago, I was really happy to see this news on the official Orkut <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/11/fully-integrated-chat-in-orkut-thats.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/11/fully-integrated-chat-in-orkut-thats.html', 'blog']);" >blog</a> where they mentioned that they have started rolling out this feature into orkut profiles.

  Now you must be thinking about your privacy on Orkut. Keeping this point in mind and to prevent you from being bombarded with Instant Messages (IMs), they have some privacy features too.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Some key highlights of this integration:
</p>

  * <div align="justify">
      chat with your orkut friends in real time from directly within orkut
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      control which of your orkut friends can chat with you
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      chat with your Google Talk and Gmail chat contacts
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      visit different orkut pages while keeping your chatboxes open
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  I guess, as customary, Orkut is going to roll this feature on my profile at the end. So, if you are also yet to try your hands on this new feature, than just watch this demo video and have patience till you see it live on your profile.

  If this feature is available on any one&#8217;s profile, please do let us know your experience with it. Before leaving I would like to thank Google and Orkut team for rolling out new features every alternative day. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
