Last week, we celebrated [second anniversary][1] of Devils Workshop.

We organized three different giveaway event and few other things as part of celebration. Also few readers joined the party with return gifts. Owning to my own bad health I was mostly on bed rest for the last few days so this post got little delayed.

Now first I am grateful to <a href="http://www.funfilledblog.org/2008/06/14/happy-birthday-devils-workshop.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.funfilledblog.org/2008/06/14/happy-birthday-devils-workshop.htm', 'Johnson']);" >Johnson</a> who make me change my desktop background after long time. Below is screenshot of my desktop with background designed by him&#8230;

Johnson also designed few more wallpapers for Devils Workshop fans which can be found in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27645379@N02/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/27645379@N02/', 'flickr photo stream']);" >flickr photo stream</a>.

Now coming back to the party, <a href="http://entrecard.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://entrecard.com/', 'entrecard credits']);" >entrecard credits</a> giveaway and special advertising rate events are over now and results will be declared on **June 25**.

Free domain registration and hosting space event is **open till 23 June** so you can still participate for this. More details about this event can be found [here][1].

On personal front, I am feeling much better now and hopefully will resume normal blogging from tomorrow. Special thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/rahul286" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/rahul286', 'my twitter']);" >my twitter</a> friends for their *get well soon* wishes&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
