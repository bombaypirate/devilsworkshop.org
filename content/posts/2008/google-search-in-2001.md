[<img class="size-full wp-image-2191 alignright" title="google" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/10/google.jpg" alt="" width="200" />][1]In honor of their <a href="http://www.google.com/tenthbirthday/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/tenthbirthday/', '10th Birthday']);" >10th Birthday</a>, Google put oldest search engine index available online for use which dates back to 2001. This means you can use Google search as it was in 2001. It is not just home page or logo but also search result will be served from 2001.

Just out of curiosity I tried searching &#8220;Rahul Bansal&#8221; but I failed to get any result pointing to me! This is quite expected as in 2001, I did not know much about computers and Internet. I got my first computer at the end of 2002 and it was 2006, when I created this blog and my first web presence. More about this is posted on about page.

It was nice searching back in time. I experienced true time-travel as it was entirely different world. Of course, I could not follow most of the result. Search results are served from <a href="http://web.archive.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://web.archive.org/', 'wayback machines archives']);" >wayback machines archives</a>.

If you are a techie or student of computer science/engineering, you will also like this <a href="http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dxbnvvr_0sndrzjdq&skipauth=true" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dxbnvvr_0sndrzjdq&skipauth=true', 'powerpoint presentation']);" >powerpoint presentation</a> which describes <a href="http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dxbnvvr_0sndrzjdq&skipauth=true" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dxbnvvr_0sndrzjdq&skipauth=true', 'Google&#8217;s System Architecture']);" >Google&#8217;s System Architecture</a>. I had case study of Google as part of my M.Tech. course. Unfortunately, I failed to find other presentations which have details about Pagerank algorithm and general working of Search engine. Anyway below is what I found, rest you can always Google! ðŸ˜‰



If you are a Google fan, I am sure you will enjoy it.Â  Just out of curiosity, wanted to know if anyone here used Google Search back in 2001. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
