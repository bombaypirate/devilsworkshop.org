This is last post in my [first wordpress plugin series][1]. Rather than making your list larger by suggesting more plugins, in this post I will write summary of things which changed after this series experiment.

First and most important, now this blog allows its commentators to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-ajax-edit-comments/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-ajax-edit-comments/', 'edit their comments']);" >edit their comments</a> as suggested by <a href="http://www.funfilledblog.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.funfilledblog.org/', 'Johnson']);" >Johnson</a> & other readers. I will also enable <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/', 'paged navigation']);" >paged navigation</a> for archive pages soon, as suggested by <a href="http://www.techpavan.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techpavan.com/', 'Pavan']);" >Pavan</a>.

Also while preparing for this series, I revisited <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broken-link-checker/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broken-link-checker/', 'broken link checker plugin']);" >broken link checker plugin</a>. I stopped using it few months back after it broke itself with a wordpress version upgrade in past. I am using it now again. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Now after giving away list of my favorite plugins, I request wordpress bloggers here to share their favorite plugins.

Apart from this, personally I enjoyed this series writing experiment. It turned out to be more time-consuming than what I had expected. Thats why other topic got less attention in last week.

I will give some extra time in advance for my next series so this won&#8217;t happen in future again. Meanwhile, I would love to know what you like to read in next series. Few topics that are confusing me are AdSense, Ad Networks, Gmail, SEO tipc, Blogging tipc, Security (Hacking), etc.

Waiting for your feedback,
