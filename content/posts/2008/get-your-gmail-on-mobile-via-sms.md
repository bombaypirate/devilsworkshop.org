  Few days ago, we <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/get-orkut-scrap-alerts-delivered-as-sms-for-free/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> about how to get Orkut Scrap alerts as SMS and a lot of people were querying on how to get such notification for new E-mails that we get. Here is what you need to do for getting your emails delivered to your cell phone as SMS instantaneously.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  All this is done by SMS-to-Email service providers, currently offered by <a href="http://www.mobee.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mobee.in', 'Mobee']);" target="_blank">Mobee</a> and <a href="http://www.m3m.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.m3m.in', 'Mytoday']);" target="_blank">Mytoday</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <a href="http://www.mobee.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mobee.in', ' Mobee.in']);" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-53434" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/mobee-logo.gif" border="0" alt="mobee_logo" width="246" height="82" align="right" /> Mobee.in</a> has an awesome interface and delivers your mail of up to 400 characters butÂ  it is a premium service now, though for testing purpose you can avail a free account which will give you only 3 E-mail notification per day. But at any point of time, you may migrate to their premium plans which cost as little as Rs. 30 Per Month and gives some great features like, reply to a mail by SMS or forwarding any mail. And all this is operated using a non-premium ten digit mobile number which costs you as low as a normal SMS.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <a href="http://www.m3m.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.m3m.in', ' Mytoday']);" ><img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/m3m.png" border="0" alt="m3m" width="245" height="93" align="right" /> Mytoday</a>, on the other hand, another big player in SMS world, has also started such Email-to-SMS service for <em>&#8216;free&#8217;</em> under the name <a href="http://m3m.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m3m.in', 'Email2Sms']);" >Email2Sms</a> (M3M). Though the service is free, it has got certain limitations too. As a free user, you can only avail a limited alerts of 100 SMS notifications per year and if you wish to get unlimited SMS alerts, it will cost you a reasonable amount of 999 bucks per year. Any ways considering it to be free (upto 100 alerts/year), we can surely give it a try, also this is one time setup process.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Basically the whole system works by setting up an auto forwarding in your mail box to a specified mail id provided to you by the &#8216;Email-to-SMS&#8217; service provider. As per the service provider, all your Emails are being stored in an encrypted form and cannot be viewed by them. I am still wondering on how secure your personal data would be, so please use this service at your own risk. ðŸ˜‰ Further detailed instructions on setting up auto forwarding can be availed once you sign-up for the respective services.

  My Review: Personally, <a href="http://abhishekjain.co.cc" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://abhishekjain.co.cc', 'I']);" >I</a> have used both the services, Mobee was outstanding as I have used a premium version of it and have not got any complaints with it. M3M is equally good. You give it a try and let us know your comments on it.
