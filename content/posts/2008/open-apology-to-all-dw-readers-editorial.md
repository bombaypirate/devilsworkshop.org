Those who have noticed it yesterday, our author Saurvajit published a post announcing Scrap All feature officially arrived on Orkut.

It turned out to be a firefox extension he was using and being editor of this blog I accept my failure to crosscheck facts before approving article for publication.

I apologies to all DW readers for inconvenience caused by incorrect information.

Sorry once again,
