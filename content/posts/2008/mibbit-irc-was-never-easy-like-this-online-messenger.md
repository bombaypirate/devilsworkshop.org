All of them had one common problem &#8211; no support for Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Although many users prefer graphical and simple to use messengers like Google Talk, Yahoo, MSN, AIM, etc, IRC is still something many geeks can&#8217;t live without. But thanks to mibbit, now IRC is no more geeks territory. 

### [<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="399" alt="mibbit main window" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/image-thumb22.png" width="484" border="0" />][3] 

### Features&#8230;

  * Its free and registration is optional. 
  * Tabbed conversation windows will give you feel of desktop clients. 
  * Search feature to find IRC channels using keywords. Have database of 150,000+ channels across 49 IRC networks. 
  * Works behind **proxy**. I tested it behind corporate firewall but being a plain online service it worked like a charm! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * Built-in support for translation. You can translate your messages to another language or read others message in your language. 
  * Pastebin support. If you are a programmer then you know how often we go to pastebin to share codes. Now you can do it right from mibbit. 
  * Chat widget which you can add on your website *(live example below&#8230;)* 

**Registered User get additional options&#8230;**

  * **My channel option &#8211;** To save a list of favorite channels which can be automatically joined on logon. 
  * **Preferences &#8211; **set colors, fonts, configure alerts, etc. 
  * **Logs &#8211;** All conversations can be saved. This feature will be available soon. 

I personally use IRC channels when working on wordpress plugins and firefox add-ons. But I always had some problems on windows machine. I don&#8217;t like to pay for mIRC and xchat (windows version). Also <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16', 'chatzilla']);" >chatzilla</a> failed to impress me as it doesn&#8217;t work behind firewalls in offices & colleges.

So I guess mibbit is best for windows, specially when you want to waste your office time! ðŸ˜‰
