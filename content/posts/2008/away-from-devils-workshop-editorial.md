Dear Readers,

You might have noticed that this blog is not updated from last 3 days.

No, I am not dead. I am just too busy with college & company work. This is last week of my 19 years of academic life and 1 year of corporate life.

I will be back in June first week, as full time blogger as well as freelancer. Then I will be posting many exicitng series and also coding few small sevices which you may respond with WOW!

This is to just let you know that I care about you readers and I really hate backlog in answering comments. But thing here are beyond my control so please do not unsubscribe.

Meanwhile, feel free to comment on any topic as I will be answering all comments on regular basis, before hitting the bed every night.

I am going through biggest transition of my life and I hope you will support me as you always did. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Thanking You, Your Devil&#8230;
