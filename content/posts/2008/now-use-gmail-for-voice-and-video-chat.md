Ironically, this feature is introduced first on the browser instead of messenger. Since long Gtalk was missing the feature of video calling which is now fulfilled by this brand new addon &#8211; Gmail for Voice and Video Chat. Seems, this new innovation is going to bring a stiff competition on the net telephony market, also the launch can be a red alert for Skype too.

Isn&#8217;t it? Well, as highlighted on the image, after installing the plugin, just use the &#8216;Video & more&#8217; button to get started. To help you understand better, I have also included a video tutorial at the bottom of this article.
