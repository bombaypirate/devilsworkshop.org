**Update: **This spam attack lasted for around 6 hours. After checking few spam mails I am sure that noboday attacked my email address. During same time frame, spam folder was empty. That makes it further sure that Gmails spam filters were crashed. Everything is normal now&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
