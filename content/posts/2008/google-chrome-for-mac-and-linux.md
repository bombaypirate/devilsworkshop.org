Google&#8217;s open source browser is now unofficially ported to Mac and Linux by geeks at <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.codeweavers.com/', 'CodeWeavers']);" >CodeWeavers</a>.

Officials ports for non-Windows OS are under-development and will take some time to hit your desktops. But those who are eager, can try <a href="http://chromium.codeweavers.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chromium.codeweavers.com/', 'Crossover Chromium']);" >Crossover Chromium</a>.

On Mac, it will support Intel based OS X 10.4 or higher. PowerPC Macs are not supported. On Linux side you can run it on almost all distributions.

Crossover is a standard Mac app which allows you to install many popular Windows applications and games on your Intel OS X Mac.

I tested it on my Macbook Pro. It took a lot of time for first-time initialization. And Overall application performance is also bad. I hope Linux users find some better result. Personally, I will wait for official Port. I don&#8217;t like Chrome much but as a web-developer I have to check my designs and services in Chrome to as it is gaining large pie of browser market share.
