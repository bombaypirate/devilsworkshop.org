In their terms, <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;Promoting Beauty 2.0"</span>. </span>

<span style="line-height: 19px">Zivity offers a social networking platform focused on <em>&#8220;sexy models and beautiful photography.&#8221;</em> Do not confuse it with adult dating site to hook-up. May be it is a reason, it became first adult content site to get venture capital funding in silicon valley and that&#8217;s too <strong>$8,000,000.</strong></span>

Zivity has a unique business model that pays models and photographers directly based on the number of user-votes they receive. With a minimum $5 subscription, members receive 5 votes that they can cast for models and photography they find appealing, with $0.80 out of every $1 vote being distributed to the model and photographer. Out of $0.60 goes to the model and $0.20 goes to the photographer. There is no limit on the amount of money that a photographer or model can make; as long as a photo remains popular, models and photographers will share in ongoing royalties whilst retaining full ownership of the pictures.

She is also modeling on Zivity and in her words, &#8220;I don&#8217;t take my clothes off just to promote Zivity. I also do it for the model community and for myself. I want to change how people view nudity and beauty&#8230; I really enjoy being on Zivity and being nude and sexy in photographs is enjoyable!&#8221; Notably, Cyan won the &#8220;Sexiest Geek Alive&#8221; award, in 2000, when she was just 22.

Currently in beta, Zivity is open to top models, photographers and a group of beta testers. If you are interested, you can apply for beta testing <a href="http://zivity.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://zivity.com/', 'here']);" >here</a>.
