This is not a tech-article but I hope most geeks will like this.

Following is video footage of Commencement address by Steve Jobs, Apple CEO, delivered on June 12, 2005, to the graduates of Stanford University. In his speech Jobs talked about 3 small stories from his life. They are really motivating and inspiring to all geeks who want to swim against the stream&#8230;
