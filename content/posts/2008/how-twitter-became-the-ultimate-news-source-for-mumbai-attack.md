<a href="http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-50484" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 10px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="142" alt="#mumbai" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/11/mumbai.png" width="355" align="right" border="0" /></a> All my family members set glued to TV sets to view coverage on the Mumbai attacks, but not me. I found that Twitter worked faster than anything else. For those who don&#8217;t know what Twitter is, I&#8217;ll tell you about it some other day. Well, it was even reported that TV channels used the hash tag <a href="http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai', '#Mumbai']);" >#Mumbai</a> to get scrolling messages for their channels. Telegraph.co.uk <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/3530640/Mumbai-attacks-Twitter-and-Flickr-used-to-break-news-Bombay-India.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/3530640/Mumbai-attacks-Twitter-and-Flickr-used-to-break-news-Bombay-India.html', 'says']);" >says</a> "Mumbai attacks: Twitter and flickr used to break news". Even I found #<a href="http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai', 'Mumbai']);" >Mumbai</a> tag on twitter was working really awesome and faster than any other news channels on the main stream. Even at this point of time ( 7:30 A.M. IST ) I can see a lot of tweeters, tweeting live from various places and sharing their experience about the Mumbai incident. Just a couple of seconds ago I got a tweet that another blast has occurred, but there isn&#8217;t any such information on TV yet..

<a href="http://arunshanbhag.com/2008/11/27/mumbai-blasts-day-2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://arunshanbhag.com/2008/11/27/mumbai-blasts-day-2/', '']);" ><img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="281" alt="taj attack" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/11/taj-attack.jpg" width="489" border="0" /></a> 

Another hash tag #<a href="http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbaifamilies" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbaifamilies', 'mumbaifamilies']);" >mumbaifamilies</a> was created for people who want to know about their relatives residing in Mumbai. As asked by many of my friends, you too may think that twitter is no way official and may distort the news. To this point, I&#8217;ll say that to a wrong tweet, there are hundreds of tweeters to correct them. So I think twitter can be believed and so does some news agencies too. Many tweeters even posted links to their photo stream with a lots of pics of those disastrous scenes. For instance <a href="http://www.twitter.com/vinu" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twitter.com/vinu', '@Vinu']);" >@Vinu</a> put many photos on his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinu/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/vinu/', 'flickr stream']);" >flickr stream</a>. I found many social activists too on twitter popping in with tweets about latest happenings there, one among them is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dina" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twitter.com/dina', '@dina']);" >@dina</a> who also <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/11/27/blogger.india.mood.mehta.cnn?iref=videosearch" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/11/27/blogger.india.mood.mehta.cnn?iref=videosearch', 'reported']);" >reported</a> for the CNN International as a citizen reporter.

  There were even <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/9863/report-indian-government-trying-to-block-twitter-as-terrorists-may-be-reading-it/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.inquisitr.com/9863/report-indian-government-trying-to-block-twitter-as-terrorists-may-be-reading-it/', 'rumors']);" >rumors</a> that Indian govt. is planning either to ban twitter or ask them to block Mumbai related tweets as this may help those terrorist get vital information. But yet with any such official information. If you are also excited to know about the happenings at Mumbai you can check out Mumbai&#8217;s hash tag #<a href="http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hashtags.org/tag/mumbai', 'Mumbai']);" >Mumbai</a>.
