Google AdSense&#8217;s video unit appeared for the first time in Indian publishers account. I just checked my AdSense account and its there for the first time.

**About Earning from Video Unit&#8230;**

> ** ** When you place a video unit on your website, you&#8217;ll earn revenue from two types of ad formats: companion ads, which sit above your video content within the player and can be either text or image-based, and text overlay ads, which appear in the bottom 20% of the video content area. Ads on video units can be paid on either a cost-per-click or cost-per-thousand impression basis. *(via <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=90514" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=90514', 'AdSense help page']);" >AdSense help page</a>)*

After following **Video Units** link, it took me through ToS confirmationÂ  and YouTube account linking. At the end of it I was able to design my own AdSense-enabled player. As part of designing process, one can choose size, color as well as keywords & categories for custom AdSense player.

**Below is my first AdSense enabled video player&#8230;**

<div>
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/browse" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/browse', 'Watch the latest videos on YouTube.com']);" >Watch the latest videos on YouTube.com</a>
</div>
