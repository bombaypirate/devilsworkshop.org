  Keeping in mind the stiff competition in the field of social networking sites, it seems even the Orkut team is heading towards innovating new things.. Recently Orkut announced the <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/10/keeping-orkut-beautiful.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/10/keeping-orkut-beautiful.html', 'launch']);" >launch</a> of Adult content filters and now &#8216;Reply by chat&#8217; option. Firstly this feature appeared on the photo album of a Orkut guide, mentioning as a bug. But later on it was discovered that the fact was completely vague, rather it was a new feature introduced <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  On the screen shot above, you can clearly notice a new option &#8216;Reply by chat&#8217;, <strong>when clicked on it, the user is directed over to Gtalk window and a new conversation with the sender is automatically initiated</strong>. As far I&#8217;ve noticed this <strong>feature is available across the Orkut profile</strong>, from scrapbook to photo commenting, etc.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Also, do not get pissed if you do not find this option on your profile, as <strong>this option will be visible only if the sender of the scrap is currently online</strong> <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  It has also come to light, from Orkut <a href="http://http://groups.google.com/group/orkut-help-profiles/browse_thread/thread/304d003c8482916b/4c769ff80225c84c?lnk=raot&pli=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://http://groups.google.com/group/orkut-help-profiles/browse_thread/thread/304d003c8482916b/4c769ff80225c84c?lnk=raot&pli=1', 'help group']);" >help group</a> that, this feature was implemented on 1st of November ðŸ˜‰
