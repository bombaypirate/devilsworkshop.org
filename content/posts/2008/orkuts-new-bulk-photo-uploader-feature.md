If you are new on orkut then you might have reserved coming Sunday to fill up your orkut album as uploading 100 pics takes some time! Well you can save your Sunday by using orkuts new bulk photo uploader which let you upload multiple pics at once. Strangely orkut implemented this feature using ActiveX control which means this will work with Internet Explorer(IE) only. So no donut for firefox & non-IE users including me! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Anyway IE user can read on&#8230;

When you will go to your album to upload pics, you will see a <a href="http://www.orkut.com/PhotosUpload.aspx?uid" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/PhotosUpload.aspx?uid', 'new link']);" >new link</a> as shown in following screenshot&#8230;

[<img class="wp-image-53197" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="117" alt="Orkut Bulk Photo Uploader" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/orkut-bulk-photo-uploader-thumb.jpg" width="520" border="0" />][1] 

&#160;

Click on it will lead you to ActiveX Installation page. This is one-time procedure only!

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="456" alt="Orkut Bulk Photo Uploader2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/orkut-bulk-photo-uploader2-thumb.jpg" width="500" border="0" />][2]

&#160;

After installation you will see a new ***add photos*** button in albums. Clicking on will open windows standard open file box. You can select multiple files at once. You need to click ***save*** button (not shown in following screenshot). Do not try drag-n-drop! It won&#8217;t work&#8230;

&#160;

Once you done with adding photos, click ***upload photo*** button! 

&#160;[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="448" alt="Orkut Uploading Pics Progress" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/image-thumb4.png" width="431" border="0" />][4] 

&#160;

Thats it&#8230; All pics will be uploaded at once!

The feature is nice but orkut could have done this using Java applets instead of ActiveX. Its strange to see orkuts parent company Google actively endorses firefox but a nice feature like this disappoints firefox user community big time!
