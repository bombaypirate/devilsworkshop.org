If you have ever used GPRS (Abbreviation for General Packet Radio Service), you must be knowing, it is too clumsy and cumbersome task to open a non WAP based site on your mobile device, as the browsing speed of a traditional GPRS connection remains too slow. As such, if you own a blog or a website, you need to create a mobile friendly version of your blog to let your visitors access it from their mobile devices with ease. But you may not want to waste your time dabbling around things to create a mobile version blog. If it is so, you have reached the right place.

  In this post I am going to explain, how you can create a mobile friendly version of your blog in just a couple of minutes even if you don&#8217;t have enough technical knowledge. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="http://www.mofuse.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mofuse.com', 'Mofuse']);" >Mofuse</a> is a service which lets you mobilize a mobile version of your blog that to without any cost. All you need to do is just open an account at <a href="http://www.mofuse.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mofuse.com', 'mofuse.com']);" >mofuse.com</a> and request them to create a mobile version of your blog or website, after that you will be required to fill a small form with your blog URL and feed URL and your are done! A mobile version of your blog would be ready to use by then. The output will be as shown in the screenshot here. Initially, for mobile use, you will be provided with a sub-domain in <a href="http://www.mofuse.mobi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mofuse.mobi', 'mofuse.mobi']);" >mofuse.mobi</a> but later on you can configure it according to your choice by changing CNAME record of your own domain (If you own one). I used <a href="http://m.mobilegyaan.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.mobilegyaan.com', 'http://m.mobilegyaan.com']);" >http://m.mobilegyaan.com</a> for my blog.

  Hang on!! This is not all. There are even better things to discuss which I missed out to say. If you are a WordPress user, Mofuse comes with a free plugin using which you can automatically redirect all your mobile readers to the mobile friendly version of your blog. Except this there are many other customization options, like reader count chicklet, QR coding, Monetizing viewers, etc. Now you just need to explore this service to know more about it.
