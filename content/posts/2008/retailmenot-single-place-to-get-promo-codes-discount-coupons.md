<a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.retailmenot.com/', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-51385" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/09/retailmenotlogo-thumb.png" border="0" alt="RetailMeNot-logo" width="240" height="60" align="right" /></a> Everytime someone says promo code, I remember not using one while signing up for [Dreamhost][1] and so loosing $97 in discount. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I made a mistake as I was new to Internet and had no one to help me out. But when I realized my mistake, I started searching and ended up on this site – <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.retailmenot.com/', 'RetailMeNot.com']);" >RetailMeNot.com</a>. Since that day, I never missed any promo code or discount coupon.

### About RetailMeNot…

Its a very simple but highly useful, one of its kind site where users/site owners/service provider share promo codes they know with site name on which they work. Then as a consumer, you go to RetailMeNot, type website name in its simple search box and hit enter. Search result page instantly show promo codes with small description, ranking, user comments and other info.

To get better idea check <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/view/godaddy.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.retailmenot.com/view/godaddy.com', 'RetailMeNot page for GoDaddy']);" >RetailMeNot page for GoDaddy</a>. Yes, you can bookmark RetailMeNot pages for sites where you shop often!

### RetailMeNot Firefox Addon…

Now if you are a lazy consumer, then you can use RetailMeNot Firefox Addon to automate promo code hunting. This small <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4980" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4980', 'firefox addon']);" >firefox addon</a> checks if promo code is available for site you are visiting automatically. If promo codes are available then a small notification is shown on top side of page which lists few top ranked promo codes and link to page consisting all promo codes.

### When RetailMeNot have no promo codes…

It may happen RetailMeNot have no promo codes for site you are visiting. But it does not mean promo codes don’t exist for that site. Or there may be even better promo code exist at other places in some cases. For example, check <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/view/dreamhost.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.retailmenot.com/view/dreamhost.com', 'Dreamhost page on RetailMeNot']);" >Dreamhost page on RetailMeNot</a>. They do not have any of [Dreamhost special promo codes worth $200 discount][2]!

So whenever in doubt, use google to find promo codes that are not listed elsewhere. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
