After waiting for so long to update their user interface, Facebook finally released much awaited new interface.

[<img class="wp-image-53141" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="78" alt="New Facebook Link" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/08/image-thumb.png" width="248" border="0" />][1] 

You can see above **Try it now** link in top-right corner.

Below in new homepage which is much more organized and light-weight. Also common tasks Status Update, Adding Photos & Videos, Sharing Link are easily accessible as you can see below.

Also News Feed now can be browsed for items of interest.

As I discussed in recent Orkut posts. Facebook application used to make profile pages a lot heavier. Now profile pages are also changed drastically.

Profiles pages are now multi-tab with separate tab for wall, Info, Photos & Boxes. I hope no application will ever come out of Box nowâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰

Also now you can directly post photos, videos, etc from your facebook profile page. Moreover you can filter your wall posts now. 

I am still exploring and will update soon if I find something really great. All I can sayâ€¦ I am loving it! ðŸ˜‰
