Few months back, [orkut added support for Images, Videos and other HTML in scrapbooks][1], now on similar lines these cool HTML features are extended to orkut communities.

You can see following screenshot where HTML, image & video shown in a forum post.

### To enable this feature.

Yes, by default its disabled&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

1. Go to your communities **edit profile** link in left sidebar menu&#8230;![][3]

2. Next check **type** setting. If its public you have to change it to moderated as the feature is only available to moderated communities.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-977" title="orkut-community-type" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/orkut-community-type.jpg" alt="orkut-community-type" width="463" height="144" />][5]

3. Finally scroll down an look for **forum** setting. A new check-box will be there saying- ***&#8220;<span class="msgdiv"><label for="enableHtmlForum">allow HTML posts in </label></span>**<span class="msgdiv"><label for="enableHtmlForum">forums</label></span>&#8220;. ***Just check it!

### How To Post Images, Videos, etc&#8230;

*(Added on April 20, 2008)*

  * **Adding images**  
    Copy and paste urls ending in .jpg, .gif, .png or .bmp and the image will appear in the scrap.  
    for example, http://example.com/example.jpg

  * **Adding videos from YouTube and Google Video**  
    Copy and paste the url and the video will appear in the scrap.  
    for example, http://youtube.com/watch?v=videoid

  * **Adding podcast/audio**  
    Copy and paste the url of an audio file and an audio player will appear in the scrap.  
    for example, http://example.com/example.mp3

  * **Adding html-embeddable objects**  
    Create or upload your content at sites such as photobucket.com, imageshack.com, rockyou.com or slide.com. Copy and paste the html embed code to share it with your friends.

I think many community owner will not like requirement to make the community moderated type in order to use this feature. It seems orkut is worried about spam and security, but orkut is bad at handling both problems anyway&#8230; ðŸ˜‰
