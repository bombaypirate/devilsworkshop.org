##### **How does it work?**

You&#8217;ll be randomly paired with a partner who&#8217;s online and using the feature. Over a two-minute period, you and your partner will:

  * View the same set of images.
  * Provide as many labels as possible to describe each image you see.
  * **Receive points when your label matches your partner&#8217;s label.** The number of points will depend on how specific your label is.
  * See more images until time runs out.

More details, tips & example are at this <a href="http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/', 'services&#8217; page']);" >services&#8217; page</a>.

**Now what&#8217;s so cool about this?**

Many services ask user to contribute directly or indirectly and they have a group of people who moderate user contribution. Now such a human-intervention is impractical considering huge number of images being indexed by Google&#8217;s image search.

Now as described above, this random partnering approach removes any server side intervention completely. So the Google&#8217;s job is getting done without recruiting any human!

**Whats in it for you?**

All you get is points for your contribution. Anything about prizes or monetary benefit is not mentioned anywhere, but considering Google&#8217;s history of being generous, it will not be a surprise if top contributors receive any gift from Google in future. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
