After Googles introduction of [invisible status mode in Gmail Chat][1] and improved [privacy options for orkut users][2], its facebooks&#8217; turn to do something better for facebook users privacy. And they really come-up with much better and easier to use privacy controls.

One new option really caught my eyes is ability to control who can see your **online status!**

You can find this option is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=profile" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=profile', 'profile privacy controls']);" >profile privacy controls</a> as shown in screenshot below..

<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="474" alt="facebook profile privacy option" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/03/facebook-profile-privacy-option.jpg" width="503" border="0" /> 

If you set it as **No one **then you won&#8217;t show up in other <a href="http://www.facebook.com/friends/?online" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/friends/?online', 'online friend-list']);" >online friend-list</a> even when you are logged into orkut!

By the way if facebook is willing to offer this level of privacy feature then they should have added it to top-menu bar or on home page. A optional check box on homepage saying *"sign me invisibly",* like its there on many messengers sign-in screen, could be much better as people often like to switch their visibility depending on work load, etc.
