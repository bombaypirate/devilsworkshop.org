  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/checklist.jpg"><img class="wp-image-53272" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="253" alt="checklist" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/checklist-thumb.jpg" width="190" align="right" border="0" /></a> Many a times, after hitting the &#8216;publish&#8217; button, I realized what I missed out or what additional things could have been done to attract more visitors. Later on, I realized the need of a checklist that I should make use of before hitting the &#8216;publish&#8217; button. I discovered that the checklist really helped me out, as such I wanted to write about it, to help budding bloggers and other Co-authors of this blog.
</p>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Catchy Headline:<br /></strong>To attract maximum people to read an article, an article must have a good, simple and a catchy headline.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Opening Contents:<br /></strong>You must avoid writing off-the-topic and bogus things on the opening lines of your post, specially in the first paragraph. If you do so, many readers will go away from your blog ultimately affecting your blog and its credibility.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Spell Check:<br /></strong>This is another important aspect, every blogger must practice. If yuo mkae scuh splleing erorrs, agian it mya aeffect yuor bolg. You can imagine how annoying spelling errors are, from the preceding line. ðŸ˜‰ So, you must never forget to run spell check before you feel, your post is ready to be published.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Grammatical Errors:<br /></strong>Again, by this point your readers will judge you and your writing skills which ultimately would affect your earnings and revenue. So, after you complete writing the whole article, read it back atleast once to find any grammatical errors.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Bullets & Text Formatting:<br /></strong>Readers usually tend to read the whole articles in brief, as such highlighting important things and making use of bullets should really help.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Images:<br /></strong>There&#8217;s a famous saying &#8220;A picture is worth a thousand words&#8221; and I too feel the same. If you make use of a related image, it will further add stars to your article. Also, do never forget to rename the image relating to the contents of your blog as it is good for SEO.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Alignments:<br /></strong>To make your post look decent and give an appealing look, I strongly feel, you should never publish your post leaving the whole text unaligned. For aligning the article you should prefer &#8216;Justify&#8217; option. Also, if any images are used you must align them with proper margins and wrapping.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Back-Links:<br /></strong>On the bottom of every post, you must add links of various things your wrote about in the whole article. For example if I am writing an article about &#8216;Opening a new Gmail account&#8217; then on the bottom of post I should link to related pages like <a href="http://www.gmail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gmail.com', 'Gmail']);" target="_blank">Gmail</a> | <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?service=mail&continue=http://mail.google.com/mail/e-11-11113b70701586f8e2b9ce05d1d5289e-bec34aae01c4a787d52c34097caf5902dce687cf&type=2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?service=mail&continue=http://mail.google.com/mail/e-11-11113b70701586f8e2b9ce05d1d5289e-bec34aae01c4a787d52c34097caf5902dce687cf&type=2', 'Registration']);" target="_blank">Registration</a> | <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/about.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/about.html', 'About']);" target="_blank">About</a>
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Sources, Credentials and Related Articles<br /></strong>Never forget to add links and give credits to those blogs or websites where you basically saw the articles you are writing about. By this your readers may not blame you, upto some extent, if the information you blogged about is false. Also adding up related articles on the bottom of every post is another tactic many pro blogger follow. This way, you can keep your readers stuck to your blog ultimately resulting in increase of your revenue and profits. ðŸ˜‰
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      <strong>Categories and Tags:<br /></strong>Not to mention, this is the most important thing you must look. This will help your blog reader to browser your blog posts category wise and would also be helpful for locating similar articles.
