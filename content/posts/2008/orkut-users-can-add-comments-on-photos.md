Thanks to a new feature on orkut, now user can add comments on photos. As you can see in above screenshot, I have added a comment on my own photo. You can do this on any photo you have access to.

You can also check all comments on your photos by going to <a href="http://www.orkut.com/PhotoComments.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/PhotoComments.aspx', 'photo comments page']);" >photo comments page</a>. It has a nice format as shown below&#8230;

<img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/05/orkut-photo-comments-page.jpg" alt="orkut - Photo comments page.jpg" width="480" height="113" />

In every row on that page, first photo on which comment received is shown, next to it photo of commentator shown followed by actual comment.

Strangely there is no delete button besides comment. So if you receive any offensive comment you need to go to that photo page to delete it. Also there is no notification sent whenever a comment is posted on your photo. So it is strongly recommended for female users to keep a watch on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/PhotoComments.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/PhotoComments.aspx', 'photo comments page']);" >photo comments page</a> to avoid embarrassment.

This is another facebook like feature orkut team has given after [status update feature][1].
