Lifeinlines is aimed at hobbyist bloggers and dairy writers who loose in fast pace of life after enthusiastic start beyond few posts or <span style="line-height: normal"><span style="line-height: 19px">diary</span> <span style="line-height: 19px">writers who like to record their life but lost in its fast pace!</span></span>

In their own words, &#8220;<span style="line-height: normal"><span style="line-height: 19px">As you go about your day, Lifeinlines helps you capture and record your thoughts, feelings and experiences. So whether it&#8217;s waking up to the sound of music every morning, surviving a torturous presentation by a superior or getting teary eyed while watching your baby take his/her first step, Lifeinlines is your life&#8230; in lines.</span><span style="line-height: 19px">&#8220;</span></span>

<img style="float:right" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/06/lifeinlinescom-1.jpg" alt=" LifeInLines.com-1.jpg" width="207" height="166" />Lifeinlines is nicely integrated with everyday technology you use. You can SMS the sweet though just crossed your mind or simply capture the folk song at street and MMS it. If you are an online bug like me just keep posting via email/messenger or simply use their web interface. LiL is always there!

Apart from convenience, you also get a choice of assigning a level of privacy to everything you say or tell. You can choose to keep some things to yourself, whisper it to someone special, share with your best friends, close friends, all friends or make it public by a simple click. This nice multi-layer privacy is something every microblogging till date failed t incorporate.

Currently invitation only Lifeinlines will be open to all soon. Personally I can invite **25 friends**, so if you want to tell story of your life, just post a comment with &#8220;Invite me&#8221; words in it. Thanks Ankur for inviting me&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**Updates: Forgot to mention&#8230;**

  * An input mode,  ***voice 2 web ***&#8211; making a phone call to record your voice which is instantly posted to the web.
  * **No post size limit&#8230; **So  this can be used for normal blogging too&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
