This is Rahul Bansal, Founder, Admin & Chief Editor, Devils Workshop.

Many of you have noticed that I was away from our workshop for more than a month. There were some personal problems which kept me away from this blog and other work. Although I couldnâ€™t write in last month, I was always working at backstage and kept expanding parent company rtCamp.

I have noticed many of our readers left (unsubscribed) during one last month. Those who enjoyed my writing, please donâ€™t make it point to leave Devils Workshop. I have so much to share with you guys and I wonâ€™t make you wait for it any more.

Now I am back with a better plan for our workshop, I want to take this as an opportunity to talk only about good and positive thingsâ€¦

<a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=17131020411019753927" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=17131020411019753927', '']);" ><img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin-left: 0px;border-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="132" alt="Deepak Jain" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/11/deepakjain.jpg" width="154" align="right" border="0" /></a> First I want to thank Deepak Jain (Editor, Devils Workshop) and all guest authors who kept Devils Workshop running. Deepak worked really hard and improved a lot as a blogger. He earned first permanent position at Devils Workshop on November 5th, 2008. I know this should have been announced with a dedicated post but its not too late to congratulate Deepak and ask for treat! ðŸ˜‰

We are now bigger family. Mayur Somani&#160; and Vivek Jain are next 2 members of rtCamp family. Mayur joined us on November 10.&#160; Vivek is under training and expected to get a position in development team within a week. 

We are also working on many new products, blogs and services whose outcome will start appearing soon. Canâ€™t reveal more about them right now. You know business secretâ€¦. ðŸ˜‰

Now I want only one thing from you guysâ€¦ Whatever queries you have, please ask them at [forum][1]. I have so much to do so that from now on, no question will be answered via email, orkut scrapbooks, facebook walls, messages, etc. Please use [forum][1] only. 

Since last morning I spend more than 20 hours answering more than 500 emails, comments and posts at forum. If I accidentally missed your question then please bring it to my notice. I always loved to reply all queries which are in line with our [comment policy][2].

For guest bloggers, we have few surprises lined up. So start writing! Also as per demand by some authors we are considering to bring in a <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p3byVMlodPzU14IZEJdIiFQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p3byVMlodPzU14IZEJdIiFQ', 'new revenue sharing model']);" >new revenue sharing model</a>. Take this <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p3byVMlodPzU14IZEJdIiFQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p3byVMlodPzU14IZEJdIiFQ', 'small survey']);" >small survey</a> to help us serve our community better. 

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to comment.

Thanks again,

-Rahul Bansal
