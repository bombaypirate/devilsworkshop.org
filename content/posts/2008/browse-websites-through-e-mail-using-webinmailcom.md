  <a href="http://www.webinmail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.webinmail.com', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-50474" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="71" alt="webinmail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/11/webinmail.png" width="294" align="right" border="0" /></a> This is a new venture by <a href="http://www.rediffmail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rediffmail.com', 'Rediffmail']);" >Rediffmail</a> using which you can browse websites on your E-mail client like Outlook Express and blackberry devices. This service would be really useful for those corporate employees and students who are usually barred from browsing websites other than their work related ones.

  The interface and the working of this website it too simple. No registration, no payment, no waiting time or whatsoever. All you need to do is just send an email to "<a href="mailto:browse@webinmail.com">browse@webinmail.com</a>" with the URL of the website that you want to browse on the subject line, leaving the body part blank. You will receive a auto reply with the contents of the specified website in body part of the mail. For example I sent an email to <a href="mailto:browse@webinmail.com">browse@webinmail.com</a> in the subject line "<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org">http://devilsworkshop.org</a>" and here is how I got the reply. Further if you want to open a link of the home page then you&#8217;ll need to click on the link that would send another mail and you&#8217;ll have to wait another couple of seconds to get reply for that mail.

  Though the appearance of the mail is not that appealing as in the actual blog/ website, it is manageable. Moreover, the whole process is quite lengthy and cumbersome but it can be of real use at times and at places where access to website browsing is limited. Also, you can place query. For this you need to enter your search text on the subject line and the Google result of the specified search will be mailed back to your inbox. Well, to understand this service better you give it a try of your own and also do not forget to use this cool service, next time when browsing is being restricted in your office. ðŸ˜‰
