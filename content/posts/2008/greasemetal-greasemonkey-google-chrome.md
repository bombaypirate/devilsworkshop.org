Despite a lot of buzz about Google Chrome, one thing which is preventing many Firefox users from making a switch is, no support for third-party addons/plugins in Google Chrome.

If all you want is one firefox plugin, GreaseMonkey, then there is a software called <a href="http://greasemetal.31tools.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://greasemetal.31tools.com/', 'GreaseMetal']);" >GreaseMetal</a> out there, which can for time being make most userscripts developed for GreaseMonkey work in Google Chrome.

GreaseMonkey is small exe file. Just download it and install it. If your are installing it from Google Chrome itself, then it will ask you to restart your browser.

Once installed, it will create a directory named **userjs **in your *My Document *folder, as highlighted below.

All you need to do now, copy all userscripts you want to use in Google Chrome to **userjs** folder.

Please note that some GreaseMonkey scripts may not work in Google Chrome even after using above hack. Notably scripts which are using GreaseMonkey API functions.

It would have been better if <a href="http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/kazuhoatwork/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/kazuhoatwork/', 'Kazuho']);" >Kazuho</a>, GreaseMetal’s developer, provided option to use Firefox’s userscripts folder.

Google already hinted that future versions of Google Chrome will have support for addons, so it you are eager to make a switch, GreaseMetal is here to help!
