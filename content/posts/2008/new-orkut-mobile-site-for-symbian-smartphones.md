[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1664" title="orkut_smart_mobile" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/08/orkut_smart_mobile.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="320" />][1]Few months back in April, [Orkut launched mobile version][2] of their social network at <a href="http://m.orkut.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.orkut.com', 'http://m.orkut.com']);" >http://m.orkut.com</a>.

Now <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2008/08/orkut-for-s60-now-with-photo-uploads.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2008/08/orkut-for-s60-now-with-photo-uploads.html', 'they']);" >they</a> <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/08/orkut-for-s60-now-with-photo-uploads.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/08/orkut-for-s60-now-with-photo-uploads.html', 'have']);" >have</a> upgraded their mobile site with some nice features like photo uploading, click-to-call, better friend search, etc.

Good thing is, to use this new site you no need to download nay special mobile software or remember new address. Just go to old mobile site at <a href="http://m.orkut.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.orkut.com', 'http://m.orkut.com']);" >http://m.orkut.com</a> from your Symbian Series 60 (3rd Edition) handsets browser and you will be served with this new feature rich version.

You can check <a href="http://www.s60.com/life/s60phones/browseDevices.do" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.s60.com/life/s60phones/browseDevices.do', 'here']);" >here</a>, which handsets are Symbian Series 60 (3rd Edition).

Hopefully orkut will expand this to other handsets. I think they could do better by creating a java client as it exists for Gmail. That way they could have cover wider user-base.

Enjoy new orkut&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
