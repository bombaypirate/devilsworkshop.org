Just had a glimpse of one of the most awaited feature on Orkut, THE Google Talk Integration! It looks like I am the last one to see it on my orkut account! ðŸ˜‰

After many Greasemonkey scripts, [orkut apps][1] and other hacks, nothing seems to beat this official integration.

More than 2 years ago, we [posted][2] about this much needed integration. But after a bold move from rival [Facebook to offer chat feature][3], this was quite expected from Orkut.

Integration looks nice but with some open questionsâ€¦

  * Whether Orkut will show list of online Orkut friends like Facebook? List of Orkut friends can differ from list of Google Talk friends.
  * In any case, list of online friends is good option. I could not see it anywhere. May be I failed to notice it.
  * I am not sure if all Orkut users can use this feature. It looks like one need to be user of Google Talk separately to enjoy this feature.
  * It is not clear whether you can chat with online Orkut friends from your existing Google Talk clients.

Lets hope like many other features this feature will be improved with time.
