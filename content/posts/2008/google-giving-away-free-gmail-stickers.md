  Google is again in with a <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/get-your-gmail-stickers.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/get-your-gmail-stickers.html', 'good news']);" target="_blank">good news</a> for all Gmail lovers. All Gmail fans there can collect your free Gmail stickers just by sending a self addressed-stamped envelope to the address mentioned on the bottom of this post. The best part is that, you will get not only the &#8216;Gmail logo&#8217; stickers, but also a sticky list of Gmail shortcuts which you can paste somewhere behind your keyboard and get familiar with its shortcuts. ðŸ˜‰

  I am big fan of &#8216;Gmail&#8217; and desperately in need of those stickers, but the sad part is that I am not aware about how to send those self addressed envelopes to a foreign country. If any one in India have ever sent such self addressed envelopes, please let me know the procedure in detail. Your help to me will be highly obliged. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
