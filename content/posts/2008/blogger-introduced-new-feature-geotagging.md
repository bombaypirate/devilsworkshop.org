Blogger (Also called <a href="http://www.blogspot.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blogspot.com', 'blogspot']);" target="_blank">blogspot</a>) in <a href="http://draft.blogger.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://draft.blogger.com', 'draft']);" target="_blank">draft</a> has recently announced a new feature called Geotagging or location labels which enables you to add locations to each of your post through Google Maps. It is similar to time stamps of blogger posts which help to browse using specific date/month whereas Geotag give your readers a way to browse posts near a specific location.

As per official blog of Blogger in draft

> We’ve just added geotagging to the new post editor on Blogger in draft. With geotagging, you can add a location to your each of your blog posts. Just as time stamps help readers find posts from a certain date or time, geotags give your readers a way to browse posts near a specific location.

Adding a geotag to your post is easy. Log into draft.blogger.com, open the post editor, and click the &#8216;add location&#8217; link below the main text field.

Use the location editor to search, drag, click and zoom on a map to choose and save a location. Google says- &#8220;We’ll try to label the location you choose using our reverse geocoder, which looks up a name for a point on the map&#8221;. You can also edit the location name by clicking the blue location name text below the search field.

As said earlier, you can see clearly, this feature is integrated with Google Maps:
