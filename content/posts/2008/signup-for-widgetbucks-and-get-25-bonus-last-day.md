<img style="border-top-width: 0pt; display: inline; border-left-width: 0pt; border-bottom-width: 0pt; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right-width: 0pt" alt="Earn $$ with WidgetBucks!" src="http://images.widgetbucks.com/images/referral/Ads-suck-01b.gif" align="left" /> WidgetBucks is one of the very few ad networks I have been using successfully from long time. Of course, it doesnâ€™t help me earn money like Google AdSense but it is a good choice if you just have some free ad-space on your blog/website.

To celebrate their first anniversary, they have re-introduced $25 signup bonus offer they had during first three months. You will receive **$25 bonus when your earnings will reach $50**. 

WidgetBucks ads are mix of CPM and CPA which means you will get paid for sure for ad-impressions your blog will serve. If you are from US then their newly introduced travel and local widget ads will work for sure. If you are running a product-review blog then you can put customized widgets listing related products as well.

Personally, I use merchsense type of widgets where they(WidgetBucks) automatically crawl this blog and serve relevant ads. Also these ads blend good with rest of the blog so it wonâ€™t degrade user experience at all.

There are just really many options too choose from that you will find success with WidgetBucks for sure. ðŸ˜‰

Apart form this they have relatively good referral program which is the reason I am posting this! ðŸ˜€

So hurry up to join WidgetBuck as this $25 bonus offer is valid till tomorrow only. You can explore it later!

**Personal Note:** Many of you have noticed, I was away from this blog for more than a week. I was stuck with some personal problems which are almost fixed now. I appreciate all of you who have contacted me and showed concern. Please bear with such posting delays for another week. In meantime, guest authors and co-bloggers can contact Deepak Jain, as he is new and first editor at Devils Workshop. I will resume frequent blogging in a week or two and very soon Devils Workshop will be hiring too! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
