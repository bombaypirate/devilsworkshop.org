  Before saying anything, I will just ask you to have a look on the image below. Only with a single glimpse on this image you will understand, how random and automated ads can be harmful at times.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img class="wp-image-50478" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="521" alt="mumbai.png" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/11/mumbaipng.jpg" width="504" border="0" />
</p>

  The Google ad on the image reads: "Terrorism: Pursue a certificate in terrorism 100% online. Enroll today."
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The ad was spotted on a Mumbai attack story on <strong><a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ibnlive.in.com/', 'IBNLive website']);" >IBNLive website</a></strong>, which asks visitors to enroll for an online course on terrorism. Atleast at this point of time, this ad may be the most offensive one Google ever showed off. On one hand the nation is fighting stiffly against terrorism, on the other hand, by showing such ads, Google is encouraging people to pursue and get excellence in the field of terrorism. Though it may be a case of coincidence, is such a blunder expected from Google??
