You must have noticed that **Orkut disabled Right-Clicking** on photos in others albums recently. I guess their motive was to disallow people from saving personal photos from others albums. I feel what they have done now is quite unnecessary, considering the fact that Orkut is already giving every user the option of locking albums and restricting the access to a particular set of friends only.  
There will be a lot more people who will upload photos of parties and get together on their Orkut Albums and ask their friends to take a copy from there. But now that they have disabled Right-Clicking, let’s check out what are the other possible ways to save photos from albums:  
1)The first method any Internet User will think of is taking screenshots and cropping using simple software like <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.irfanview.com/', 'IrfanView']);" >IrfanView</a>. It’s a convenient method if you want to save only a couple of photos.  
2)But, if you want to save the photos from an entire album, it’s becomes a tedious job to take screenshots and crop it every single time. The best alternative is to:

  * Click on the Photo.
  * Drag the Photo to the URL of your browser and Drop.
  * **Bingo!** The link location is displayed and the photo is displayed in full length in the body which Right-Click Enabled!
  * Now, you can Right-Click and click *“**Save Image As&#8221;** *to save it to your drive.
