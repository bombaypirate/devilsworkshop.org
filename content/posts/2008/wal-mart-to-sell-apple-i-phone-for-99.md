Though there are no official news about it, this rumor will surely remind you of Steve Jobs&#8217; statement, where he disclosed his willingness to bring down I-phone&#8217;s price to the lowest in the market. Even I am not sure whether there is any such deal between Apple and Wal-mart, but I think, an I phone for just $99 would be really worthy for every mobile phone users.

Also, there are possibilities that it may be a news leaked prior to its announcement. Apple may decide to bring this offer keeping in mind, the launch of so called <a href="http://www.iphonekiller.com/2008/12/02/the-new-iphone-killer-from-nokia/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.iphonekiller.com/2008/12/02/the-new-iphone-killer-from-nokia/', 'I-phone killer']);" target="_blank">I-phone killer</a> handset Nokia N97. Well, I am pondering that, even if Apple comes up with any such deal will that $99 offer ever come to India?
