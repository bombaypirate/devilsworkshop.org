Starting from this week, I am trying a new experiment &#8211; Series writing.

Series writing is proven effective for many top bloggers. It demands much more consistency than normal blogging but I have more reasons to try this. In last few weeks, I have noticed that I blog about too many topics here. As a consequence, I waste a lot of time deciding what topic to write on.

Personally, I am into many things like blogging, web design, wordpress development, site administration, computer security, SEO, freelancing, etc. So it was always harder for me to choose a niche. So I have decided to take one topic at a time exclusively to blog about.

Of course, I will keep you updated on Orkut, iPhone and other my favorite topics which I closely monitor over the Internet. Series writing doesn&#8217;t mean you just blog on one topic. It just means you blog **more** on a particular topic.

This week I will be posting more on WordPress plugins. This series is intended to help new wordpress bloggers gain most from from countless wordpress plugins.

In my first series, I will post about plugin usability, my favorite wordpress plugins and similar things which can help you as a wordpress user.

If all goes well, I will also write a wordpress plugin series for developers. Yes, I am into commercial wordpress development and I just got paid $300 for my first private wordpress plugin.

Next I have really great series almost complete on Google Adsense but I will put it live in September once AdSense for product referral retires. I am also planning to cover series on online money-making, SEO, security, etc.

Please let me know if you like to read more about a particular topic. I hope you will enjoy this new experiment.

First post will be live in few hours. Thank you all&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
