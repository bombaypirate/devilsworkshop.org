Have you been asked to create a new account, whenever you try to log into Orkut?

And you are like what the hell I have an account in orkut, my friends can see my profile. But I can&#8217;t log-in **WHATS GOING ON!!!**

Don&#8217;t worry guys you are not the only one who is facing this issue, there are many other Orkut user&#8217;s who are facing the same issue. This is a new bug in Orkut and is confirmed by folks at official <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/orkut-system-alerts/browse_thread/thread/30ec5455477e7e76" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/orkut-system-alerts/browse_thread/thread/30ec5455477e7e76', 'Orkut Help center']);" >Orkut Help center</a>.

**The only things it does:**Â Asks you to create a new account, even if you have an existing Orkut account! Strange thing is, this bug exactly force you to violate Orkut ToS, which prohibits creating multiple accounts on Orkut. Its different [story][1] that Orkut Buyukkokten, creator of Orkut, himself have [multiple profiles on Orkut][1]! ðŸ˜‰

**But the good news is:**  
This issue has been taken up for fix by the Orkut team and lets hope for solution soon. They have solved most of multiple profile issues.
