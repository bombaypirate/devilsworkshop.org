Orkut introduced [album privacy feature][1] few months back by which one could choose who can see their photos. Then they added support for [uploading 10000 photos][2] and a new level of privacy feature was needed as many users uploaded lots of albums but not all albums are equally personals.

Thanks to orkut&#8217;s new album privacy feature you can set privacy differently for each album from your <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/AlbumList.aspx?uid=2008781293621471903" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/AlbumList.aspx?uid=2008781293621471903', 'orkut photos page']);" >orkut photos page</a> as shown below&#8230;
