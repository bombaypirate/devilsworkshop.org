Contact page is something every serious blogger must add on their blog.

Many bloggers just create a contact page or worse put their email id somewhere in sidebar. Reason to do this includes spam problem, laziness, not enough technical knowledge, etc.

There are many sites and plugins available to do this easily. One such plugin we are using at Devils Workshop is <a href="http://www.bloggingexpertise.com/plugins/wp-contactform-akismet/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloggingexpertise.com/plugins/wp-contactform-akismet/', 'WP-ContactForm: Akismet Edition']);" >WP-ContactForm: Akismet Edition</a> plugin. Those who know about akismet might have already guessed that this plugin takes care of all spam automatically.

Although the developer of this plugin mentioned some issues with wordpress 2.5, its working here as smoothly as it used to work on earlier wordpress versions.

**Now all self-hosted WordPress bloggers can follow steps below&#8230;**

  1. Install and activate plugin. *(<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins', 'How ??']);" >How ??</a>)*
  2. Once you activated this plugin, go to **Write >> page**.
  3. In editor, put contact, feedback or whatever you like in Title field.
  4. Then switch to HTML view. WriteÂ  **`<!--contact form-->` **as it is there. You may write anything before and after it.
  5. That it! Just publish the page and you are done.

**Here is screenshot of editor**

For more advance options, Go to **Settings >> Contact Form** options. You can check our [contact page][2] right now!

Note that this plugin needs <a href="http://akismet.com/download/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://akismet.com/download/', 'Akismet']);" >Akismet</a> pre-activated for the spam-filtering to work. Otherwise, all messages will be sent straight to you, unchecked!
