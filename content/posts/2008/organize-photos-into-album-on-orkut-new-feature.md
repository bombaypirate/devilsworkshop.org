After revising photo upload limits to 100 next thing everyone wanted is a way to manage photos nicely! Orkut answered your call and now you can group your photos into different albums like my vacation album, new year party pics, birthday snaps, &#8230;

So when you click photos link now you will see following&#8230;

[<img class="wp-image-54395" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="142" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/01/image-thumb.png" width="435" border="0" />][1]

&#160;

Just choose a title and description, your album will be ready. Next you will be taken to screen where you can upload pics into it! Uploading is the same old process. I was expecting a java applet like facebook provides.

Final album will look like this&#8230;

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="262" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/01/image-thumb1.png" width="435" border="0" />][2]

After creating a album things you can customize anytime are

  * Album cover 
  * Name of album i.e. title 
  * Album description 
  * Of course photos inside album! 

One feature orkut should have given is to move photos between album. As of now if you have uploaded lots of photos on orkut on different topics, you **can not move** them just into different albums. You have to download them first to hard drive, then upload them again different album!

Anyway something nice from orkut after their [scrapbook][3] and [album hacks][4]!
