Spokeo is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_aggregation" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_aggregation', 'social network aggregator']);" >social network aggregator</a> that automatically brings your friends&#8217; updates across various web services. It supports 40+ services including Blogger, Digg, Flickr, Fotolog, Hi5, LinkedIn, MySpace, Picasa, Slide, Twitter, Veoh, Xanga, Yahoo! Videos, YouTube.

In addition to supporting social networks, Spokeo is a full feed reader, able to track any blog or website that has RSS feed.

**Finding Friends: **There are 3 ways to find and add friends into Spokeo.

  * Find friend by email or URL 
  * Import friends by address book 
  * Import friends by social network 

**Misconception:** Spokeo is not a social network as many people think. It does not support messaging, blogging, photo or video uploading, or any social network features. Moreover, it syndicates only publicly available information. So Facebook* (except notes & shares)* & Orkut like sites can not be supported.

Overall I like the concept but hated few things like 1000 contact limit and slow speed. Still worth giving a try!
