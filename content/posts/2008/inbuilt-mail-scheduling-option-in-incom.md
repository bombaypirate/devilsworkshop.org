But if you think, its too complicated to send scheduled mails at a future date using LetterMeLater, than &#8216;In.Com&#8217; has a better service for you inbuilt in it called "Future Mails". Yes, among many other innovation, this is another one from the so called "India&#8217;s shortest mail id provider". Since its launch a couple of months ago, In.com has managed to get a huge amout of viewers. Also, recently, as a promotional initiative, all the websites of IBN network were moved to in.com&#8217;s domain.

As you can see on the scree shot, while composing your mail at In.com, you just need to click the tab &#8211; "Send as future mail" and you will get a window popped up where in you&#8217;ll be asked your desired date of delivery. After selecting your desired date and time, hit &#8216;Send&#8217; and you are done. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  We would advice, if you want to prevent from the lengthy procedure of using <a href="http://www.devilsworkshop.org/schedule-your-outgoing-e-mails-to-be-sent-later/">LetterMeLater</a>, better <a href="http://www.in.com/mails/new_reg.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.in.com/mails/new_reg.php', 'open']);" >open</a> an account at In.com and start scheduling greetings and birthday wishes. ðŸ˜‰
