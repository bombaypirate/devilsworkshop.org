Like everyone else, team Orkut is all set to squeeze maximum juice out of this holiday season! Just logged on orkut to see following messageâ€¦

[<img class="wp-image-51153" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="51" alt="Feeling jolly? Get into the holiday spirit with these special treats on orkut!" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/image-thumb8.png" width="548" border="0" />][1]&#160;

[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin-left: 0px;border-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="134" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/image-thumb9.png" width="162" align="right" border="0" />][2] When you click on it, it takes you to a page where Orkut recommends (read promotes) some of its feature and applications which you can use this holiday season. 

Apart from albums and videos, the other feature orkut is promoting with maximum efforts is their newly launched [events feature][3].

Three holiday applications they have listed are <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#AppInfo.aspx?appUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fbuddypoke.s3.amazonaws.com%2Forkut.xml&objs=&sn=&ref=MP" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/Main#AppInfo.aspx?appUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fbuddypoke.s3.amazonaws.com%2Forkut.xml&objs=&sn=&ref=MP', 'BuddyPoke']);" >BuddyPoke</a>, <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#AppInfo.aspx?appUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.studiosol.com.br%2FminhaMusica.xml&objs=&sn=&ref=MP" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/Main#AppInfo.aspx?appUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.studiosol.com.br%2FminhaMusica.xml&objs=&sn=&ref=MP', 'My Music']);" >My Music</a> and <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#AppInfo.aspx?appUrl=http%3A//natal.gartic.com.br/app.xml&objs=&sn=&ref=MP" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/Main#AppInfo.aspx?appUrl=http%3A//natal.gartic.com.br/app.xml&objs=&sn=&ref=MP', 'Christmas Tree']);" >Christmas Tree</a>.

Also, we can expect different homepage designs on Xmas and New Year. If you like [themes on Orkut][4], keep an eye on themes tab as special holiday theme will appear anytime!
