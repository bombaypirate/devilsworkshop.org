In my last visit to one of my favorite blog, <a href="http://www.labnol.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/', 'Digital Inspiration']);" >Digital Inspiration</a>, I came across an unusual Google Adsense Ad. At first I though it might be some mistake, but I checked many pages and found same ad format all over the pages.

Curiously I went to, <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/AdFormats.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/AdFormats.html', 'Google Adsense Ad format page']);" >Google Adsense Ad format page</a> to check if any new format has arrived but I failed to find anything near to following ad running on Digital Inspiration. 

[<img class="wp-image-54518" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="132" alt="Google Adsense Premium Ad Format" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/05/image-thumb14.png" width="484" border="0" />][1] 

Its dimension is around 480&#215;128. Curious enough, I opened <a href="http://www.labnol.org/forums/topic/which-google-adsense-ad-format-is-being-used-here" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/forums/topic/which-google-adsense-ad-format-is-being-used-here', 'a new topic on DI forum']);" >a new topic on DI forum</a>. And as I suspected, Amit answered saying, *"its a premium ad format"*. Yes Google Adsense do have premium membership limited to few websites which receive more than 5 million search queries, or 20 million content page views per month.

Coincidentally, I read about <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/04/privilege-of-being-adsense-premium.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/04/privilege-of-being-adsense-premium.html', 'Adsense premium publishers']);" >Adsense premium publishers</a> on Digital Inspiration only. Here is list of some perks which premium members get. More details are <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/04/privilege-of-being-adsense-premium.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/04/privilege-of-being-adsense-premium.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.

  * Size, color, fonts of Ad-unit are all configurable. This means you can create ad which suits best for your site.
  * Option to remove **"Ads by Google"** text shown around ads.
  * Creating direct links to Adsense for search results. Sort of having text-links!
  * Dedicated Adsense account manager to help you optimize and answer your all Adsense query. Of course his salary will be paid by Google. ðŸ˜‰
  * They can negotiate revenue share/percentage with Google.
  * Ads are allowed on adult-content, gambling related sites. Hmm so Google ***do evil*** when it comes to big bucks! ðŸ˜‰

Only thing still surprising me is, why Amit did not post about his new success on DI. May be he don&#8217;t want to get undue attention, specially from income-tax guys! ðŸ˜‰
