Vodafone is launching iPhone in India from August 22, 2008 with 8GB & 16GB models, priced at Rs. 31,000 and Rs. 36,100 respectively.

Vodafones rival, [Airtel is also launching iPhone on 22 August][2] probably at the same price.

This is much higher than what I have expected. Also as these prices are clearly targeting very rich consumer section, these iPhones may come altogether with different plan with higher call rates / GPRS charges.

But I am still hopeful that prices will drop significantly once telecom companies make enough profits from first wave of iPhone customers. So I will surely wait for atleast 2 months before buying iPhone.

If you happen to buy it, please mail me your picture with your iPhone at rahul@devilsworkshop.org. I am planning to create gallery of our proud&#160; iPhone owners.
