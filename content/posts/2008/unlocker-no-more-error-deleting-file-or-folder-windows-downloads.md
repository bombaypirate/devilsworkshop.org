If you are Windows user then you might have seen something like below in past:

[<img class="wp-image-53164" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="128" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/image-thumb11.png" width="408" border="0" />][1] 

There are other similar error alerts like&#8230;

  * Cannot delete file: Access is denied 
  * The source or destination file may be in use. 
  * The file is in use by another program or user. 
  * Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use. 
  * etc&#8230; 

Most of the times files/folders are locked by some applications you may not know. So even closing application in doubt doesn&#8217;t solves problem.

I often get this error so was wondering if there any way to **unlock** the file/folder I want to move/delete. Thanks to Google, I found this nice application named **Unlocker**&#8230;

**#How-To Use**

0. Click here to <a href="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/unlocker1.8.5.exe" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/unlocker1.8.5.exe', 'download Unlocker']);" >download Unlocker</a>&#160;*(size: 190KB)*. Setup is simple and quick. After installing&#8230;

1. Just right click on file/folder and select Unlocker from context menu as shown in following screenshot&#8230;

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;border-right-width: 0px" height="218" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/image-thumb12.png" width="235" border="0" />][2] 

2. A window with list of applications having lock on file/folder will appear

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;border-right-width: 0px" height="176" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/image-thumb13.png" width="480" border="0" />][3] 

3. Select **Unlock All**&#160; or any other option. Its your choice!
