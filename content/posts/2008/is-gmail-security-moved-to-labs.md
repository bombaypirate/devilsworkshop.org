  <img class="wp-image-50480" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 10px 0px 0px 5px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="167" alt="gmail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/11/gmail.png" width="265" align="right" border="0" /> Google has a tendency of launching new services with &#8216;labs&#8217; tag on it which are unreliable and incomplete and may have some loopholes, bugs and security flaws. So, there would be a big question mark onto <strong>whether the Gmail security too moving towards labs? </strong>If you remember, earlier this month we <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/domain-hijacking-menace-is-still-on-flaws-in-gmail/">mentioned</a> how <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.makeuseof.com', 'MakeUseOf']);" >MakeUseOf</a> domain was hacked and the doubt behind the whole hacking, though not sure about it, was due to some flaws in Gmail. But recently, MakeUseOf website <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/breaking-gmail-security-flaw-more-domains-get-stollen/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/breaking-gmail-security-flaw-more-domains-get-stollen/', 'confirmed']);" >confirmed</a> that, there are surely flaws in Gmail itself, as a result many more domains get stolen. According to them, this month alone, atleast 3-4 domains were hacked and all were some how related with Gmail. Before this post in <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.makeuseof.com', 'MakeUseOf.com']);" >MakeUseOf.com</a>, Blogoscoped <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-11-23-n74.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-11-23-n74.html', 'mentioned']);" >mentioned</a> how malicious filters could be set on your Gmail account to forward a set of mails to another id. Also, Bradon at Geekcondition <a href="http://geekcondition.com/2008/11/23/gmail-security-flaw-proof-of-concept/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://geekcondition.com/2008/11/23/gmail-security-flaw-proof-of-concept/', 'explains']);" >explains</a> how it is possible. According to him, by directing you to some external links one can force you to create filters in your inbox, importantly without your knowledge.

  But a recent post in Google security blog, <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html', 'claims']);" >claims</a> that there are no such flaws in Gmail rather those are just a case of phising activity. The targeted users are directed towards an external link to hack their login information and no filters&#160; can be set by them. To prevent you from any such menace Google has put an <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/how-to-avoid-getting-hooked.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/how-to-avoid-getting-hooked.html', 'advisory']);" >advisory</a> on their blog, also they say:

>   To keep your Google account secure online, we recommend you only ever enter your Gmail sign-in credentials to web addresses starting with https://www.google.com/accounts, and never click-through any warnings your browser may raise about certificates.

  But still there is a big question as to whether the statement by <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/breaking-gmail-security-flaw-more-domains-get-stollen/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/breaking-gmail-security-flaw-more-domains-get-stollen/', 'MakeUseOf']);" >MakeUseOf</a> and <a href="http://geekcondition.com/2008/11/23/gmail-security-flaw-proof-of-concept/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://geekcondition.com/2008/11/23/gmail-security-flaw-proof-of-concept/', 'Bradon']);" >Bradon</a> is correct or the one given by <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html', 'Google']);" >Google</a> is correct. <strong>What do you think..? Is Gmail security moved to labs</strong>??
