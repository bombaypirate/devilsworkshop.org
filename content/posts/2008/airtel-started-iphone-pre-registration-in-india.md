After [Vodafone iPhone Pre-registration campaign][1], Airtel also joined the party by starting their own online booking for iPhone.

If you are Airtel subscriber and don&#8217;t want to switch to Vodafone for iPhone then you may register for iPhone with Airtel. I have registered with both operators to make sure that I get iPhone as early as possible.

Airtel unlike Vodafone provides online registration facility only. To register head over to Airtel-iPhone registration page.
