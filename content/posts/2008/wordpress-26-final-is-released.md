A month ahead of its schedule, WordPress 2.6 is released now. You can download it from <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/download/', 'wordpress.org']);" >wordpress.org</a>.

Below are key-features which I will be exploring today…

  * Post Revisions: Wiki-like tracking of edits. Good for multi-author blogs.
  * Press This bookmarklet for quick posting from anywhere on the web
  * [Shift Gears: Faster Admin panel][1]
  * Theme Previews: Good for theme developers
  * Word count display below Save and Publish buttons
  * Ability to change the location of the wp-config.php file for better security.
  * Multiple plugin activate/deactivate at once
  * Improved galleries with drag-and-drop sorting

Coincidentally Theme Preview feature is arriving at the time when I am in the middle of developing a new theme for this blog.

Anyway will post more about it once I use this new version. In meantime, enjoy video tour…
