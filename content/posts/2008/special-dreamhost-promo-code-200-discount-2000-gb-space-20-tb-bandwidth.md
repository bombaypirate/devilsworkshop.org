The offer includes **upto** **$200** in discount plus **Four** **times** more space and bandwidth.

### What Makes This Offer Special

**Four Time Space And Bandwidth&#8230;**

Dreamhost normally offers 500GB disk space and 5TB/month bandwidth. But if you use any of below 5 promo-code then you will get 2000GB space and 20TB/month bandwidth on your account. Moreover like normal dreamhost accounts space will be increased by 2 GB and bandwidth will be increased by 40 GB per week automatically! Click <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html', 'here']);" >here</a> for complete list of features!

**$200 and $150 Special Discount&#8230;**

On 5 year pre-payment you can get $150 discount and on 10 year plan its $200. So after going through latest price and discounts, you have to pay **only** **$267** for **5 year** OR **$514** for **10 years**!

**Does it seem costly?**

Lets do some simple math. For 5 year plan you have to pay $267. Thats **$53.4/year** or **$4.45/month**! Now worst blog or site on net can easily make $5 per month from advertising programs like Google Adsense and [Kontera][1].

Now considering dreamhosts unlimited number of email/database/website/user accounts feature, you can sign-up for this huge package in group to bring cost further below. ðŸ˜‰

### Codes are not working&#8230;?

### <span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">First check if you have right promo code from above list. Its random and 12-digit number unlike</span> <span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 19px;">DW50</span> <span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">which is easy to remember.</span>

Next note that this offer is only for new customers. Also a personal advice that don&#8217;t try to create a new account if you are already a Dreamhost customer. It is not allowed as per Dreamhosts terms of service.

If none of above works then you may missed this golden chance. You can still use normal dreamhost promo code **DW50** for **$50** discount on any plan over there&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
