Clipmarks is <span style="line-height: normal;">available as extension for Firefox and Internet Explorer, which <span style="line-height: 19px;">lets you capture the specific content on a web page, instead of linking to entire web pages. This is good way of sharing as very often we want to share a small part of a large web page.</span></span>

There are lots of things you can do with your clips:

  * **Save them on Clipmarks.com:** Your clips can be saved publicly to share with others, or you can make them private. Either way you&#8217;ve got a fully searchable collection of great things you find on the web.
  * **Post them directly to your blog:** Clipmarks offers direct integration with wordpress, blogger, typepad, live journal and other blogging platforms, enabling you to post anything you clip from a web page directly to your blog. (<a href="http://clipmarks.com/clip-to-blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://clipmarks.com/clip-to-blog/', 'View Demo']);" >View Demo</a>)
  * **Email them to friends:** Straight from any web page you can clip and email something you want friends, family or co-workers to see. (<a href="http://clipmarks.com/clip-to-email/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://clipmarks.com/clip-to-email/', 'View Demo']);" >View Demo</a>)
  * **Print them:** Don&#8217;t waste paper or get annoyed trying to copy and paste to a Word document. Use clipmarks to easily print only the parts of the page you want.
