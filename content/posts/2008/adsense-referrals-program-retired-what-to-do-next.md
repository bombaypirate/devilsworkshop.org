<span style="line-height: 19px"><br /> <img class="wp-image-52647" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/08/fullscreen.jpg" width="210" height="123" alt="Fullscreen.jpg" style="float:right" />Just noticed on my blog that AdSense referrals units are showing blank space. As Google announced earlier about AdSense referral program&#8217;s retirement, this came as no surprise.</span>

Speaking for this blog specifically, apart from Firefox referral, AdSense referral program never worked well. I joined Google&#8217;s alternative affiliate network form some time, but yet to test its performance. I tested few affiliate networks in past and will most probably use <span style="line-height: normal"><span style="line-height: 19px"><a href="http://www.pjatr.com/t/2-5920-10096-9018" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pjatr.com/t/2-5920-10096-9018', 'PepperJam']);" >PepperJam</a> and <a href="http://chitika.com/mm_overview.php?refid=rahul286" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chitika.com/mm_overview.php?refid=rahul286', 'Chitika']);" >Chitika</a> soon.</span></span>

Firefox referrals used to make 10% of all my AdSense earnings and it would have been great (atleast for me) if Google continued to promote Firefox. But it seems that Google got enough toolbars all over the web!

Anyway as a blogger first thing you should do now is to remove all AdSense referral codes from your blog. You may still see some referral earnings till September end in your AdSense account as explained in earlier post.

If you have any alternative referral program for firefox or in-general please let us know. For time being, I have switched to non-profit <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&id=199011" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&id=199011', 'Spread Firefox community']);" >Spread Firefox community</a> for firefox promotion.
