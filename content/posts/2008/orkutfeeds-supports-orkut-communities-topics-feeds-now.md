If you missed about our latest [OrkutFeeds project][1] then we launched it a week ago for orkut scrapbook feeds.

With nice response and many requests specially from our readers in Brazil, support for Orkut Communities & Topics feed has been deployed today! A week earlier from planned schedule.

**Now you have in total 3 options&#8230;**

  * Subscribe to orkut scrapbook feed
  * Subscribe to orkut community feed
  * Subscribe to any particular topic feed from a orkut community

**Also following things has been updated&#8230;.**

  * Subscription form on OrkutFeeds homepage now accept any valid URL from Orkut. You can just copy-n-paste any Orkut URL now and we will server you relevant feeds! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * GreaseMonkey Script (<a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/11069.user.js" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/11069.user.js', 'Install Link']);" >Install Link</a>) also changed so that it will show subscription links whenever you visit any Orkut page that can be subscribed!
