Just checked my AdSense account and delighted to see AdSense for Feeds enabled on it.

But putting AdSense ads in feed will take time for me. Although Google brought FeedBurner, there is no automatic way to integrate AdSense and Feedburner. This has to be done manually by AdSense support team. I mailed them as per official help instruction page.

Like AdSense for Content, ads in feed are also contextual in nature. So I am expecting nice revenue from this AdSense for Feeds program. I guess this will offset my 10% AdSense revenue loss due to [retirement of Adsense referral for products program][1].

I think bloggers with full text feeds will get more benefit as their posts will have more text to target.

If you use FeedBurner with MyBrand option, then you may face some problem. <a href="http://www.labnol.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/', 'Amit Agarwal']);" >Amit Agarwal</a> already posted <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/blogging/cname-for-feedburner-feeds-hosted-on-google/4132/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/internet/blogging/cname-for-feedburner-feeds-hosted-on-google/4132/', 'workaround for this']);" >workaround for this</a>.
