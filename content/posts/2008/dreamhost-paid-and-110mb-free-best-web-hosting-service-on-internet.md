In this post I am writing about a free and a paid web hosting service. They are best in their own categories.

Also, as computer hardware is getting cheaper everyday just disk space and bandwidth should not be your parameters for choosing the right webhost. Of course, paid webhosts will anytime offer you much more disk space, bandwidth & other features.

&#160;

### <a href="http://www.110mb.com/aff.php?un=rahul286" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.110mb.com/aff.php?un=rahul286', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-52183" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px;border-right-width: 0px" height="88" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/03/image18.png" width="204" align="right" border="0" /></a>110MB &#8211; Best Free Web Hosting Service

I used it for more than a year. I still maintain <a href="http://rahul286.110mb.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rahul286.110mb.com/', 'my account']);" >my account</a> there.

**Here are few things to notice:**

  * No Ads. Not even text-links! In fact I am there for more than a year and still its ad-free. 
  * Nice support which is rare with free webhosts. 
  * You will be offered a subdomain. You can register one domain with extra cost! I guess that&#8217;s fair too. 
  * An affiliate program to give more traffic to your site. 
  * Nice uptime. Ever better than some paid hosts out there! 

**Features &#8211; just for sake of mentioning&#8230;**

  * Disk Space &#8211; 5 GB 
  * Bandwidth &#8211; 300 GB per month 
  * PHP, MySQL, One-Click Installer, etc.. 
  * <a href="http://www.110mb.com/plans.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.110mb.com/plans.php', 'Complete list is here']);" >Complete list is here</a> 

Also some function like sendmail and database support costs one time payment of around $5-$10. This small payment is nothing to consider as its just one time.

**Business Model&#8230; **

Yep. You should ask about it! As there are always catches with free things. Anyway don&#8217;t worry 110MB is exception.

  * They make money by showing ads in control/admin panel. Note that they show ad to you, not to your visitors! 
  * Showing ads on 404 error pages. Its ok for personal as well as small websites. 
  * Direct payments made for small upgrades. Like $5 to enable sendmail function.

### <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html', '']);" ><img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px;border-right-width: 0px" height="74" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/03/image19.png" width="208" align="right" border="0" /></a> Dreamhost &#8211; Best Paid Web Hosting Service

Yep. Dreamhost is the best webhost and that&#8217;s the reason we are using it! Its cheap price was never a catch for me personally as when searching for good paid webbost I was all concern about features and support. In fact I was not aware of promo codes so I missed $97 discount which I could avail that time <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Anyway my thinking was, *if you can afford $100 per year what&#8217;s the problem with $200 per year! *After all worst sites on internet with few hundred hits daily makes more than $200 per annum by using just Google Adsense!

**So here comes few things I loved about Dreamhost**

  * Really nice and fast support! 
  * All features are explained in details with examples at <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Main_Page" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Main_Page', 'Dreamhost wikis']);" >Dreamhost wikis</a>. This means anyone with little knowledge about web based technology can create websites. 
  * Nice <a href="http://discussion.dreamhost.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://discussion.dreamhost.com/', 'support forum']);" >support forum</a> with large number of active members. 
  * Affiliate Program to free your hosting bills. 

**Features &#8211; just for sake of mentioning&#8230;**

  * Storage: 500GB *(+2GB will be added every week)* 
  * Bandwidth: 5TB *(+40GB will be added every week)* 
  * Free 1-Domain registration. You can register more with any registrar. 
  * Unlimited MySQL databases, Web Sites, Email, FTP, User Accounts 
  * *<a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html', 'Complete list of features is here']);" >Complete list of features is here</a>* 

**How to get best DEAL&#8230;**

  * As Dreamhost supports unlimited user accounts you can share cost of hosting among your friends. We are hosting seven websites here as of now and more will be added soon&#8230; 
  * Paying for atleast one year. You can pay for 10 years in advance. 
  * Using Dreamhost promo codes you can get **$50** discount. Thats max you can get. Also if you use **DW50** as promo code you will get **$50** discount from DreamHost and **lifetime free telephonic support** by our highly experienced&#160; webmaster team. 
  * So just for calculation,&#160; if you are going for 10 years payment then $5.95/month x 12 month x 10 year &#8211; $50 discount = $664 for 10 years. **Thats $66.4 per annum!**
