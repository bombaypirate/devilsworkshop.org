MTNL has announced to launch 3G services tomorrow (11th December) on the presence of our Prime Minister &#8211; Dr. Manmohan Singh. Initially, the service would be made available only for the residents of Delhi and later on it would be expanded to Mumbai and other Indian cities, added a statement in <a href="http://infotech.indiatimes.com/News/MTNL_to_launch_3G_in_Delhi_on_Dec_11/articleshow/3797726.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://infotech.indiatimes.com/News/MTNL_to_launch_3G_in_Delhi_on_Dec_11/articleshow/3797726.cms', 'Times of India']);" target="_blank">Times of India</a>.

For those who don&#8217;t know what exactly 3G services is, it is the third generation services (also called 3G services) for mobile communication system that will enable a 3G compatible handset owner to stream live videos, make video calls and more, apart from being able to make traditional phone calls and use text messaging service. In a broader sense, 3G services enable a user to make faster data transfer of around 5-10 MBPS which is approximately 40 times greater than what 2G & 2.5G services claim to provide. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3g" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3g', 'wiki entry']);" target="_blank">wiki entry</a> for 3G says:

> 3G networks enable network operators to offer users a wider range of more advanced services while achieving greater network capacity through improved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_efficiency" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_efficiency', 'spectral efficiency']);" >spectral efficiency</a>. Services include wide-area wireless voice telephony, video calls, and broadband wireless data, all in a mobile environment.

Too much said and discussed about 3G services, all we require to do now is, just watch how successful and useful will 3G be in India and how much additional time will it take other private operators to roll out this modern services.
