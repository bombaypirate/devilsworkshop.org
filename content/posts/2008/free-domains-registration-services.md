I&#8217;m going to share some of my favorite free URL redirection services that provide free short URLs which look exactly like a paid domain name. There are many services that can convert a long URL into a shorter one like Tinyurl, <a href="http://bit.ly" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly', 'bit.ly']);" title="bit.ly">bit.ly</a>, etc but they are limited for single links. Three services listed below give you free domain names (actually subdomains) which you can use for your websites or blog hosted on free service like blogspot.com!

## #1 co.cc Domains

<a href="http://www.co.cc/?id=153234" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.co.cc/?id=153234', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-51605" src="http://www.co.cc/img/affiliates/cocc94_1.gif" border="0" alt="Free Domain" width="90" height="40" align="right" /></a><a href="http://www.co.cc/?id=153234" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.co.cc/?id=153234', 'co.cc']);" title="Co.cc Domains">co.cc</a> is one of my favorite free domain service since it is lot more than a URL shortener. Domain name formats they provide is like *www.yourdomain.co.cc. *You can register upto 2 domains with a single account. You will get full control over domain management. They provide DNS and MX services too. So, you can either use the regular URL forwarding or frame forwarding (doesn&#8217;t show ur original link in address bar) or you can use these DNS services and add CNAMEs in your domain. CNAME control means you can use Google apps and so you can have your own email id like *mail@yourdomain.co.cc* rather than the usual *yourname@gmail.com* or *yourname@yahoo.com*.

## #2 co.nr Domains

<a href="http://www.freedomain.co.nr/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freedomain.co.nr/', '']);" ><img src="http://mrszcma.4u.com.ru/soof62.gif" border="0" alt="Best Free Domains" width="88" height="31" align="right" /></a><a href="http://www.freedomain.co.nr/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freedomain.co.nr/', 'co.nr']);" >co.nr</a> is not so special as co.cc but are in the market for long. They provide free domain name in the form *www.yourdomain.co.nr* and it can be used for either URL redirection for another domain or any long web URL. They also support meta tags and provide favicon support. The only problem with this service is that we need to provide a link back to their site from our homepage or where we redirect this URL or else the service will be deactivated momentarily.

## #3 .tk Domains

<a href="http://freedomains.sriz.tk" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://freedomains.sriz.tk', '']);" ><img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/10/dot-tk.png" alt="dot.tk" width="99" height="51" align="right" /></a>

<a href="http://freedomains.sriz.tk" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://freedomains.sriz.tk', 'DOT.TK']);" title="Dot.tk Domains">DOT.TK</a> domains are also used for url forwarding i.e to convert any web URL into the form<a href="http://freedomains.sriz.tk" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://freedomains.sriz.tk', ' ']);" title="Dot.tk Domains"  target="_blank"> </a>*www.yourdomain.tk* . In addition to the normal URL forwarding they also provide mail forwarding where in we can choose upto 250 mail aliases to be forwarded to your mail account. For example, you can forward mail@yourdomain.tk or info@yourdomain.tk into your personal mail account. Earlier, they used to have a banner ad at the top of the window but now they have removed the ads completely which makes this service more attractive. The only problem now is all domain names that receive less than 25 hits per 90 days will be removed from your account.

There are a lot more free domain services but these are the only ones without any ads and they provide domains which are more or less similar to paid domains. I&#8217;Il write more on the other services in my next post. What are you waiting for?Â  Register your free domain now.
