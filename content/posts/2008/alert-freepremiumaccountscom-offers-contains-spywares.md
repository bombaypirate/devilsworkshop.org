<a href="http://www.freepremiumaccounts.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freepremiumaccounts.com/', 'Free Premium Accounts']);" target="_blank">Free Premium Accounts</a> is giving free Rapidshare & Megaupload premium accounts for referring people to their website. Since the website have no porn ads and not asking for your credit card information, it looks authentic. But there is a catch!

Apart from completing referrals, the site makes it mandatory to complete one or more offers. I just checked one such offer and it turn out to be installing spywares on my PC. Of course they didn’t say anything about spyware, but my anti-virus did!

So if you care about privacy and security, stay away from such free offer sites. Otherwise you are free to go ahead with <a href="http://freepremiumaccounts.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://freepremiumaccounts.com/', 'it']);" target="_blank">it</a>… <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Personally I prefer downloading via torrents as you can find much more files on torrents compared to rapidshare.

**Update (on October 1, 2009)**

Eric from <a href="http://www.freepremiumaccounts.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freepremiumaccounts.com/', 'Free Premium Accounts']);" target="_blank">Free Premium Accounts</a> contacted us claiming their softwares doesn&#8217;t contain any spyware. As last time I checked it, it was more than a year ago.

So if you are interested in this, you may try it on your risk. I suggest using [online antivirus scanner][1] to verify cleanliness of their software before installing it on your PC.
