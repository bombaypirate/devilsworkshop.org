After getting a lot of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-sms-channels?hl=en" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/google-sms-channels?hl=en', 'comments and advice']);" target="_blank">comments and advice</a> by its users, Google considered making some changes and improvements on their service, and I have listed some of &#8217;em here:

  * <div align="justify">
      The most disgusting & buggy thing in Google&#8217;s SMS channel was that, if you were new it, you had to send &#8216;ACCEPT&#8217; message in addition to channel joining message. This problem is now being solved. Infact, its a good news for channel owners &#8216;cos your subscriber need not bother about sending 2 individual messages now. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      When your friend accepts your invitation to join private channels, you will be notified about it via SMS.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Bug of unable to search for the channels created & subscribed by you has been fixed too.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Bug of unable to view too old posts has also been sorted out.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Channel owners can now customize whether their viewers will receive only headlines or full body contents. (Refer screenshot below).
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      More good channels added into "Editors pick" section.
    </div>

Though these improvements are appreciated and are too good, still there are more options needed in Google&#8217;s SMS channels. Some of my personal advice to them are listed here:

  * <div align="justify">
      As <a href="http://www.mytoday.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mytoday.com', 'Mytoday']);" target="_blank">Mytoday</a> provides for its mob users, an option to schedule messages and grant publishing rights to different people to publish new posts would really be great.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      In addition to 10 digit mobile number, there&#8217;s a need for a short code like 567678, 575757, etc. By this, the channel owner can create a good impression about his/her channel.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Better user interface to send customized SMS to a channel. Integrating Google SMS channels with Gtalk would be a great option.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      As advised by many other users, a private channel owner atleast should have the option to view his group subscribers.
    </div>

These are the only points I pointed out. If you readers too have any suggestion for them then comment form is here for you. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />   
May be some one from Google will drop in here and read out our suggestions. ðŸ˜‰
