One of most frequently asked question by Orkut users to me, is how to generate/create own custom orkut theme. By custom theme, they do not mean anything serious but just want to put their favorite actress&#8217; wallpaper as background on orkut!

Thanks to <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/', 'Gaurav Dua']);" >Gaurav Dua</a>, now any person can create such theme for orkut without any technical knowledge. Just head over to <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/toolkit/scripts/theme-generator.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/toolkit/scripts/theme-generator.php', 'Orkut theme generator page']);" >Orkut theme generator page</a> and paste link to your favorite online pic. I linked to my favorite <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27645379@N02/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/27645379@N02/', 'Devils workshop wallpaper']);" >Devils workshop wallpaper</a> created by <a href="http://www.funfilledblog.org/2008/06/14/happy-birthday-devils-workshop.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.funfilledblog.org/2008/06/14/happy-birthday-devils-workshop.htm', 'Johnson']);" >Johnson</a>. Next select a theme name and hit **&#8220;Create Theme&#8221;** button.

On next screen you will see link to your ready and hosted orkut theme.

This is basically a Greasemonkey script so you will need [Firefox][3] as well [Greasemonkey][4] extension to use this theme. Below is preview of <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/toolkit/scripts/DevilsWorkshop.user.js" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/toolkit/scripts/DevilsWorkshop.user.js', 'Devils Workshop theme']);" >Devils Workshop theme</a>.

Please note one thing that theme created like this can be seen only by you. These are unofficial themes and can not be seen by your friends. If you want to &#8220;show&#8221; you style to your friends, you have to limit your choice to [official Orkut themes][6] only.
