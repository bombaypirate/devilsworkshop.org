  This is a trick I personally use and I am sure, you too would like to give it a try after reading the whole article. Though I am using this trick for quite long time, but just now it hit my mind to let the world know about this trick.

  Well, you may have received some mails wherein the mail id on &#8216;To&#8217; field is that of the sender or some one else but not yours and you may be wondering how come you received the mail when the recipient id is not yours. So this is a quite simple trick that many of us use while sending group email. This is usually done so that others identity may not be disclosed. So let me come to the point and disclose the procedure to send undisclosed identity mails. ðŸ˜‰

  <strong>As usual compose an Email, on the &#8216;To&#8217; field either enter your own mail id or the one you can disclose to all recipients. Now enter all those ids that you want not to disclose on the &#8216;BCC&#8217; field</strong>. That&#8217;s it! You are done <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> By this, all will receive the mail but the addresses mentioned on the &#8216;BCC&#8217; field will not be visible to anyone except to the person entered on the &#8216;To&#8217; field.

  So, the next time while sending greetings to a group of people, do not forget to use this trick. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
