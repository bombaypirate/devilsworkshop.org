  <img class="wp-image-54442" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/11/mcafee-site-security.png" border="0" alt="McAfee site security" width="305" height="184" align="right" /> Just came across a cool site that claims to analyze the security of a given website. The homepage of <a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.siteadvisor.com/', 'McAfee site advisor']);" >McAfee site advisor</a> says:

>   We test the Web to help keep you safe from spyware, spam, viruses and online scams. Safety ratings from McAfee SiteAdvisor are based on automated safety tests of Web sites (including of our <a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/siteadvisor.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/siteadvisor.com/', 'own site']);" >own site</a>) and are enhanced by feedback from our volunteer reviewers and insights from our own analysts. McAfee SiteAdvisor does not accept payment from rated sites, so our ratings are objective and uniformly applied.

  After reading the above statement do we need to say anything else?<br /> Well, to test the service, we tried checking the safety of DevilsWorkshop and we passed the test. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> As you can see on the screen shot, it reads &#8220;We tested this site and didn&#8217;t find any significant problems.&#8221; Though most of us usually have anti-virus packs installed on our system, these kind of advisors can be used as a extra layer of safety. Also, McAfee site advisor comes with a firefox plugin for instant checking of a site reliability which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/download/ff_preinstall.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.siteadvisor.com/download/ff_preinstall.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.
