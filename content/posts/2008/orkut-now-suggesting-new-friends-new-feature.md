  During the mid of this year, Orkut launched a new feature wherein it was <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/orkut-now-recommending-communities-new-feature/">recommending users</a> to join communities that may be of their interest. Though the feature was not of much use, but after having a look on the community recommendation feature, Orkut users in the Orkut <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/orkut-help-profiles/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/orkut-help-profiles/', 'help group']);" target="_blank">help group</a> started demanding for a feature wherein their profile may list a couple of persons they may be knowing. And it is good to know that, it did not take Orkut too long to introduce what its users demanded. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  <img class="wp-image-51198" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="206" alt="Orkut_friend suggestion" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/orkut-friend-suggestion.png" width="570" border="0" />

  If you have ever used other famous social networking sites like <a href="http://www.hi5.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hi5.com', 'Hi5']);" target="_blank">Hi5</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com', 'Facebook']);" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, then by know you must have surely understood what exactly this feature is and what is the real funda behind it. Basically &#8216;friend suggestions&#8217; feature works by searching people who are more common to the network of friends in your existing friend list. The above displayed pane of &#8216;Friends suggestions by Orkut&#8217; can be viewed on your homepage just below the &#8216;Recent Visitors&#8217; area. If you are yet to see this feature on your profile, I guess it need not be mentioned that Orkut has a practice of rolling out new features phase wise. So, till then enjoy looking the above image. ðŸ˜‰ Though this feature too may not be of much use, but it seems Orkut is trying to bring all the features its competitors like <a href="http://www.hi5.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hi5.com', 'Hi5']);" target="_blank">Hi5</a> & <a href="http://www.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com', 'Facebook']);" target="_blank">Facebook</a> have, doesn&#8217;t matter how useful they are. Isn&#8217;t it?
