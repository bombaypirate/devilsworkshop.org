Now you must be wondering why I am reviewing another extension which sounds similar. Although sounds similar foxmarks is essential if you use bookmarking heavily.

There is a problem with Google browser syncs&#8217; bookmark synchronization. I have noticed that if I delete some bookmarks, they get added again from server in next synchronization. I have a temporary bookmark folder which I use for bookmarking articles which I want to read later. I keep cleaning such temporary bookmarks whenever their purpose get served.

Foxmarks clearly win battle here and records all changes to bookmarks without any error, so I depend heavily on it. Plus foxmarks give web-based access to all bookmarks. Even though Google have a bookmarking service, it doesn&#8217;t show bookmark synchronized via browser sync extension.

Also foxmarks offers some more features&#8230;

  * you can use own server to store bookmark if you concern about privacy
  * you can force overwrite either copy server or local
  * logging feature
  * sharing your bookmarks via feeds (available from web-based foxmarks)
