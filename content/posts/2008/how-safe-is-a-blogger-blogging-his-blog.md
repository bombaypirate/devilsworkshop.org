  Have you ever imagined, being a blogger, how safe you are? Many of us including me thought that blogging is among a good profession which makes you bucks just by sitting behind your laptop. But it is not so, be careful for what you are writing or blogging. Many people have took up blogging as their profession and contribute full time on blogging. I agree that you can make hundreds or thousands of dollars with minimal effort, but anything wrong on your blog may cost your life.&#160; Few days ago I came across this <a href="http://powerbloggingtips.blogspot.com/2008/11/bloggers-are-increasingly-being.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://powerbloggingtips.blogspot.com/2008/11/bloggers-are-increasingly-being.html', 'blog post']);" >blog post</a>, that says "Bloggers are increasingly being arrested, sued and prosecuted".

  After reading the whole <a href="http://powerbloggingtips.blogspot.com/2008/11/bloggers-are-increasingly-being.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://powerbloggingtips.blogspot.com/2008/11/bloggers-are-increasingly-being.html', 'article']);" >article</a> you too may realize the responsibility of a blogger. The author has described how bloggers are being humiliated. Even because of a small mistake committed on your blog, you may have to end up with hassles for the rest of your life. My intention behind writing this article is not to scare bloggers, rather I just wanted to alert you for your doings on this virtual world. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  I am highlighting some of the key points you must remember as a blogger:
</p>

  * <div>
      Do not copy contents from the web with proper credits. It may be a case of copy rights infringement act, moreover you may get banned by your host.
    </div>

  * <div>
      Do not use abusive or harsh languages.
    </div>

  * <div>
      Do not leak secret information of government authorities.
    </div>

  * <div>
      If possible, do not protest any one on your blog.
    </div>

  * <div>
      Do not publish any news that you are not sure about. For this you should rely only on some official news.
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  Keeping in mind, the above points, may lead your career as a successful, happy and a safe blogger <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br />Let me again remind you, please rethink about what your are posting because <a href="http://labnol.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labnol.org', 'Amit Agarwal']);" >Amit Agarwal</a> says "there is no delete button on the internet". Once you hit &#8216;publish&#8217; the contents are stored on the internet forever.
