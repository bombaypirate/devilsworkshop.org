  Just came across this cool stuff &#8211; <a href="http://www.twittermail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twittermail.com', 'TwitterMail']);" >TwitterMail</a> and found that it is very useful for tweeters.. <strong>By using this service, you can send tweets using any mail program</strong>. But you would surely say why should someone use mail program for tweeting leaving behind many user friendly applications. But, with my personal experience I would say it is really worth a try. It has several such features, which I think isn&#8217;t provided by any other twitter based app.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  To start using this service, you need to register with <a href="http://www.twittermail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twittermail.com', 'TwitterMail']);" >TwitterMail</a> with your existing twitter login and then they will provide you with a unique mail id, which you need to use to send tweets. The interface is too simple, you just need to send an email with your message on the body of the mail. What I like in TwitterMail is its support to schedule tweets.

  Some of the advantages of TwitterMail are mentioned here:
</p>

  * <div align="justify">
      Helpful when you use public computers with no twitter based app.. You need not sign into twitter separately.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      You can send them tweets when Twitter.com is down, tweets will be published as soon as twitter.com will be up
    </div>

      If you get a reply on twitter, they will be right in your inbox. Yes! All new replies will be sent to you via E-mail automatically.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      To get recent tweets by your friends, you can send a mail with the subject line as "Friends".
