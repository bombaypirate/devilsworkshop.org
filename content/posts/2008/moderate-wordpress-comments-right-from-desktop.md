  There&#8217;s a good news for blogger using WordPress as their blogging platform. The new plugin &#8216;Moderator&#8217; developed by <a href="http://www.danieldura.com/code/moderator." onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.danieldura.com/code/moderator.']);" >Daniel</a> is really a boon for blogger who have got to moderate heavy amount of comments each day. This Adobe Air based app, currently in beta, helps you to approve all your moderated comments just within few seconds even without leaving your work.

  * <div align="justify">
      Viewing unmoderated comments.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Dock and system tray notifications of the number of unmoderated comments.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Accept, delete, and spam comments from within the desktop client.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Close application window, or minimize it to the system tray while running.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Shows the Gravatar icons for the user who posted the comment.
    </div>

The installation of this app is really very simple and takes a few moments to get started.   
You are simply needed to download the <a href="http://www.danieldura.com/moderatorfiles/moderator_plugin.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.danieldura.com/moderatorfiles/moderator_plugin.zip', 'plugin']);" >plugin</a>, and install it on your WordPress blog. Then activate the plugin and go to settings page for further instructions to download its desktop app.&#160;   
For step by step installation procedure you may refer Daniel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.danieldura.com/code/moderator." onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.danieldura.com/code/moderator.']);" >blog</a>.

Though this is really a welcoming app by all blogger, it has some disadvantages too <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />   
To my dismay, after installing it, I found that there is no option to reply to the comments moderated and it supports only 1 blog at a time. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It would have been really great if a &#8216;reply&#8217; option too was present in this plugin. About multiple blog support option, Daniel have mentioned that he is working on it and is the top priority on its further releases. Infact we all know that this app is a beta release, we can expect improvements on later releases.&#160; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If any blogger is already using it, please post your experience with this Adobe based app.
