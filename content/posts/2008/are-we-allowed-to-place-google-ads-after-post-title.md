<a href="http://www.google.com/adsense" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/adsense', 'Google Adsense']);" title="Google Adsense"  target="_blank">Google Adsense</a> no doubt is the best known service to earn money through blog/site. Almost all the bloggers use this service and most of them just register with AdSense without even reading their <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=48182" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=48182', 'TOS']);" >TOS</a>.

I have seen a lot of Bloggers placing ads between post title and post body. Rahul also posted a tutorial for Blogger on Showing Ads After Each Post. This trick surely increases click through rate but are we violating Google&#8217;s TOS by placing ads after post title?

Recently, I read a post on <a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/2008/03/another-look-at-optimizations.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://adsense.blogspot.com/2008/03/another-look-at-optimizations.html', 'Google Adsense Official Blog']);" >Google Adsense Official Blog</a> saying,

> Ads shouldn&#8217;t be placed under a title or section heading in a way that implies that the ads are not ads.

They provided following screenshot. Have a look&#8230;

The image above clearly signifies what they are talking about and many bloggers still have placed ads using this format. As we all know that Google does not even warn before disabling account. So beware.

**Update by Editor:** If you still want to use place ment like above, you can put a line of text containing *&#8220;ADVERTISEMENT&#8221;* or *&#8220;SPONSORED LINKS&#8221; *in between Title and Adsense block. Still, this is something what big bloggers are doing and not what is clearly mentioned by AdSense. So go ahead at your own risk!
