Two days back I posted about upcoming [Facebook Chat feature][1]&#8230; Its live now!

**Here are screenshots&#8230;**

[<img class="wp-image-51953" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="335" alt="Facebook Chat - Default Version" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/image-thumb30.png" width="495" border="0" />][2] 

[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="335" alt="Facebook Chat - Chatting in action" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/image-thumb31.png" width="495" border="0" />][3] 

**Pop-out Window&#8230;**

[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="397" alt="Facebook Chat - Pop-out windows" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/image-thumb32.png" width="402" border="0" />][4] 

**Here are prominent features as highlighted by facebook&#8230;**

  * Start instant conversations with all of your friends.
  * Check the Online Friends menu to see who is online now.
  * A green dot means your friend is available to chat.
  * Don&#8217;t want to chat? Make yourself unavailable.

**few more&#8230;**

  * You can update your status from chat panel
  * feature is implemented as a chat-bar. So length of page have no effect on user experience
  * speed is quite impressive *(atleast as of now)* considering the overall slow facebook! 

**To-Do list&#8230;**

  * Group chat is not there as explained earlier.
  * There is no invisible status option. You can go offline but you can&#8217;t hide&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

It turn out to be much better than [what I have expected][1]. Specially pop-out chat window is something Gmail team have a look at. I am wondering why Gmail never thought about giving extra features in pop-out window!
