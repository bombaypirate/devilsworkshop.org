In past, whenever I wrote any post for [symbian][1] [OS][1] [mobiles][2], I recieved many comments/mails saying that SIS files I referred cannot be installed. The problem was many of them was unsigned. While few people turn-off certificate (signed) verification, rest either don&#8217;t know how to do it or need a signed version for some reason.

**First how to turn-off sign checking&#8230;**

Go into <span style="font-style: italic"><strong>menu > tools > settings > applications > app.manager.</strong></span> Turn software installation to **all** and online certificate check to **off.**

**<span style="font-weight: normal">This may vary little depending on your handset model. But the process is similar. This will allow you to use any app that hasn&#8217;t been digitally signed.</span>**

**Next how to get a symbian app signed online&#8230;**

There is an <a href="http://developer.symbian.com/main/signed/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developer.symbian.com/main/signed/', 'Open Signed']);" >Open Signed</a> program, currently in beta, which do signing job for symbian application. Its free but have few limitation and also note the restrictions before using the service.

<span style="line-height: normal">The service is quite simple to use. Just enter your handsets IMEI number, email address, and upload the unsigned SIS file. You will get it signed.</span>
