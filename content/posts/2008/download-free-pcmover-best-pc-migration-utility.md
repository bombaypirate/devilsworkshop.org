<a href="http://www.laplink.com/pcmover/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.laplink.com/pcmover/', 'PCMover']);" >PCMover</a> is a migration utility by Laplink softwares to transfer files, settings, installed software, etc from one Windows machine to another Windows machine. Here Windows machine can be a real PC or a virtual machine running on any platform <span style="font-style: italic">e.g. XP/Vista via Parallels or BootCamp in Mac</span>.

LapLink Software is celebrating their 25th anniversary by giving this $49.95 software free. Also their partner firms are offering many softwares at unbelievable prices.

Simply install PCmover on both your old and PCmover will determine which programs, files, and settings need to be moved, and when the transfer is complete, your new computer will have the personality and functionality of your old PC plus all of its own pre-installed software.

I will personally give it try as I have a Windows XP desktop computer and also XP on my Mac using BootCamp as well as Parallels.
