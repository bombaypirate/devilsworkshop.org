Just noticed on my <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/reports-payment" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/reports-payment', 'AdSense Payment History Page']);" >AdSense Payment History Page</a>, that recent check is issued with crazy exchange rate of 1:1!

After visiting AdSense help Google group, I have noticed that <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/87a97ab64c903d3d#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/87a97ab64c903d3d#', 'many']);" >many</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/67a34cbe501e5f29#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/67a34cbe501e5f29#', 'publishers']);" >publishers</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/71172cf2f8a24084#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/71172cf2f8a24084#', 'mostly']);" >mostly</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-basics/browse_thread/thread/c1a17f717a028574#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-basics/browse_thread/thread/c1a17f717a028574#', 'from']);" >from</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/8691ce9f9deb34d1#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/8691ce9f9deb34d1#', 'India']);" >India</a> are facing same problem. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/msg/f32126660594bcc2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/msg/f32126660594bcc2', 'This particular message']);" >This particular message</a> is receipt of AdSense team being aware of the problem. So all I can say, do not get panic!

The other question remains whether you will get a small check in local currency at exchange rate of 1:1 or is it just problem with web-interface?

If you are an experienced AdSense publisher, then you must have noticed that every **Payment Details **page shows &#8220;Payment Number&#8221;, which is in this case is blank. So I think payments are already processed correctly and soon web-interface will show accurate information.

Anyway, if you get check at exchange rate of 1:1, I am sure difference will be credited back to our account for sure automatically by Google AdSense team.

Point of writing is, do not get panic and do not flood already busy AdSense team with support requests related to the issue. They are working on this (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/msg/f32126660594bcc2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/msg/f32126660594bcc2', 'proof']);" >proof</a>).

Just in case, you need follow-up, keep watching <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/8691ce9f9deb34d1#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help-earnings/browse_thread/thread/8691ce9f9deb34d1#', 'this thread']);" >this thread</a>.
