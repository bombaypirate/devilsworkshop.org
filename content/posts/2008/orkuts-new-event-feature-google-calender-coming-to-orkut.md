Just noticed half-baked events feature on Orkut in left sidebar as highlighted in screenshot below.

Technically this feature is completely useless as of now. I tried adding events to it but failed to find option to do that in the first place. It looks like this event feature will act like a To-Do manager application. Whatever Google is upto, lets hope this time we will see some nice integration with Google&#8217;s already existing <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/calendar/', 'calendar service']);" >calendar service</a>.

It took forever for Google to poorly integrate Picasa with Orkut. Yes, if you don&#8217;t know, then you can insert Picasa images into Orkut scrap. [Details are here][1].
