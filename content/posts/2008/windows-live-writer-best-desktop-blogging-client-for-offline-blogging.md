A desktop blogging client is a software which help you write blog posts from your desktop without logging into your blogs admin section. They normally have better WYSIWYG editors than those online post editors among&#160; and support blogging to multiple blogs. Also most desktop blogging client works offline so that you can write posts anytime from anywhere and you will need Internet connection only at the time of posting. Sounds great piece of software, isn’t it?

Like other useful software categories, you have many desktop blogging client to choose from. But on Windows, Microsoft’s <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://get.live.com/writer/overview', 'Windows Live Writer']);" >Windows Live Writer</a> dominates by its largest list of features and attractive price tag of **$FREE**.

Windows Live Writer is by any standard the best desktop blogging client ever made, and its much better than most paid alternatives. I paid $20 for <a href="http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/', 'ecto']);" >ecto</a> on Mac but its not even close to Windows Live Writer. 

Anyway for Windows user, below is list of attractive <a href="http://get.live.com/writer/features" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://get.live.com/writer/features', 'features']);" >features</a> Windows Live Writer offers…
