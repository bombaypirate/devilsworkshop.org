Orkut is seriously copying things from Facebook. First, [drag and drop option to rearrange profile][1], then [photo-tagging][2], [applications][3] ([open-social][4]), [status update][5], last weeks [wall-to-wall like conversation][6] feature and now the photo comments of your friends photos is in your recent update as highlighted in screenshot below:

But unlike Facebook, you can see only your friends photo comment updates but not those on which your friends are commenting. On Facebook you can see every photo comment posted by your friend, even if the photo owner is not in your friend list.
