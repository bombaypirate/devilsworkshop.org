First this post doesn&#8217;t deal with technical stuff or any hack so if you are busy you can skip this!

Now first thanks 4 reading on&#8230; Seems you like our work! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So this post is to tell you things we have improved / newly added here at Devils Workshop in last few week. There are many things happening behind the scene here but I will brief about only those which can make any difference to you&#8230;

&nbsp;

### 2 New RSS Feeds Added&#8230;

When I looked back I noticed that we have around 40% post about orkut only. Although the share of orkut here is going down as I personally moved to other geekish things than flirting with girls on orkut, I still love to code for orkut users as they are amongst first few people out there when I started this workshop.

So not to bore orkut fans here with my other geeky stuff and vice-versa we have added 2 new feeds here&#8230;

  1. [<img class="wp-image-54538" src="http://lib.rtcamp.com/img/favicon/rss.png" alt="RSS" width="16" height="16" border="0" />][1] [ONLY Orkut ][1]&#8211; This will contains everything related to orkut only
  2. [<img class="wp-image-54538" src="http://lib.rtcamp.com/img/favicon/rss.png" alt="RSS" width="16" height="16" border="0" />][2]Â [EXCEPT Orkut][2] &#8211; This will have all posts other than Orkut

Those who like all stuff here can continue to use our [old feed][3]Â [<img class="wp-image-54538" src="http://lib.rtcamp.com/img/favicon/rss.png" alt="RSS" width="16" height="16" border="0" />][3] which will coexist with these 2 new feeds.

&nbsp;

### Forum Started&#8230;

I like to respond personally to each and every query by mail but being a human (yep.. this Devil is human inside!) I have my limits. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So to deal with increasing volume of emails and to avoid answering same question again and again I have started a forum out here! I guess it will help all of us as we continue to grow as a community!

### Some boring stuff&#8230;

We now added [Terms of Service][5] as well as [comment policy][6] to this blog. They are really short and simple!
