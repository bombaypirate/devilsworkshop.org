Originally developed for bookmark syncing, the addon was used in conjunction with Google’s now-out-of-development [Browser Sync][1] addon.

I posted long time back, how these two addons, [Foxmarks][2] and [Browser Sync][1], together can help you synchronize your online data from anywhere on the web. Over the time, Google stopped development of Browser Sync and released its <a href="http://code.google.com/p/browsersync/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://code.google.com/p/browsersync/', 'source code here']);" >source code here</a>. Since then, Firefox community was missing a really good addon to sync passwords, cookies, history, sessions and other sensitive data. 

Those who are already using Foxmarks, just need to update it. Once its done, you can go to Foxmarks settings, and from Sync options turn-on password synchronization. By default, its turned off.

If you like to know, how password synchronization works, please check this official wiki.

Foxmarks expected to have support for cookies, sessions and history sync in future versions. So if you are not using it or missing Google’s Browser Sync, start using Foxmarks.

The only thing that they need to change soon is their punch-line! It is no more just essential bookmarking addon! For me, its now essential Firefox addon… <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
