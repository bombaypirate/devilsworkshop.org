Form last few days <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/06/01/orkut-officially-launched-custom-themes-now/" target="_blank">Orkuts theme feature</a> is creating buzz. I am receiving lots of mails/comments with same questions again and again. This post is an attempt to answer some common FAQ…

**Q. Are Orkut Themes officially available for all users?**

One word answer is NO. They are limited to **few** Indian users only as mentioned in this official <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/06/if-youre-in-india-and-feel-like-change.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/06/if-youre-in-india-and-feel-like-change.html', 'orkut blog post']);" target="_blank">orkut blog post</a>. But don’t get disappointed, as you can still enjoy this theme feature by using a <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/06/05/new-orkut-album-privacy-feature-control-each-album-privacy-separately/" target="_blank">greasemonkey script</a> as explained <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/06/05/new-orkut-album-privacy-feature-control-each-album-privacy-separately/" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Q. ****How to know if you can use orkuts theme feature officially?**

All of below indicate theme feature is available to you…

  * When you log into your account you will see **‘change theme’** link beside logout option in top-right corner. [<img class="wp-image-50504" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="137" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/06/image-thumb27.png" width="420" border="0" />][1] 
  * When you can see themes on your friend profiles. Just check ‘**get this theme’** option which will appear then near logout option in top-right corner. 
  * Go to <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/EditSummary.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/EditSummary.aspx', 'Edit Profile']);" target="_blank">Edit Profile</a> option. A new tab, **themes** will be there! [<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="145" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/06/image-thumb28.png" width="420" border="0" />][2] 

**Q. ****Can these themes be seen my friend on orkut?**

If the person visiting your orkut profile also have this theme feature enabled on their account, they will see your profile in your selected theme unless they choose to disable the feature manually as explained below.

This is better than old <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2007/08/24/11-styles-themes-for-orkut/" target="_blank">greasemonkey script</a> & <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2006/07/31/orkut-skins-new-greasemonkey-scripts/" target="_blank">userstyle themes</a>.

**Q. ****I hate themes, I want old, clean & simple orkut back…**

YES, you can do that. In fact I have disabled themes on my account. 

To disable theme feature completely on your account, go to <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/EditSkin.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/EditSkin.aspx', 'Edit Skins']);" target="_blank">Edit Skins</a> option and check **Disable themes** option. You will now get old Orkut interface throughout the site. 

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="200" alt="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/06/image-thumb29.png" width="442" border="0" />][3] 

If you just want to keep your theme to old orkut but like to see how colorful your friends are then just select the **orkut blue **theme.

If you still have any other question regarding orkut themes please post it here via comments. I will try to answer it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p> </p> </p>
