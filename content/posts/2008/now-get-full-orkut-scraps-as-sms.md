But many users were disappointed because using this trick they get SMS only with the name of the scrap sender and not the full scrap messages. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

But you need not worry anymore. After working hard and contacting with the guys at Google, I found another trick using which you can get full messages of a scrap on your mobile as a SMS (of course it must be less than 150 Characters and not html contents).Â  <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  
For this, you just need to add &#8220;#both&#8221; at the end of the feed URL that you use in your SMS Channel.
