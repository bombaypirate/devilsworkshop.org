Rather than joining communities and groups or using various gaming apps at different sites, you can have a complete social gaming experience at doof.

As their homepage quotes,

> <p style="font: 12.0px Helvetica">
>   doof is all about playing online games, making friends and having fun. We like to call it social gaming and we think it&#8217;s great!

>   Easy to use and full of surprises, doof is casual gaming and social networking at its best.

The site uses flash heavily but most online gamers anyway needs broadband to have real fun. Signing up is simple and free.

Following is screenshot of my doof account. They call it doofSpace&#8230;
