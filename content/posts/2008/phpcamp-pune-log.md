<a href="http://phpcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://phpcamp.org/', '']);" ><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1952" title="phpcamp-pune1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/09/phpcamp-pune1.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="114" /></a>Yesterday, I was at <a href="http://phpcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://phpcamp.org/', 'PHPCamp']);" >PHPCamp</a> Pune for full day. Here is my log of event for those who missed it!

As usual, for all early morning events, I reached late and missed my free T-shirt. Actual reason was huge response to the event. Organizer printed 300 T-shirts but around 600 geeks turned up for the event! More than 1200 guys <a href="http://phpcamp.org/index.php/Campers.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://phpcamp.org/index.php/Campers.html', 'registered']);" >registered</a> for it. In fact, it was so overcrowded that venue sponsor <a href="http://www.persistentsys.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.persistentsys.com/', 'Persistent']);" >Persistent</a> denied access to the lift and asked people to use the staircase to the 7th floor! Smarty me, didn‚Äôt do that. I used lift between 1st and 6th Floor. üòâ

**Now something really important&#8230; **

There were lots of talks on Drupal and Joomla, two popular CMSes. Those who use them or work on them must have been greatly benefited.

Apart from this another hot topic was [OpenSocial][1]. Out of all talks on OpenSocial, I liked one given by <a href="http://www.sourishnath.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sourishnath.com/blog/', 'Pravin Nirmal']);" >Pravin Nirmal</a>. He presented his topic very nicely with live demo of an Orkut App. He also cleared lots of my doubts regarding OpenSocial and Orkut Apps. You can expect my first Orkut App within a month. If you have any nice idea for an Orkut app, please share it with us. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I spent most of my time with <a href="http://wanderer.lifeinlines.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wanderer.lifeinlines.com/', 'Ankur Gattani']);" >Ankur Gattani</a>, young entrepreneur behind <a href="http://www.lifeinlines.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lifeinlines.com/', 'LifeinLines']);" >LifeinLines</a>. If you missed my [earlier review about LifeinLines][2], its [here][2]. It was nice to know his plans for LifeinLines and if you are using it, expect a lot of cool features in coming days.

Apart from it, I was privileged to meet <a href="http://cbas.pandion.be/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cbas.pandion.be/', 'Sebastiaan Deckers']);" >Sebastiaan Deckers</a>, a member of <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.xmpp.org/', 'XMPP']);" >XMPP</a> (Jabber) Foundation and developer of <a href="http://www.pandion.be/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pandion.be/', 'Pandion']);" >Pandion</a> chat client. Those who don‚Äôt know, famous Google Talk uses XMPP protocol for communications.

**And lastly&#8230; **

It was really surprising to see that there was no single talk on WordPress and Facebook &#8211; two most-famous PHP apps! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Another bad thing was no wi-fi for campers. Again sponsor turned off wi-fi connectivity on campus. Sorry <a href="http://fundubytes.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fundubytes.blogspot.com/', 'Rupesh']);" >Rupesh</a>, this is the reason, I couldn‚Äôt blog about event while it was going on. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Apart from this, overall event was great, thanks to organizers, who really worked hard to make it successful.

Finally thanks to my friend <a href="http://anilwadghule.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://anilwadghule.com/', 'Anil']);" >Anil</a>‚Äôs younger bro Santosh, I got a cool T-shirt from <a href="http://www.directi.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.directi.com/', 'Directi']);" >Directi</a>. It has PHP logo on it with PHP defined as ‚Äì *‚ÄúPretty Hot Programmer‚Äù*. üòâ

**PhpCamp Links:** <a href="http://phpcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://phpcamp.org/', 'Official Site']);" >Official Site</a> | <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/phpcamp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.google.com/group/phpcamp', 'Google Group']);" >Google Group</a> | <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/phpcamp/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/groups/phpcamp/', 'Flickr Group for event pics']);" >Flickr Group for event pics</a>
