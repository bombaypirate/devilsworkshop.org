As expected, after making over <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-rolls-out-gmail-themes/" target="_blank">Gmail with themes</a>, Google has tried to revamp its <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/reader', 'feed reader']);" target="_blank">feed reader</a> as well. Unlike earlier, there&#8217;s more of white color instead of blue.

Well, I know you are desperate to know about the changes, I am coming to the point to discuss about the lift over made to Google reader&#8217;s look.

  * As discussed, the new look contains more of White color. Just have a look on the images below, and you too can feel that.
  * **Collapsible navigation**. As shown in the image below, you can collapse or expand, all the side bar menus
  * **Hide unread counts &#8211; **Using this option, you can hide the total unread items in your reader.
  * **Share options under individual section &#8211; **If you are not in a practice of sharing items to friends regularly, this would be helpful for you as you can hide the complete item using the new &#8216;Collapse&#8217; feature.
  * **More feed bundles &#8211; **There are more sets of inbuilt feeds available for you to subscribe in the go.

Truly speaking, as of now, I felt Google reader is too complicated as such I stuck with &#8216;Feed Reader&#8217;, but I guess, this new look and feel of Google reader will surely attract me towards it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> By the way I am still wondering, are themes (<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-rolls-out-gmail-themes/" target="_blank">as in Gmail</a>) in the way to Google reader too? What do you think about it?
