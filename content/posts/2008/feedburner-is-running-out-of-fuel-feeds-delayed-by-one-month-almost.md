We all know email is not reliable transport. Mails get lost, get delayed, etc. But when you are using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.feedburner.com/', 'Feedburner']);" >Feedburner</a>, a service now own by Google, to distribute your blogs newsletter via email, you normally expects some sort of reliability.

Now look at the following screenshot and you will be shocked to see delay in email delivery by feedburner.

Also same mail contained a post dated back to June 2, 2008. This means delay of 24 days or almost a month!

I just wish this did not happen to all DW readers who subscribed by email. Please let me know if you are getting deliveries delayed like this. I will try to find a nice feedburner alternative then, most likely <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.feedblitz.com/', 'FeedBlitz']);" >FeedBlitz</a>.
