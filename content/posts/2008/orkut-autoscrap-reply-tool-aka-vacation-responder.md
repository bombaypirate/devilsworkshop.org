<a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/09/autoscrap-reply-bot-set-and-send-auto-replies-to-your-scraps.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/09/autoscrap-reply-bot-set-and-send-auto-replies-to-your-scraps.html', 'Gaurav Dua']);" >Gaurav Dua</a> launched a new tool for Orkut users which allows you to send automatic replies to scraps. This can be used on lines of vacation responder feature found in popular mail services.

### How it Works?

  * First <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/toolkit/autobot/scrapbook-autobot-signup.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/toolkit/autobot/scrapbook-autobot-signup.php', 'signup for AutoScrap Reply']);" >signup for AutoScrap Reply</a>. (Its free)
  * At the time of signing up, you need to give your orkut login information and also write scrap text once. Reply scrap text can be anything. As an example you can write, *“Hey I am out on vacation, will revert back to you on Monday”.*
  * Next you will get a code which you need to embed in your scrapbook.
  * Now, whenever anyone send you a scrap, they will get set reply message automatically.
  * Next you can&#160; and his scrap is either kept or deleted from your scrapbook depending on the option you choose at the time of singing up.

You can change settings/scrap deletion option from control panel you will get at Orkut Plus. Your received scraps are also stored in your scraps page there.

This is really good, easy to use service for Orkut users who are not yet addicted to Orkut.
