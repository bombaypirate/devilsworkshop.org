There are too many search operators to remember. Also, not all of them are useful all the time. 

So I am describing today only the most frequently used search operators alongwith real-life examples. College students will particularly find examples more interesting! ðŸ˜‰

**>> **First note common syntax of following Google search operators&#8230;

`operator:parameter`

There should not be any space on either side of colon **[:]**

Also all search operator are case-sensitive!

&#160;

**\# site:** This operator is useful for searching a site and/or its subdomain.

  * ***site:devilsworkshop.org*** will restrict search to all subdomain under devilsworkshop.org 
  * ***site:edu* **will search all site in **edu** top domain. Useful for researchers and college students while studying and writing for papers as ***site:edu*** will restrict search results to the educational sites! 

&#160;

**\# filetype:** You can directly use Google to search any type of files.

  * ***filetype:ppt*** to search all presentation slides. This is how I manage to create presentations just one night before! ðŸ˜‰ 
  * ***filetype:pdf*** will search only pdf files! Good for searching ebooks. 
  * ***filetype:pdf site:edu ***will return all files with **pdf** extensions from edu domain. Useful to complete journals or study assignments! 

&#160;

**\# inurl: **To search something in URLs 

  * ***inurl:md5* **will find keyword md5 in URLs. 
  * ***inurl:md5 filetype:java* **will return all java source files with md5 in their name or URL. How about using this to complete programming assignments in college! 

Also try **allinurl: **operator which looks all keywords into **URL** only!

&#160;

**\# intitle: **To search something in page title. Useful when searching a too common word.

  * **intitle:md5** will return all documents having md5 in their title. 
  * ***intitle:Hacking filetype:pdf*** will return all pdf files i.e. mostly ebooks and papers about hacking. 

Also try **allintitle: **operator which looks all keywords into **title** only!

&#160;

**\# define: **To use Google search as dictionary. There are other dedicated dictionary services but none of them is as clean and fast as Google.

  * ***define:hacker ***will show meanings of hacker. 
  * ***define:network security ***will return meaning of network security. 
  * Note: Do not type anything before **define: **or combine it with other operators! 

&#160;

**\# OR **&#8211; To combine results of multiple searches! By default Google performs ANDing on keywords we use while searching. But sometimes explicit OR can help more.

  * ***filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc*** will search for pdf as well as doc files. This will help you complete your journals&#160; 
  * ***site:en.wikipedia.org OR site:howstuffworks.com ***will restrict search to Wikipedia English and How Stuff Works site! 

Note **OR** must be in capital and it doesn&#8217;t have **colon** after it!
