Today we are celebrating second anniversary of Devils Workshop. Started as a hobby, over the time this workshop has become [my source of living][1].

Devils workshop owes its success to all of you but there are some people without whom things would have been harder. Below are the names and roles of some special devils.

**Payback&#8230;**

They blogged here apart from me. These guys will be receiving **1 year** <a href="http://rapidshare.com/premium2.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rapidshare.com/premium2.html', 'rapidshare premium account']);" >rapidshare premium account</a> sponsored by <a href="http://www.tejasdave.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tejasdave.com/', 'Tejas Dave']);" >Tejas Dave</a>, a security expert from India. If you are also interested in joining Devils Workshop as writer [check this article][2].
  * <a href="http://www.corpseofattic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.corpseofattic.com/', 'Guarav']);" >Guarav</a>, <a href="http://www.techpavan.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techpavan.com/', 'Pavan']);" >Pavan</a> and <a href="http://praveen.ampli5.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://praveen.ampli5.org/', 'Praveen']);" >Praveen</a> will get a link to their blog in blogroll (at the bottom). Please do not confuse this with link-exchange. Guys you do not need to link back to this blog from your blog. These three are chosen for their valuable comments on posts at Devils Workshop. Coincidently these three are also among top 5 commentators here. Rest two are Adi Gosavi who doesn&#8217;t own a blog and <a href="http://www.funfilledblog.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.funfilledblog.org/', 'Johnson']);" >Johnson</a> who is already there in blogroll.

**Now its party time&#8230;**

  * **Entracard 250 Credits**: 1 random reader will get **250** <a href="http://entrecard.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://entrecard.com/', 'entrecard']);" >entrecard</a> credits. If you use entrecard just post a comment with **&#8220;I want entrecard credit&#8221;** in it and you will be counted in for entrecard draw. Draw will be held on 16 June, 12PM, IST. A user will be picked randomly by <a href="http://anilwadghule.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://anilwadghule.com/blog/', 'Anil Wadghule']);" >Anil Wadghule</a>, a ruby gem himself!
  * **Free domain and wordpress hosting for two**: Self-hosted wordpress is the best way to blog <span style="font-style: italic">(seriously)</span> but it requires some $$$ for domain and good web-hosting service like <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?302379/hosting.html', 'dreamhost']);" >dreamhost</a>. So two of our readers will get free domain registration and hosting space from us. Also, if they want they will be provided all the technical support for their wordpress maintenance. I, personally feel this is most exciting offer from us so rather going for random draw, post via comments the very purpose of your blog. Two persons will be selected by <a href="http://www.insideorkut.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.insideorkut.com/', 'Darnell Clayton']);" >Darnell Clayton</a> and <a href="http://tech-buzz.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tech-buzz.net/', 'Thilak']);" >Thilak</a>. Submission is open till 16th June. Result will be declared till 20th June as per the convenience of our judges. I am yet to get their approvals and time-slots.
  * **Advertise for $1 on 100,000 pages**: We run six 125&#215;125 image ad slots in sidebar where each one is priced at $10/month. Now as part of our celebration, two slots will be given for $1 and $2 price for a month (~100,000 page views). Slots are given on first-come-first-serve basis. So rush to [advertise][3] on 100,000 pages for just $1. Of course, your site must not include porn, drugs or any sort of illegal content.

If anything is unclear, please ask via **comments** **only**. In case, you like to sponsor a gift for our readers, please [contact us][4].

Thank you all once again&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
