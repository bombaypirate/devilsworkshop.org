  The year 2008 is going to end and we have seen many new features and changes in Orkut. Also, as expected, the year saw a rapid increase in the users of Orkut with the launch of many exciting features like <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/orkut-officially-launched-custom-themes-now/" target="_blank">launch of themes</a>, <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-integrates-talk-with-orkut/" target="_blank">integration of Gtalk with Orkut</a>, <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/more-features-introduced-for-orkut-photo-sharing/" target="_blank">new photo sharing options</a>, etc.
</p>

  And now, guys at Orkut help group wants you to spend a few minutes on sending them helpful and useful comments and feedback specially for the new photo sharing feature launched recently. You can share your view with them just by filling a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cFJ3b21TUkc0SHV1TkxkTnJLZFhnV3c6MA" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cFJ3b21TUkc0SHV1TkxkTnJLZFhnV3c6MA', 'short survey form']);" target="_blank">short survey form</a> that may not take more than 5 minutes to fill completely. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I would personally suggest you to write whatever you think about Orkut and its new photo sharing feature, because it is our feedback that encourage them to roll out exciting and new features every alternative day.
