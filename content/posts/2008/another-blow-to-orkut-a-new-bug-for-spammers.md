Remember above image? Few weeks ago we published a [bug in Orkut&#8217;s click tracking mechanism][1] which let spammer send third party links bypassing image verification!

Now for those who missed that&#8230; A new bug is found in Google Video search history feature! Now Whats a big deal you might say? Well Google Videos and Orkut are both owned by Google Inc. So URL which contains **google.com** in domain part never encounters image verification!

**Now consider link below:**

`http://upload.video.google.com/searchhistory/url?url=//www.devilsworkshop.org`

&#160;

You can replace any site URL with **www.devilsworkshop.org** in it and put the link in scraps! Orkut will never ask for image verification!

This bug is more severe compared to [bug in Click Tracking mechanism][1]. Fixing this may be still simple but there are many Googles service and so there must be many bugs like this! All this means a lot more spam in coming month on Orkut&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
