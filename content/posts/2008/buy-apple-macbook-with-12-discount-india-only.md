A good news for students, faculty and staff members of educational institutes in India. You guys can buy Apple Macbook laptops for 12% discount till August 30, 2008.

I brought Apple Macbook Pro 4 months back and I am really happy with my decision. In facts its one of the best decision I took which boost my productivity many folds.

If you are a person who is thinking about switching to Mac, then this is best time as current Macbook comes with Leopard, which allows you to install Windows XP/VIsta in dual-boot environment.

**Here are new prices for macbook series laptops&#8230;**
