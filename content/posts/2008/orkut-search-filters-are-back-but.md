Orkut restored search filters with new interface which is much cleaner and easier to use. [Search filters gone missing][1] few days back breaking one of my best trick to [find a date in your city][2].

<a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=A&q=pune" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=A&q=pune', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-54478" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/07/image24.png" border="0" alt="Orkut Search Filters" width="162" height="280" align="right" /></a>Unfortunately new search filters which appear good in terms of visual appearance lacks advance control they used to provide in past. This also means our dating trick will no longer work and you to take lots of efforts to find a right match for you.

Anyway good news is that search filters are now expanded beyond orkut to cover global search filters like county & language specific filtering.

There are some filters now to filter out communities based on some categories which orkut suggests based in your community history. While topic filters are blank as of now. I hope orkut will add more stuff their.
