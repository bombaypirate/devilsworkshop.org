Just noticed some minor but nice changes on Orkut album pages. Looks like Orkut team really got a creative mind on board as few days back they nicely enhanced [birthday reminder section][1] on homepage.

Earlier album listing and individiual photo listing in album had same user interface, with 4 rows and 3 columns. It used to create little confusion about thumbnail you are viewing as it could be photo inside album or album cover itself.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2238" style="border: 1px solid black" title="orkut-new-album-format-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/10/orkut-new-album-format-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="360" />][2]

Now albums are given more weight and details as they always deserved and result in next to you&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I guess Orkut can still make use of free space, next to thumbnail on right-side, to give more details about albums. Like total number of comments, or list of people tagged in current album.
