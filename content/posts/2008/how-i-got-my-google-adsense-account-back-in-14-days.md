On Friday, October 10, 2008 I got an email from Google AdSense Team and I was shocked to read that my AdSense account is disabled due to invalid clicks.

It was really an embarrassing moment as there were 160$ on hold. Then finally, I decided to write an application to Google and I got a reply on Wednesday, October 15, 2008 saying :

On Friday, October 24, 2008 AdSense Team replied to my mail and I got my account back. When I opened my AdSense account my 160$ were still in it. <span class="illustration">It was hard to keep my feet on the ground. Then I decided to share my experience on how I got my AdSense account back in 14 days. Lets start :<br /> </span>

**My habit saved my account :**

I have a habit to take screenshot of my AdSense account daily . When ever I noticed invalid clicks I used to take a screenshot, note the exact date and time and request invalid clicks. <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?search_ask=4&subtopic=&contact=2&main_topic=invalid_clicks&contact_type=20&contact_topic=Reporting+unusual+activity+on+my+account&Action.Search=Continue" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?search_ask=4&subtopic=&contact=2&main_topic=invalid_clicks&contact_type=20&contact_topic=Reporting+unusual+activity+on+my+account&Action.Search=Continue', 'Click here']);" target="_blank">Click here</a> to visit <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?search_ask=4&subtopic=&contact=2&main_topic=invalid_clicks&contact_type=20&contact_topic=Reporting+unusual+activity+on+my+account&Action.Search=Continue" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?search_ask=4&subtopic=&contact=2&main_topic=invalid_clicks&contact_type=20&contact_topic=Reporting+unusual+activity+on+my+account&Action.Search=Continue', 'Invalid Clicks Contact Form']);" target="_blank">Invalid Clicks Contact Form</a>

**Where did I Appeal about disabled account :**

When your account gets disabled by Google just remember that you have only one chance to make an appeal. So, your mail should be impressive and well written. You can write to Google from <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?contact=invalid_clicks_appeal" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?contact=invalid_clicks_appeal', 'Online Appeal Form']);" title="Online Appeal Form">Online Appeal Form</a>

**What did I write :**

As mentioned above about my habit, I wrote a big mail to Google giving them the exact date, time and screenshot about the invalid clicks. I knew it was my first and last chance, I also told them about my previous earnings.

Just after 14 days I got an mail from AdSense Team saying :

> Thank you for clarifying your situation. We have reviewed your  
> circumstances and have reinstated your account, effective immediately.  
> Please note that there will be a delay of up to 48 hours before our  
> servers are informed of the update and ads start running on your website  
> again.

**Editor&#8217;s Note:** Congrats Gagan for getting back his Adsense account. I came across many such incidents recently. I hope Gagan&#8217;s post will help guys in trouble.
