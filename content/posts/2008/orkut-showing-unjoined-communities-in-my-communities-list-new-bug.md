As pointed out by <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/05/dear-orkut-some-unknown-communities-are.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/05/dear-orkut-some-unknown-communities-are.html', 'Gaurva Dua']);" >Gaurva Dua</a>, I also noticed 2 unknown communities on my <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Communities.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/Communities.aspx', 'communities page']);" >communities page</a>.

[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="235" alt="Orkut communities section on profile page" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/05/image-thumb10.png" width="204" align="right" border="0" />][2] Strangely both communities are not visible into communities section on user profiles. That means such unjoined communities will not be visible to your friends. Thats good as far as privacy concerns, as there are lots of indecent communities on orkut which a decent orkut user will never like to join.

Coming back to the topic, is you noticed in above screenshot, then these extra communities are not joined yet. So you can&#8217;t unjoin them directly in order to remove from your communities page.

So first you have to join them and then only unjoin will work.

**Technical Details&#8230;**

The only place where strange communities has been seen is &#8211; <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Communities.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/Communities.aspx', 'communities page']);" >communities page</a>. This indicates **community.aspx** clearly have some bugs. Although not a sever one as of now, but who can predict a bug&#8217;s feature. So it will be better, if orkut team will correct this ASAP&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
