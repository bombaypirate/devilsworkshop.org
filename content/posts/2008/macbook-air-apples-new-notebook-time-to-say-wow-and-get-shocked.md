Yep! The rumors were true. MacBook Air is in the air now as Steve Jobs unveiled according to him, *&#8220;world&#8217;s thinnest notebook.&#8221;*

As it used to happen with other thin notebooks this doesn&#8217;t compromise on keyboard, display or speed! With 13.3&#8243; display, full size keyboard, 2 GB Memory and Intel Core 2 Duo processor everyone will have to answer **Yes** to Steve Jobs question &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it great?&#8221; which he asked at the end of keynote! One step ahead forget about compromising on specs, this comes with bigger touchpad, next generation wireless technology and battery-life of 5 hours when wireless is on!

And while doing all this Apple did not forget its commitment with nature. Highly recyclable aluminum enclosure, Mercury-free LCD display with arsenic-free glass, amongst other things makes MacBook Air eco-friendly.

**Now Lets move to specs that made us utter &#8220;WOW&#8221;&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> **
