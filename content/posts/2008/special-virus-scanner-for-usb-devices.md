  You would think why I am writing such bogus topic, there are many anti virus program available over the internet still why what made me write about it.. Aren&#8217;t you thinking that?? Actually I am using this USB scanner &#8211; <a href="http://www.zbshareware.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zbshareware.com/', 'USB Disk Security']);" >USB Disk Security</a> since long. But few days back when I recommended this anti virus program to a friend of mine, he was really happy to know that this software really worked fine and specially prevented auto run viruses. And then, he wanted me to post about it.

  Actually this is really a nice anti virus program meant specially for USB scanning. I would personally recommend all <a href="http://www.devilsworkshop.org">DW</a> readers to install it if you use any USB devices.&#160; As said earlier, this is specially meant for USB scanning, so you need to install it apart from any other Anti virus program. The main advantage of using this app is that, it blocks auto run of your USB devices and scans any them as soon you plug it into your USB port (refer above screenshot).
