Google Talk is my favorite messenger like many of you and so my friend-list there is quite long. While I love to chat most of the times, I want some sort of privacy while developing codes. I can not sign out completely from messengers, as at times I need to communicate with many geeks for help. So I was one of the person who delighted when [Gmail chat got invisible status][1]. But to my surprise Google Talk is not yet updated. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I personally prefer Google Talk over Gmail Chat so I googled for some solution and found a free software gAlwaysIdle which changes Google Talk context menu shown in screenshot below&#8230;

It basically adds a set of status options as you can see in above image!

As highlighted you can choose **Always Idle** if you are too busy at work. Many users will think that you are not at desk or something similar and thus won&#8217;t bother you. ðŸ˜‰

Also there is an exactly opposite option &#8211; **Never Idle. **In case you want to look always online no matter even if you forget to shut down your PC at night!

**Update: **Many user have reported that gAlwaysIdle original site is down from long time. You can [download gAlwaysIdle from our server][2] till then.
