Orkut finally considered increasing amount of spam and now transferred job of fighting against it to community owner, co-owners and moderators.

In recent development they added a spam folder to communities as shown below&#8230;

Now whenever you find a spam topic, click on **report spam** button on orkut and the topic will be moved to spam folder.

You will see a confirmation like below then&#8230;

Spam folder will look like below&#8230;

Now when a community owner, co-owner or any moderator will click on a spam topic, he will see options like below&#8230;

Seems a nice move from orkut but they should consider more automated approach.
