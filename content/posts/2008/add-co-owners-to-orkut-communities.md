A great news for all orkut community owners. A recent feature from orkut will enhance security against community hijacking as well as loosing community when your account gets deleted or compromised.

This new feature let you add 2 co-owners beside 10 moderators.

Co-owners will have following powers&#8230;

  * A co-owner can gain ownership of the community in case the owner&#8217;s account is compromised or there is a transfer in ownership.
  * If the community is deleted the co-owner can undelete it and become the owner.

Also when a community is transfered or deleted, any previous owner or co-owner within the last 15 days can assume ownership of the community by clicking on the &#8216;gain ownership&#8217; link visible only to them. The owner or co-owner who had owned the community earlier will have priority for assuming ownership.

**Steps To Add Co-owners**

**#Method 1: <span style="font-weight: normal">When you click on add co-owner link, you will be taken to a page where you can search community memebers by name and choose upyo 2 members to grant them co-owner privilege.</span>**

**#Method 2: <span style="font-weight: normal">Searching is little tedious and fancy profile names on orkut makes it more complicated. So better click on</span> manage icon <span style="font-weight: normal">as highlighted below beside member names on community pages. It will open options specific to that members, where cilckin on</span> grant co-owner privilege <span style="font-weight: normal">will make them co-owner.</span>**

This method is better in case you want to choose co-owners from moderators.

Finally if you really love your community and want to protect it anyhow, you can create a backup account on orkut and make your second profile co-owner.
