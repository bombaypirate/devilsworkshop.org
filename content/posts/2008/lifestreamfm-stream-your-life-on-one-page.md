<span style="line-height: normal;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">As of now there are 57 services are available to add into your account which includes famous services like Facebook, Digg, del.icio.us, Flickr, Google Reader, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, LastFM.</span></span>

When you start adding services at Lifestream, it gets all past content as well so creating sort of your biography over one page. One can look at Lifestream as twitter for your entire digital life.

If you are blogger then you can show this steam on your blog as well using Lifestream badge.

For easier access, the service already have desktop interface ready via an Adobe Air app. This means all Windows, Mac, Linux users can enjoy this service from their desktop.

I hope to see support for more services, specially my favorite Orkut soon at Lifestream.

As of now the service is in beta but their country manager Fabian Posada arranged few invitation codes for our readers. Thanks Fabian. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
