[<img class="wp-image-52390" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="240" alt="opensocial" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/opensocial-thumb.jpg" width="233" align="right" border="0" />][1] Looks like Orkut team overlooked our discussion on [Orkut Apps being launched in Estonia first][2]. Many Orkut users including me and, notably <a href="http://www.insideorkut.com/2008/04/google-launches-orkut-appsfor-estonia.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.insideorkut.com/2008/04/google-launches-orkut-appsfor-estonia.html', 'Darnell Clayton']);" >Darnell Clayton</a>, felt Orkut should selected Brazil, India or any bigger country like US rather than Estonia.

Now skipping Brazil, <a href="http://orkutdeveloper.blogspot.com/2008/04/launching-to-10-of-users-in-about-week.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdeveloper.blogspot.com/2008/04/launching-to-10-of-users-in-about-week.html', 'Orkut Developer Blog announced']);" >Orkut Developer Blog announced</a> today that in coming weeks OpenSocial apps will be available to millions of users in India. India have **16.90%** of total orkut users according to <a href="http://www.orkut.com/MembersAll.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/MembersAll.aspx', 'Orkut demographics']);" >Orkut demographics</a>.

I think Orkut should have gone for a global release this time. After the fact that anyone can use [OpenSocial apps just by changing their country to Estonia][2], this country-specific releases makes no sense! At the most in few weeks you will have one more country to choose from at par with Estonia! ðŸ˜‰

**For OpenSocial developers&#8230;**

On a sidenote, Orkut team created a <a href="http://sandbox.orkut.com/AppDirectorySubmit.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sandbox.orkut.com/AppDirectorySubmit.aspx', 'new app submission page']);" >new app submission page</a>. All apps, even if submitted previously, need to resubmit through this new page. 

If you are yet to start with OpenSocial orkut apps, here is the [beginners Open-Social guide covering FAQ][3].
