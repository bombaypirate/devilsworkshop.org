  A couple of months ago, there was a lot of buzz in the blogosphere about <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/', 'Downforeveryoneorjustme']);" >Downforeveryoneorjustme</a> which was used to check whether a given site is down just for you or for everyone? But <a href="http://dingitsup.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dingitsup.com/', 'Dingitsup']);" >Dingitsup</a> is another new service, that is bit unique as compared to Downforeveryoneorjustme.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Using <a href="http://dingitsup" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://dingitsup']);" >dingitsup</a>, you will be notified whenever you website or blog goes up or even when it is down. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> A good thing in this service is that you need not visit their site again and again, you will be notified in the way you like. Presently they have three notification options:
</p>

  * <div>
      <strong>Twitter</strong>: You will receive a tweet about such notifications
    </div>

  * <div>
      <strong>Email</strong>: They can even mail you the notifications in the mail id provided to them.
    </div>

  * <div>
      <strong>Text</strong>: They also have an option, wherein you can receive notifications via SMS messages. I guess, this is the best service, provided your mobile operator is supported by dingitsup.
    </div>

So, this service can be used as an alternative for Downforeveryoneorjustme as you do not have to bother about visiting the site again and again.
