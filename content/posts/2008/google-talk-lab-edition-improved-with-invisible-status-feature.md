Few months back, Google Talkâ€™s Gmail Chat version added <a href="pgchillpill@gmail.com" target="_blank">invisible status feature</a>, a much demanded feature in any messenger. Now another flavor of Google Talk, its lab edition also added invisible status feature.

&#160;[<img class="wp-image-51418" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="354" alt="Google Talk Lab Edition - Invisible Status Feature" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/06/image-thumb26.png" width="304" border="0" />][1] 

Still Google Talks desktop client have no signs of invisible chat feature. It was last updated in January 2007, more than a year ago. It seems that Google is no longer interested in adding more feature to Google Talk desktop client version and may replace it with final version of Google Talks lab edition which also run on windows desktop machine.

Until now, I was using a third-party tool <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/03/21/remain-always-idle-on-google-talk-free-download/" target="_blank">gAlwaysIdle</a> which sets Google Talk status to always idle. Although not good as invisible status, still it can prevent many unwanted people in friend-list to initiate chat with you. I am switching to Google Talk Lab Edition as chatting is something I prefer from desktop clients rather than browser. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
