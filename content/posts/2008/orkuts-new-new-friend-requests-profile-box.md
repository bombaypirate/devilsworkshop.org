Just noticed a change in ***"new friend requests"*** box on Orkuts user homepage. You can see it below&#8230;

[<img class="wp-image-53831" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;border-right-width: 0px" height="276" alt="orkuts new friend request" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/orkuts-new-friend-request-thumb.jpg" width="433" border="0" />][1] 

As you might have noticed already the option to "***Organize your friends"*** is improvement over the old "*new friend requests" *profile box!

Those who like to better organize their friend lists, this is really nice option for them as you no longer need to go to friends page to select group for friends.

Moreover if you want to create a new group for new friend then there is option of ***new group&#8230; ***Also a small link ***manage groups ***let you manage existing group smartly keeping you on same page (using AJAX).

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;border-right-width: 0px" height="194" alt="Orkut Manage Groups" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/02/image-thumb8.png" width="312" border="0" />][2] 

All this will reduce usability of orkuts friends page considerably.

Anyway a nice improvement by Orkut team I must say. Looks like Orkut Team is using facebook&#8230; üòâ
