Chris quotes,

> &#8220;there are many myths about how Google works and, while fairly harmless in themselves, these myths tend to allow people to draw incorrect conclusions about how Google works. The purpose of this article is to correct the most popular Google myths.&#8221;

**Following is list of 10 myths.** For explanation, visit Chris&#8217; article.

  1. The Higher Your Google PageRank (PR), the Higher You&#8217;ll be in the Search Results Listing
  2. The Google Toolbar will List Your Actual PageRank
  3. PageRank is a Value Based on the Number of Incoming Links to Your Site
