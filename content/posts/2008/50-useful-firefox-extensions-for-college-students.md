Heather Johnson, has published a nice list of more than 50 firefox extensions for college students.

For easier navigation, the list is divided into categories&#8230;

  * Research
  * Note Taking
  * Reference
  * General
  * Productivity
  * Fun

Looking at extensions included in the list, it seems Heather has taken lots of efforts while searching for them. So if you are a college student don&#8217;t forget to check this list. Its good to use your PC once in a while for studying&#8230; ðŸ˜‰
