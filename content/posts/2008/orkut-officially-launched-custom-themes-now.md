Long time back I wrote about greasemonkey scripts and [userstyle themes][1] for [changing orkut background][2]. Over the time as orkut changed many of those themes stopped working, but now orkut officially launched few orkut themes and more will be added soon. One such theme I like is shown at the top. More themes can be seen at <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/05/yeah-baby-orkut-officially-launches.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/05/yeah-baby-orkut-officially-launches.html', 'orkut plus']);" >orkut plus</a>.

I guess Orkut is rolling this feature to few people at a time. So if you don&#8217;t see it then just wait. Even I can&#8217;t see it. <a href="http://www.insideorkut.com/2008/05/google-launches-orkut-themes-but-none.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.insideorkut.com/2008/05/google-launches-orkut-themes-but-none.html', 'Darnell']);" >Darnell</a> also reports the same problem. He also asked a nice question as why don&#8217;t orkut create a theme directory where users can create and upload their own theme. I think this is a great suggestion and orkut will surely listen to it.

Once enabled, you can switch between different themes by going to Edit Profile option. Themes are available at <a href="http://www.orkut.com/editskin.aspx?ch=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/editskin.aspx?ch=1', 'this Orkut url']);" >this Orkut url</a>.

**Update:** <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/06/if-youre-in-india-and-feel-like-change.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2008/06/if-youre-in-india-and-feel-like-change.html', 'Official Orkut blog post']);" >Official Orkut blog post</a> says this themes are currently available for India. But a [greasemonkey script][3] is available which can make these themes work for you irrespective of your country. ([Read More&#8230;][3]) [June 2, 2008]
