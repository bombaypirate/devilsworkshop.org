Since our [exclusive][1] [coverage][2] of [iPhone][3] [launch][4], I was constantly receiving mails about iPhones&#8217; launch in India. As I promised in all replies, here is major update on the topic.

<span style="line-height: 19px"><img style="float:right" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/05/apple-iphone.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone.jpg" width="220" height="405" /></span>

Vodafone bagged the deal with Apple to sell iPhone in **Australia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Italy, India, Portugal, New Zealand, South Africa and Turkey**. The final date is not declared yet but launch will be near the end of this year.

As per Indian market goes, which is <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/04/26/stories/2008042651040400.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/04/26/stories/2008042651040400.htm', 'second largest mobile market in the world']);" >second largest mobile market in the world</a> with more than 261 million subscribers, this deal will be surely a major victory for Vodafone. Vodafone entered into Indian mobile market quite late considering their global presence. But with iPhone deal in the bag, they can hope to get return on their investment little earlier.

Unlocked iPhones are doing rounds in Indian grey market from few months. They cost around INR 20000 (~ $500). But I will strongly recommend you to wait for official launch than falling for grey market iPhones. As with Apple products, one really enjoys the support they give, of course that mean paying a little more, but its worth it!

**Update: **Another Indian telecom operator signed deal with Apple to bring iPhone in India. This will surely affect Vodafone Sales in India but as a consumer we will have more options. Details are [here][5]&#8230;
