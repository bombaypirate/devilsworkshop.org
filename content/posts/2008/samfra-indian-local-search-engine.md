Samfra is a local search engine made for India. Currently it provides local search facility in 20 cities and movie search in 6 major cities.

### About Local Search&#8230;

Local search is to find places like ATM, banks, restaurants, hotels, clubs, etc in any of the 20 cities currently covered. It also allows users to write reviews, view maps and give ratings to their favorite places. User can also edit details of a place if he find some mistake.

Select your city from drop-down menu and just type name of a shop or a service. You will get highly relevant result, fast & clean like Google. Below is screenshot of search results, when I searched for <a href="http://www.samfra.com/search?q=pizza&city=Pune&btnS=Search?=en&source=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.samfra.com/search?q=pizza&city=Pune&btnS=Search?=en&source=', 'pizza in Pune']);" >pizza in Pune</a>.
