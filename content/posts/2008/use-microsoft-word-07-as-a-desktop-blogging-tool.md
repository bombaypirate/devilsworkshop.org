  Few moments ago, while using Microsoft Word 2007 I found it strange that <strong>there is an inbuilt option in Word 07 to use it as a desktop blogging tool</strong>. Personally I prefer <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/windows-live-writer-best-desktop-blogging-client-for-offline-blogging/">Windows Live Writer</a> (WLW) as a desktop blogging client, but making use of Word 07 too is not a bad idea, as Ms-Office is pre installed in almost all Windows systems and you need not install WLW which also requires <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/download-complete-microsoft-net-framework-35-setup/">.NET Framework</a> to be pre-installed. Also this is good for blogger who does not blog too often.

  Even I tried writing an article on my <a href="http://mobilegyaan.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mobilegyaan.com', 'blog']);" >blog</a> using Word and found that it is as simple and convenient as WLW. If you too want to blog using MS Word 07 just follow these simple procedure:
</p>

  * <div>
      Open MS Word and hit the office button on the top left corner.
    </div>

  * <div>
      Go to New-> Blank & Recent-> New blog post
    </div>

  * <div>
      Use &#8216;Manage Account&#8217; option on blog tool bar (pointed out on the image) to configure your online account
    </div>

  * <div>
      Just enter your contents and hit &#8216;Publish&#8217;
    </div>

  * <div>
      Instead you can even save an article as a draft on your weblog to edit it later from a remote computer.
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  That is all what it takes to blog using Word 2007. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> As said earlier if you do not blog very often, than this is the best option available for you.
