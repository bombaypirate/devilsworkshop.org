Recently, I came across an <a href="http://pcworld.in/india/news/5800022/Communications/Google_Earth_Used_by_Terrorists_in_India_Attacks" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pcworld.in/india/news/5800022/Communications/Google_Earth_Used_by_Terrorists_in_India_Attacks', 'article']);" >article</a> in PcWorld which revealed, according to investigations terrorists used Google Earth to get familiar with streets of Mumbai and learn the roads around them during recent Mumbai attacks. Everyone knows, with growing technologies there must be some disadvantages too, but such a heavy loss to the national heritage and resources can ever be compensated by these technologies that make our life easier<strong>? </strong>It is really a big question..

  Don&#8217;t know what exactly Indian government is going to do after such a heavy loss of life and resources of the country. But I am sure that these scary situations will bring some problems for the launch of India based satellite mapping service &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/isro-bhuvan-to-be-google-earths-competitor/">ISRO Bhuvan</a>&#8220;.
