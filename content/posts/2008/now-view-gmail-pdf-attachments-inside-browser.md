Next time when you get an Email on your Google mail account with a PDF attachment in it, you need not bother downloading it just for having a single look. Using the recently <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/fast-pdf-viewing-right-in-your-browser.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/fast-pdf-viewing-right-in-your-browser.html', 'announced']);" target="_blank">announced</a> &#8220;PDF viewing in browser&#8221; option for Gmail users, just as you view image file attachments, you can view PDF attachments as well. As shown on the image below, you can click on the &#8220;View&#8221; option (instead of &#8220;Download&#8221;) to view the PDF file right on your browser without needing to waste up a lot of bandwidth to download the whole file. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Just have look on the image below, which will make you clear on how the whole thing will work for you.
