    Many amongst us store documents online and I am sure a lot of you use various applications to compress files together into .rar or .zip files.  I want to share with you a website which does the file compressing on the website itself and hence there is no need for a application to be present on your computer for creating zip files.

Many amongst us store documents online and I am sure a lot of you use various applications to compress filesÂ togetherÂ into **.rar** or **.zip** files. Â I want to share with you a website which does the file compressing on the website itself and hence there is no need for a application to be present on your computer for creating zip files.

<a href="http://filetac.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://filetac.com', '']);" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17803" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Compress files online" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/compress_filesonline1.png" alt="Compress files online" width="500" height="378" /></a>

  * Visit the website <a href="http://filetac.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://filetac.com/', 'Filetac']);" >Filetac</a> and click on **Zip Files** option as shown in the above image.
  * In manage if you click on **Add field**, the number of files that can be uploaded can be increased. The maximum number of files you can upload are 30 files and each file has a size restriction of 10 MB.
  * Once you load all the times click on **Compress** and it creates a zip file for you to download. Download this file which has compressed the files you wanted. ðŸ˜‰

I think a lot of websites will start offering such services. Files can be uploaded and downloaded much faster than they used to be. People are looking into a future where speeds of 100 megs (100 Mbps) could be a possibility in 5 to 10 years. This might make hosting and processing files online a more common phenomena compared to today.

Go ahead and try out Filetac and tell me through your comments if you know about other such services. ðŸ˜‰
