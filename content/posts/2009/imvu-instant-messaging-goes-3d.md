Just like an old-school text-based messenger, you <a href="http://imvu.com/catalog/web_download_steps.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://imvu.com/catalog/web_download_steps.php', 'download IMVU&#8217;s software']);" >download IMVU&#8217;s software</a> onto your PC. But with IMVU you create your own avatars who chat in animated 3D scenes. <a href="http://imvu.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://imvu.com/', '']);" ></a>

<a href="http://imvu.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://imvu.com/', 'Check it out']);" >Check it out</a> and experience 3D chat for yourself!

## Choose your Avatar

In this &#8216;new&#8217; type of Instant Messaging, you choose your avatar and do shopping to make it uniquely you! Joining is, of course, free. But, if you want to do virtual shopping, hang out with 3D buddies etc. , you might have to lighten your pocket.

## Download

You will get a download link as you <a href="http://www.imvu.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imvu.com', 'register for IMVU']);" >register for IMVU</a>. Like most other software providers, this gives you first a downloader, then the downloader will download the full software for you. This poses trouble if you are on a slow connection and prefer using a Download Manager(to resume downloads). No problem, because you are on DW, you will get more than just info.

<a href="http://static.imvu.com/imvufiles/installers/InstallIMVU_411.0_full.exe" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://static.imvu.com/imvufiles/installers/InstallIMVU_411.0_full.exe', 'Get the complete IMVU']);" >Get the complete IMVU</a>(Direct Link).

If you prefer know more about it first, <a href="http://www.imvu.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imvu.com', 'go for it']);" >go for it</a>.

## **Drawbacks**

We aren’t promoting anything, so **its drawbacks…**

  * Too slow for most dial-up and even some broadband users.
  * Heavy program. Consumes a lot of RAM, leaving none for other programs, hence hangs a lot.

But, still it&#8217;s cool! After all, it&#8217;s fun to chat 3-Dimensional!

Will IMVU bring a revolution like XMPP(Jabber) did? You decide.
