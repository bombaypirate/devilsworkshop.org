  If the rumors floating around the world of Internet is correct, Nokia, one of the largest manufacturer and seller of mobile devices in the world may soon enter into the computing sector too (specially laptop manufacturing).&#160; Actually, recently Nokia chief executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo during an interview to Finnish national broadcaster YLE disclosed about these plans by Nokia.

  Though there is no such official information about Nokia entering laptop market, but this news may be treated as correct to some extent because it has been passed over from the mouth of Nokia’s Chief Executive who is among one of the top officials in a company.

We don&#8217;t have to look even for five years from now to see that what we know as a cell phone and what we know as a PC are in many ways converging.

### What made Nokia consider jumping into laptop market?

Recently we saw some of the PC manufacturers [jumping over to the cell phone bandwagon][1]. Though Acer announced launch of some of its smart phones last week, there is no official information about Dell entering into smart phone business but even Dell is said to be planning to manufacture smart phones. So, this initiative by Nokia (to manufacture laptops) could be a reply by Nokia to those trying to reduce its market share in cell phone industry.

Its just a matter of time that will bring the fact on the screen!!
