CricTalks is for all cricket fans as its name suggests but unlike other cricket blogs where you are just a spectator, here you can actively share your views. Continuing community spirit Devils Workshop, CricTalks is open to all contributors from Day 1!

## Writer&#8217;s Eleven&#8230;

Since Cricket is much lighter topic than technology, we decided to relax writing guidelines that we strictly force at Devils Workshop.

Technically, all **&#8220;contributors&#8221;** can write but their posts need approval from **&#8220;editor&#8221;** before publishing. On the other hand, **&#8220;authors&#8221;** can write and publish their posts at their will without any intervention form editors or admins.

To encourage contribution, we decided to give **&#8220;author&#8221;** privilege to 11 contributors!

### More on the way&#8230;

We missed our launch date which was earlier planned to coincide IPL2&#8217;s start date. We have some exciting features, sections and more on the way.

**Feedback Please&#8230;.**

Please send you suggestion, comments, etc. We love cricket like most of you, but this is the first time we are trying hands on something non-technical.

We hope to nice contribution form community! Enjoy IPL and CricTalks! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
