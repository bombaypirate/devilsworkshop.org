A new website called <a href="http://www.dustytunes.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dustytunes.com/', 'Dusty Tunes']);" >Dusty Tunes</a> makes it easy to do just that. It is a FREE online service and very easy to use.

With Dusty Tunes, you can create your own personal web page automatically, with a list of all the music in your iTunes library and other sources. It will organize the XML data into a list and then provide you with the links so that you could share your music further with your friends on blogs, forums, websites, digg, and social networking sites like Facebook.

Within the website you can browse user’s collections and when possible preview and buy tracks via iTunes. If you can&#8217;t find anything you like in other people&#8217;s lists, then you can use the ‘Tune Search’ feature to search for specific items. You could also comeback to the website again and update your page with all your recent favorites.
