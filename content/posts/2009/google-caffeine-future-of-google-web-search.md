It&#8217;s the first step in a process that will push the envelope on size, indexing speed, accuracy, comprehensiveness and other dimensions.

The new infrastructure sits &#8220;under the hood&#8221; of Google&#8217;s search engine, which means that most users won&#8217;t notice a difference in search results. But web developers and power searchers might notice a few differences.

This new search tool (codenamed: Caffeine) is functional and a pre-beta release of it is available at <a href="http://www2.sandbox.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www2.sandbox.google.com/', 'www2.sandbox.google.com']);" target="_blank">www2.sandbox.google.com</a>. My overall take on Caffeine is as follows:

  1. Speed and Index size is definitely an improvement. In some cases, the results are returned in half the time with almost double the number of estimated results.** **
  2. Search is more real-time with Caffeine. When queried for names of individuals, one can clearly view the latest Twitter updates too. This is in clear response to capture the &#8216;breaking news&#8217; market where FaceBook and Twitter (and even Bing) are trying their hands at.
  3. There seems to be a major tweak in the keyword matching algorithm which is good for searchers, but makes it even more difficult for SEO professionals to catch up.

In the coming week, I will do a more detailed and a hands on review of this tool and post my observations.
