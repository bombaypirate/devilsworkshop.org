What good is any information if you can’t seem to find it at the right time? With billions of documents floating around, it’s always been a challenge for various organizations (big or small) across the globe to figure out ways to navigate through complex systems. After years of hard work trying to meet this challenge, Google announced the launch of their latest version of the Google Search Appliance, GSA 6.0 today.

The Google Search Appliance (GSA) is a fast, relevant search for any website or intranet, with the capacity to search billions of documents. Even if the content is scattered around in different departments, locations, continents, formats and languages, GSA can still make searching simple by providing a unified set of results to the end-user.

> *“Imagine there is a database that might “live” in Egypt, some documents in a data center in Sydney, and a fileshare whose homebase is Los Angeles. The new GSA 6.0 integration can handle searching through all those data stores and give the employee who is looking a simple page of search results – one that looks as easy to use as Google.com – even though the backend search is really complicated.”*
