  Mozilla Labs has another beauty in the works. It is a service that will allow your Firefox browser through an add-on to sync with other Firefox browsers across desktops and mobile phones.
  
  Basically you can now access your Firefox browser's  history, bookmarks, tabs, forms,  preferences and passwords from anywhere.

### How does Weave work?

  * What Weave does is stores information from your Firefox browser to a cloud or a server and it can be downloaded or be in sync with your Firefox browser on another computer or mobile phone.
  * Bookmarks saved at a computer at home can be accessed from the computer at work by syncing the browsers with the Weave server.
  * Continuation of work on a browser will be much easier. You have a tab open at one computer then it will be open on the other location because the Weave server keeps them both synchronized.
  * A cool part of this is add-on is that it allows you to save passwords and then sync it with your mobile phone&#8217;s browser. That is very handy as sometimes it is difficult for mobile users to enter complex passwords. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Firefox&#8217;s Weave is available on Firefox 3.5 and upwards. It is still a beta project and being developed further with an eye to being a stable feature for [Firefox 4 which will be released next year][1].
