Recently, one of our reader Jo has emailed us asking,

> Is there anyway to save orkut topics or download topics/forums to view offline   
> later when there is no internet connection?

As a temporary and *ugly *workaround, I suggested him,

> You can subscribe to RSS feed of individual topics and/or communities using our service <a href="http://www.orkutfeeds.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutfeeds.com/', 'Orkutfeeds']);" >Orkutfeeds</a>.   
> Then using [Google Readerâ€™s offline mode][1] or any desktop reader, you can view updates later when there is no internet connection.

But what really struck my mind was possibility of using Google Gears to access for Orkut communities offline. Something, which will look like belowâ€¦

Even though Orkutâ€™s long list of bugs and broken features stole all the limelight, many Orkut communities are really useful for their members. Moreover some communities have high volume of information exchange, so it is obvious for guys like Jo to not have enough time to go through them online.

It would be really great, if you can read updates from your communities offline using Google Gears. Moreover, people can reply to topics offline and then everything get synced automatically once internet connection becomes available.

This is just a suggestion, we are passing to Orkut. Do not wonder about screenshot. It is mock up we have created! ðŸ˜‰

By the way, do you think is this a good idea? Will you use it?
