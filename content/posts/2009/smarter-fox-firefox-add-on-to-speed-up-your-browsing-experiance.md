<a href="http://smarterfox.com/features/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://smarterfox.com/features/', 'Smarter Fox']);" >Smarter Fox</a> is a **Firefox browser** **add-on **which does exactly what it claims. It makes your browser a lot more smarter. It quickens up the browsingÂ experienceÂ a lot but giving the user a host of options to search and lookup information.

### Smarter Fox Features

  * **Awesomebar: **This is aÂ enhancedÂ version of Bookmarks. If you want to go to a particular page just press **Ctrl + Spacebar. **There is a screen that pops up with all the websites you can visit in a click of a button. To add yourÂ favoriteÂ website into the **Awesomebar **just drag and drop the link from the address bar. It will be added automatically. ðŸ˜‰
  * The **pop up bubble** is another great feature. Just highlight any text and bubble pops up with symbols of Google, Twitter, Wikipedia. Click on the symbol and a page opens after searching with the relevant service.

*Example of Pop-up bubble using Fastest Fox.*

  * Finally just start typing in your address bar and search results are shown in the address bar drop down itself. No need for search engine page to load hence saving me time. ðŸ˜‰
