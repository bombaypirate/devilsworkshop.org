### How much does Wufoo cost?

  * A monthly plan ranges from $9.95/month to $199.95/month. The price is based on 
      * The number of users that you can manage
      * The number of forms you might need
      * The number of entries you can have submitted per month
      * The amount of disk space you can use for handling files, etc.
  * You could also use the **FREE** version and create up to 3 forms. On free accounts, forms will be deactivated once the maximum number of entries allowed for a given month have been exceeded.
