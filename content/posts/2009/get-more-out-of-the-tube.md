Also, it&#8217;s a great time pass watching videos and tutorials, but very few use this effectively&#8230;

## **Simple Commands in Youtube**

There are lot short commands that are very useful in Youtube that can be suffixed at the end of your video URL to enjoy their functionality

> Suffix
> 
> ‘&fmt=18? for high quality videos
> 
> #t=XXmYYs for XX mins and YY seconds using this you can view video from exact time you want for example if you want to view your video from 2min 22 sec the command you should use is
> 
> #t=02m22s
> 
> ‘&rel=0? &#8211; to disable related videos

Well, these are good but i personally find them very irritating and absurd as you need to do it manually every time you watch any videos.

The good news is there are scripts and addons available for it.

## **Greasemonkey Scripts**

If you aren&#8217;t aware of what spices of monkey I am talking about better check this post and proceed ahead.

### <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13333" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13333', 'YousableTubeFix']);" >YousableTubeFix</a><a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13333" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13333', ' ']);" > </a>

A good all-in-one script that blocks ads from the sections you want, lets you download videos into several formats, automatically expand the “More” section, see all comments at once and more.

This script does the job at once but there are few more that are useful

### <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/19701" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/19701', 'Video Focus']);" target="_blank">Video Focus</a>

Allows you to watch videos without the distractions of chats, comments, ads and so on, while also giving you the ability to resize videos, customize the background color, center the video on the page and more.  Works with dozens of different video sites.

### <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8345" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8345', 'YouTube Cleaner']);" target="_blank">YouTube Cleaner</a>

Helps you clean up the appearance of the YouTube video pages by removing the comments, related videos, promoted videos, sharing information and footer. Also allows you to restore them instantly if you should choose to do so.

## **Mozilla Addons**

There are plenty of Firefox addons that helps to improve Youtube experience but i would mention only a few which i personally use and are useful.

### <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8189" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8189', 'Media Converter']);" >Media Converter</a>

This extension will allow you to not only download your desired videos, but it will also convert them right in the browser to the format you desire.

### <a href="http://www.downloadhelper.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.downloadhelper.net/', 'Video DownloadHelper']);" target="_blank">Video DownloadHelper</a>

Once installed, Video DownloadHelper’s icon will animate when you come to a page that has a video you can download.  Once you start the download process, you can also choose which format you want to save the file as.

### <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/better-youtube-firefox-extension-319925.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/better-youtube-firefox-extension-319925.php', 'Better YouTube']);" target="_blank">Better YouTube</a>
