<img class="size-full wp-image-4619 alignright" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/paypal_logo.jpg" alt="paypal_logo" width="188" height="167" />This post will for all Indian residents who regularly use <a href="http://www.paypal.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paypal.com', 'PayPal']);" >PayPal</a> for sending or receiving money.

For adding funds in your PayPal account & lifting limits you would need a credit card. But as we all know not everyone is interested in having a credit card or some people are ineligible to be issued a credit card. A credit card can only be issued to a person above 18years of age and earning regular income.

### First why not use Virtual Credit Card (VCC)&#8230;

Many people to use a Virtual Credit Card (VCC). But I don&#8217;t recommend it because the purpose of the PayPal verification is to validate your personnel information. Their goal is to verify the information given by you is correct. VCC&#8217;s cheat the system and do so in such a way that compromises the entire network. So even if you were able to verify using VCC, there is constant risk that PayPal might detect it and freeze your account. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t recommend using a Virtual Credit Card (VCC).

## Use E-wallet by ICICI Bank

E-wallet is a VISA card issued by ICICI bank. It works exactly like a normal credit card and it is accepted on all online stores(including PayPal). It would be issued under your name.  You will also get regular online statements for it.

**It is different from a normal debit/credit as:**

  1. you won&#8217;t get a physical card.
  2. you have to fill it before doing any transaction via B2 Internet Banking. It works like a prepaid debit VISA card

### How to Get an E-wallet

E-wallet service is a Part of ICICI b2 saving account. For getting E-wallet service you have to Apply for a B2 account.

**Eligibility and charges:** Its a free service without any charges and is available to all Indian residents. b2 account is also a zero balance account, so do not worry about minimum balance.

### Verifying PayPal with E-wallet

  1. After your b2 account is activated *(it takes 10-15 days)* and you have moved money into this account via NEFT or Cheque deposit, login into your account. In summary tab, Under E-wallet Section click on **&#8220;Allocate Funds&#8221;**.
