Have you ever seen comments like &#8220;Good Post&#8221;, &#8220;very good, keep it up&#8221;, &#8220;nice&#8221;, &#8220;Good work&#8221;, etc. on your blog ?

I bet many of you would have certainly experienced such poor commenting and those who moderate their comments might not have allowed them to be posted !

These are known as **Broken Comments, **which have been posted just for the sake of getting back links! Usually you will get such annoying replies on sites with good page ranks. Before writing this post, I was reading an article of one of the famous pro bloggers&nbsp; and noticed that out of the Top 5 comments, 2 were broken.

The &#8216;creators&#8217; of such comments may have posted them with the view to draw huge traffic, however, I don&#8217;t think people will ever want to visit the site of such a blogger, who gives a damn about the article and instead is focused on generating traffic for himself. And personally speaking, I hate such meaningless comments!!

If you have got nothing to say and still want to thank him, then thank the author through Twitter or Facebook, instead of writing one line comments with no meaning. If you really want to get attention, then a quality comment is a must. Not only will good comments attract readers,&nbsp; it will also encourage them to interact with you. Getting them interested in your views and way of thinking will definitely encourage them to visit your site and who knows, they might turn into regular visitors.

However, I am not denying the fact that some of them are genuine too, but most&nbsp; of the time the motive is something else. In short, to sum up, fake comments lack sincerity and are only meant to drive traffic and are nothing more than ( set of ) rigmarole.

Commenting is a powerful tool and should therefore be used carefully.
