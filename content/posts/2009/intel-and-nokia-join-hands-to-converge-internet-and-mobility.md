Endless possibilities.

Intel and Nokia announced yesterday a strategic relationship to shape the next era of mobile computing innovation. This means that we could now think beyond the existing smartphones, netbooks and notebooks.

## The next era of mobile computing innovation

Both companies are looking to develop a new class of Intel Architecture-based mobile computing device and chipset architectures which will combine the performance of powerful computers with high-bandwidth mobile broadband communications and ubiquitous Internet connectivity.

## Product plans

Although it is too early for the companies to talk about product plans, but people could expect possible development of a variety of innovative hardware, software and mobile Internet services in the time to come.

> **Says Anand Chandrasekher, Intel Corporation senior vice president and general manager, Ultra Mobility Group: **
> 
> *“This Intel and Nokia collaboration unites and focuses many of the brightest computing and communications minds in the world, and will ultimately deliver open and standards-based technologies, which history shows drive rapid innovation, adoption and consumer choice. With the convergence of the Internet and mobility as the team&#8217;s only barrier, I can only imagine the innovation that will come out of our unique relationship with Nokia. The possibilities are endless.”*
> 
> **Says Kai Öistämö, Executive Vice President, Devices, Nokia:**
> 
> *“Today&#8217;s announcement represents a significant commitment to work together on the future of mobile computing, and we plan to turn our joint research into action. We will explore new ideas in designs, materials and displays that will go far beyond devices and services on the market today. This collaboration will be compelling not only for our companies, but also for our industries, our partners and, of course, for consumers.”*

## Open-source mobile Linux software projects

Both Intel and Nokia would center around several open-source mobile Linux software projects, including the Moblin platform for Atom-based processors and the Maemo operating system developed by Nokia.

## License

Intel will also acquire a license from Nokia that is used in modem chips to connect to third generation cellular networks.
