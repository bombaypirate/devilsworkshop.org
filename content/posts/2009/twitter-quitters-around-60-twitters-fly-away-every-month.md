Twitter’s monthly user retention rate is just 40%. In other words, of all the Twitter users in a particular month, about 60% of them do not return the following month. The data was released recently by Nielsen Online- an Internet traffic research service.

### The Pattern

If you take a closer look at this chart that compares Twitter loyalty against Facebook and MySpace loyalties, you will observe that the 40% retention is, in fact, the maximum when plotted against the internet reach. Nielsen research also suggests that for the last one year, the retention rate has been hanging below 30%.

### The significance

As per Nielson, the retention rate of 40% will limit the site&#8217;s growth to a 10% reach figure, over a period of time. See the chart below for details:
