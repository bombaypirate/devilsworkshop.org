### Difference between Freedom and Free.

  * There is a difference in perceptions on what is Free Software. The idea is to bring promote free ideas rather than free products.
  * Current laws are slightly unfair to open source software products because when a &#8216;Paid Software&#8217; applies for a patent it assumes the idea to be original and rights are reserved.
  * This means that the idea is unwittingly patented rather than the product and that inhibits any other developer.
  * Finally the free software attempts to stop paid softwares as industry standards and hence level the playing field for software developers.
