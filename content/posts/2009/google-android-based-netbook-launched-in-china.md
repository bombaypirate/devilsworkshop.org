Sooner than anticipated by market watchers world over, Google Android on a Netbook, is now available.

Today morning, I [posted][1] about the recent Netbook market trends and how ASUS is developing a netbook based on Googleâ€™s Android platform. But leaving ASUS and others behind in the race, itâ€™s a Chinese manufacturer &#8211; Skytone that has won the race.

## **Features:**

Based on ARM-II 533MHz CPU, Skytoneâ€™s Alpha 680 netbook fancies a 7-inch flip-around display and is available in a variety of colors including Pink, Yellow and Red.

With only 1 GB of built-in solid-state memory, the built-in SD/MMC card slot shall come in handy.

I wonder how Yahoo got the view print in this official image release by Skytone.

Not to forget, the Skytone Alpha 680 Android netbook is expected to be priced in the range of $100 to $200. Letâ€™s wait and see if the machine gets its way to India from China, before it could reach the US! I wish it does ðŸ˜›
