Downloading from swarms however has a negative side. The download speed may be capped, there are port forwarding issues. Upload is mandatory and you may not have a good seeders to peers ratio.<!--more-->

Using <a href="http://g2p.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://g2p.org/', 'G2P.org']);" target="_blank">G2P.org</a> (a take on P2P &#8211; stands for Google-to-peer) allows you to search the web (via Google) for files you want. The concept behind it is simplicity itself &#8211; it uses [special search operators to search Google][1] for files you want in openly listed directories on Apache servers.

So you can search for songs, ebooks, softwares etc using G2P and get direct downloads! G2P is not a search engine but simply a frontend to one which makes searching for ’stuff’ easier. The data is hosted on by others listed in open directories; you may or may not find what you’re looking for. But for one off cases where you need to download something quickly without bothering about finding seeds it’s a great idea.
