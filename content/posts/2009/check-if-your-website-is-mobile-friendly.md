If someone says &#8216;**the internet**&#8216; our minds immediately pulls up an image of someone on a PC or a Notebook. Hence the priority of website design is usually on how a person using a PC or Notebook might perceive it. A report suggests that over 20 Million people access websites through their mobile devices every single day.

  * Mobile Validator is an online tool which can help you find out, how mobile friendly is a particular website. Just visit the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/mobile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://validator.w3.org/mobile/', 'Validator W3C website']);" >Validator W3C website</a> and enter the URL and click on **Check**.
  * It will carry out a bunch of tests and show results on if the website is mobile friendly or not.

I tested some popular websites with **<a href="http://validator.w3.org/mobile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://validator.w3.org/mobile/', 'Mobile Validator']);" >Mobile Validator</a>****.**

**<a href="http://www.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com', 'Google.com']);" >Google.com</a>**

**<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17066" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/mobileok_check2.png" alt="mobileok_check2" width="500" height="167" />**

This test proves the **Google.com** should work absolutely fine being accessed with any mobile device. The image shows the results after the test.

**<a href="http://www.msn.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msn.com', 'MSN.com']);" >MSN.com</a>**

**<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17067" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/mobileok_check3.png" alt="mobileok_check3" width="540" height="56" />**

**MSN.com** is obviously not a URL which is mobile friendly. The result &#8220;This page is not mobile friendly&#8221; was actually surprising and I did not really expect MSN.com to fail the test.

**<a href="http://www.yahoo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.yahoo.com', 'Yahoo.com']);" >Yahoo.com</a>**

**<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17069" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/mobileok_check4.png" alt="mobileok_check4" width="550" height="38" />**

**Yahoo.com** when tested did much better than MSN. It scored a 93/100 3 tests failed out of 50. This does mean that some mobile devices might have issues viewing Yahoo.com

So if you have a website or a blog which you plan to make it available online, you might want to lookup <a href="http://validator.w3.org/mobile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://validator.w3.org/mobile/', 'Mobile Validator']);" >Mobile Validator</a> to carry out certain benchmarks for the website.
