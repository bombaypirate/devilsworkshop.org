I have not really been a recipient of &#8216;Spam &#8216;inundating my Twitter account. But I can imagine if you are following people in hundreds it can be really difficult to really weed out the spammers.

Twitter yesterday announced a new tool that will help them deal with accounts that spread spam.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15842" style="border: 1px solid grey" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/10/twitterspam.png" alt="twitterspam" width="289" height="180" />

### How does &#8220;Report for Spam&#8221; work?

  * Its simple, you need to visit the profile page of the person who is spamming and report the person for Spam.
  * Twitter does not block the account. It reviews the account and checks if this is actually being used for spamming and then take action.
  * Once you Report the account for spamming, automatically that account cannot send you messages or follow you. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Twitter seems to be steadily improving and with a expected roll out of the options for organizing Tweets into [lists][1], this enhancement of dealing with spammers is a welcome sign.

**Note:** In the Image I used Deepak Jain&#8217;s profile. He is by no means a spammer and is a very respectable blogger along with being a Editor for DW.:-)
