<img class="alignleft wp-image-51178" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/04/image10.png" alt="" width="200" height="62" />I think a lot of our readers may have used <a href="http://www.digsby.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.digsby.com/', 'Digsby']);" >Digsby</a> or atleast read about it. It has been reviewed a couple of times in the past on Devils Workshop. I have recently started using Digsby and I am hooked on to it. It has a simple, clean and easy to use user-interface along with a lot of really neat features.

### Overview ofÂ Digsby

  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">For readers who may not be aware of <strong>Digsby</strong> it is a desktop application which allows you to manage multiple <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/digsby-manage-all-your-im-email-and-social-network-accounts-from-one-place/">Instant Messenger, Email and Social Networking</a> accounts at one place. Previously when we reviewed the software it did not have <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/digsby-im-email-social-networks-recommended-app/">support of Mac or Linux Operating System</a> but now it isÂ availableÂ on both. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">It does force you to create a Digsby account and this is where it is different from other desktop applications as the accounts you manage from with <strong>Digsby</strong> are stored on a server and hence available on different computers.</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">I downloaded and tried a few things with it. <a href="http://www.digsby.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.digsby.com/', 'Digsby']);" >Digsby</a> has <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/digsby-integrated-facebook-chat-support-for-lastfm-flickr-digg-on-the-way/">integrated Facebook Chat</a> into its software which is very useful. This means I do not need to keep a browser window open to chat with my Facebook friends. ðŸ˜‰</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">It allowed me to keep a <strong>Gobal Status</strong> which is put up across all the accounts I have selected. </span>

Below is a video from <a href="http://www.digsby.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.digsby.com', 'Digsby']);" >Digsby</a> giving a view into its features and usability. Watch it and let me know what do you think about it through your comments.
