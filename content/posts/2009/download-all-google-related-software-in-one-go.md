If you are a fan of Google products (*I must say its getting increasingly hard to come across someone who is not*) you might be using Google related software on your computer. As I am about to buy a new computer, I was looking up what is new that Google has to offer. **Google Pack** is a nice one stop shop to download various Google related software you might want to download in one go.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18107" title="Google Pack" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/google_pack1.png" alt="Google Pack" width="232" height="247" />

### About <a href="http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html', 'Google Pack']);" >Google Pack</a>

  * Visit the <a href="http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html', 'Google Pack page']);" >Google Pack page</a>, and look up which Google affiliated software is missing on your computer.
  * You can check which one you want installed and start downloading.
  * Google Pack includes Chrome browser, Google Earth, Google Talk, Google Apps, Google Desktop, Picassa, Real Player, Adobe Reader, Google Toolbar for Firefox and Internet Explorer and Skype.
  * All these software applications can be downloaded from just once installation if you are using a **Windows OS**.
  * If you are using a **Mac**, you might want to check out their <a href="http://www.google.com/mac/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/mac/', 'Mac page']);" >Mac page</a> which also is a one stop page to download various mac related Google applications.

Try it out and let me know what you think about Google Pack through your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
