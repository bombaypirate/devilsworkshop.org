**Google** has got a lot of press and attention in the last few days thanks to it launching [Google Public DNS][1]. Amidst all the discussions about the pros and cons of Public DNS, Google has quietly released <a href="http://www.google.com/dictionary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/dictionary', 'Google Dictionary']);" >Google Dictionary</a>.

<a href="http://www.google.com/dictionary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/dictionary', '']);" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17738" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Google Dictionary" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/google_dictionary.png" alt="Google Dictionary" width="550" height="339" /></a>

  * It has some very good features and would be a extremely good tool for someone who is learning a new language. In the above image I searched for a slang word &#8216;**Fanstastical**&#8216;
  * The results were very impressive. It showed me how the word was derived from **Fanstastic**. It also has support for translating these words from English to another language and vice versa.
  * If you are learning a new language like say German or French, you can simply type in the German word and select German Dictionary from the drop down and look up the word.
  * Just like we can mark an mail within **Gmail** as important with a star, the same principle has been extended with Dictionary. You can select **star** for the words you find important and can refer to them later on with using **starred words**.

Try out <a href="http://www.google.com/dictionary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/dictionary', 'Google Dictionary']);" >Google Dictionary</a> and let me know what you think about it through your comments.
