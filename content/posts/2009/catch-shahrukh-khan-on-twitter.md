<img class="wp-image-54210" style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/shahrukhkhan.jpg" border="0" alt="Shahrukh Khan" width="150" height="192" align="right" /> Few days ago, there were rumors around the web that, L K Advani â€“ One of the most popular and eminent Indian political leader has now <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/politics-in-india-goes-hi-tech-advani-starts-blogging-tweeting/" target="_blank">adopted Twitter</a> to directly interact with people and attract them towards his party. But later on it turned out that, some one was playing prank and created a fake account disguising himself as L K Advani.

Now our dear Shahrukh Khan â€“ Famous bollywood star, too have come up with a twitter account and following & getting followed by many people in the twitter world. But it is yet to be confirmed that this account is really being used by Shahrukh Khan, or again some one is playing prank as in the case of <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/politics-in-india-goes-hi-tech-advani-starts-blogging-tweeting/" target="_blank">@lkadvani</a>. I came to know about the presence of Shahrukh Khan in Twitter about 2-3 days ago, but I avoided writing about it recalling <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/politics-in-india-goes-hi-tech-advani-starts-blogging-tweeting/" target="_blank">@lkadvaniâ€™s</a> story, but the huge amount of followers by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shahrukh_khan" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twitter.com/shahrukh_khan', '@shahrukh_khan']);" target="_blank">@shahrukh_khan</a> forced me to write about his presence in Twitter. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Hope, this time atleast the story turns out to be true. And if so, we can see a huge number of Indians (specially girls ðŸ˜‰ ) driving into twitter in the days to come. Isnâ€™t it?
