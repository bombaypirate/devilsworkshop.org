According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/press/bing-overtakes-yahoo/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/press/bing-overtakes-yahoo/', 'StatCounter Global Stats']);" >StatCounter Global Stats</a> (an Internet research firm that tracks page loads) [Bing][1] has surpassed Yahoo search in its very first week! This brings [Bing in the market with a bang][2] at number 2 slot on the list of top search engines worldwide.

## Statistics

As per the reports, here are some recent stats:

### In the US:

## Bing exceeds expectations!

Microsoft was expecting to see Bing at the second position in the search engine market within five years. This means Bing has greatly exceeded expectations so far, and Microsoft should be immensely happy with their product and [marketing and advertising strategies.][3]

## Can Bing hold on to the #2 slot?

Microsoft says that if Bing can manage to sustain the number-two slot, then they would successful achieve its goal four years earlier than expected. At this time, Bing would not be looking to compete against the dominant search player &#8211; Google for obvious reasons. Google has more than 80 % of the market worldwide and more than 70 % in the U.S.

Bing has some powerful features and is being handsomely marketed worldwide. Microsoft will be spending some $100 million on worldwide ad campaigning to promote Bing.

It looks like a possibility that Bing might just hold on to this position from here on!

At least I hope it does… I am slowly beginning to become a Bing fan! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
