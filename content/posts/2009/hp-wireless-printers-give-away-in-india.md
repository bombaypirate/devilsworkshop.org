### About HP Photosmart Wireless Printer

The great thing about a Photosmart Wireless Printer is that you can look up your photos online with the Printer&#8217;s LCD display. The pictures appear as thumbnails and you can select the one you want printed by touch screen.

If you need directions get on Google Maps with Photosmart and get printout of the map with directions using only the LCD display of the Printer.Â Another great feature of Photosmart is that there is no need to worry about printer settings while taking printouts. You can log on to wireless networks using Snapfish.
