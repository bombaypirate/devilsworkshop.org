I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://twitter.com/vaibhavkanwal" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/vaibhavkanwal', 'Twitter ']);" rel="nofollow">Twitter </a>for some 8 months now and recently joined <a href="http://meme.yahoo.com/vaibhavkanwal/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://meme.yahoo.com/vaibhavkanwal/', 'Yahoo Meme']);" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Meme</a>. Apart from micro blogging, just like most of us, I also happen to be on Facebook, FriendFeed and the likes.

Managing the above said services through dedicated Desktop/Mobile clients is becoming more and more time consuming just because of the sheer number of services they provide. We have so many new Microblogging/Social Networking sites that keeping track of all of them becomes difficult on a day-to-day basis.

      <a href="http://ping.fm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ping.fm', '']);" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://ping.fm/_images/layout/logo.gif" alt="Ping.fm" width="246" height="125" /></a>

      Ping.fm

  Here is where Ping.fm becomes into the picture. With Ping.fm you can link your social network together &#8211; post a Tweet, update your status, submit a meme ALL with just one click!
</p>

The status can be updated from virtually anywhere :

  * Through Email
  * Through IM
  * Browser &#8211; Web/Mobile
  * Mobile &#8211; SMS

Personally, I have a &#8216;Prosumer Light&#8217; plan on my BlackBerry which only allows me to send/receive unlimited email & chat. Though, I could use Twitter via TweetyMail and TwitPic, I was missing out on other micro-blogging networks such as Meme and sometimes even Facebook. Now all I do is Email or IM Ping.fm and the message is posted across all linked network. Useful, Quick and best of all FREE.

All you need is the access to internet and your social network will follow you everywhere.
