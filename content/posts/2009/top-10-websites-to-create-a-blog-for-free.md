Everyone starting from <a href="http://bigb.bigadda.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bigb.bigadda.com/', 'Amitabh Bachchan']);" target="_blank">Amitabh Bachchan</a> to me are blogging. Some blog for fashion and some for passion, some for interest and some for the thirst of money. Different people have different motives behind blogging. Today, I am sharing the **top 10 websites **with which you can **create a blog for free. **

Some websites gives user-friendly features, some others provide best SEO environment. So, you can select any service from the list below that suites you the most.

Let&#8217;s begin&#8230;

**1. <a href="http://blogger.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogger.com', 'Blogger']);" target="_blank">Blogger</a> :** Well, this website needs no introduction. Almost every new blogger starts from Blogger.com. If you want to start a new blog, I recommend you to go for Blogger.com. After gaining experience and skills you can then move to WordPress.

**2. <a href="http://wordpress.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.com', 'WordPress']);" target="_blank">WordPress</a> :** This is my second choice as a blogging platform. WordPress.com does not provide users to upload new themes, plugins and this is main drawback of using WordPress.com. Apart from this, if you are starting your blog for earning some bucks then I am extremely sorry, WordPress.com does not allow users to put any type of ads on their blog. If interested you can sign up your blog <a href="http://wordpress.com/signup/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.com/signup/', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>.

**3. <a href="http://weebly.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weebly.com', 'Weebly']);" target="_blank">Weebly</a> : ** One of the simplest website for you to create a blog. Just register an account, select your theme and start blogging. I have written a review on Weebly, <a href="http://www.beepthegeek.com/2009/01/best-tool-to-create-your-own-blog-or-site.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.beepthegeek.com/2009/01/best-tool-to-create-your-own-blog-or-site.html', 'click here']);" target="_blank">click here</a> to check it out.

**4. <a href="http://thoughts.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thoughts.com', 'Thoughts']);" target="_blank">Thoughts</a> :** Here is a 100% free website that will help you in creating a blog. It claims to have some extra features that you won´t find on other blog sites. This site provides unlimited bandwidth, photo, video and podcast sharing, community forums and live news discussions.
