We all know that Orkut is so popular in Brazil and most of the users of Orkut write their native country as &#8220;Brazil&#8221;. But did you know that Afghanistan is the seventh most popular country worldwide that uses Orkut? It&#8217;s so weird but this is correct, according to <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#MembersAll.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#MembersAll.aspx', 'Orkut&#8217;s demographics']);" target="_self">Orkut&#8217;s demographics</a>, Afghanistan is the seventh most popular country in the world.

Well the reason behind this is that &#8220;Afghanistan&#8221; word comes on the top in the list of countries if we consider alphabetically. Whenever a user makes a **fake** profile on Orkut, the person generally uses the first country that is &#8220;Afghanistan&#8221; as his native country. Mostly fake account uses this country and we all know that Orkut is full of fake profiles. So that actually makes orkut popular in Afghanistan. ðŸ˜‰
