Though this service is extremely useful, however it can also get your account spammed with unwanted followers.

## But How?

What happens is that whenever you search for certain names in Twitter search, the search activity is logged by other Twitter bots. The spammers then through these search activity, based on the topic they are looking for, get themselves to follow you and over a period of time may or may not attract other similar followers.

#### **For example:**

** **I searched for webhosting and within a day of searching this name, I was being followed by the people interested in webhosting ( I presume spammers ) and started getting replies for free web hosts.

## Block Spam!

Now that you know you are being followed by these spammer, you might want to get rid of them. This can be easily done by simply blocking them and restricting their access to your account by enabling **&#8216;Protect My Updates&#8217; **in **Settings tab. **

Many of you might also be thinking at the back of your mindÂ  &#8211;

#### **&#8221; Why the heck would you want to remove a follower ? &#8221; **

And my answer is WHY NOT?

  * I don&#8217;t think increasing your followers count with such spammers would do any good to you. What&#8217;s the point of having 2359 followers, out of which 1500 are spammers!
  * Secondly, you would only be encouraging spam.

Having said that, I would like to add that this was my personal experience and have no idea whether any of you have faced such a situation before!
