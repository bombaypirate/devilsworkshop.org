**Chrome 3.0** is available for download now as a stable version and is no longer in Beta.  
The release comes after 21 beta and 15 stable updates and is considered to be not just more stable than its predecessors but also much more fast.

It shows that now Google has confidence in its browsers to be released in a more wider base.

### What has changed in Chrome 3.0?

  * A better Omnibox. Omnibox helps users better search results and suggestions and increases the typign speed within the browser.

  * An improved JavaScript performance by 150% than its oldest beta version over a year ago.

  * A new Tab page which very closely resembles the Safari browser ðŸ˜‰

  * Allows you to delete the thumbnails of the recently visited pages which show up when you start the browser. Just hover over the thumbnail and option shows up to delete it. (See pic below)

  * It also allows the user to install and apply different themes for Google Chrome as seen in the pic below. I installed the Late Night theme <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Just Check out Options and Personal Stuff. You have the **Get Themes** button which when clicked takes your to various themes Chrome supports.

I really liked the Google Chrome browser ever since they released it in 2008. I have not really used any other browser since then and the new options make it only more worthwhile. It did sometimes crash once in a while but its been only a few hours since I made the upgrade and hence wont be fair to comment on that. All said and done I quite like Chrome 3.0
