According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/press/bing-gains-another-1-perc-of-search-market/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/press/bing-gains-another-1-perc-of-search-market/', 'comScore Global Stats']);" >comScore Global Stats</a> analysis, search engine Bing once again increased the Microsoft share of the US search market in July. Although the growth is minor from 8.23 % in June to 9.41 % in July, Microsoft will sure be happy to see the progress. Google continues to dominate the US search market quite easily with 77.54% in July, down from 78.48 % in June. This is despite Microsoft and Yahoo competition combined with 20.36% of the market, a slight increase from 19.27 % in June.
