This means that now you could get an iPhone 3G for just $99! Facing competition from Palm Pre, hopefully this would help broaden iPhone’s appeal to the masses.

It is being speculated that the sales would double up for iPhone due to the reduced prices in the US.

## [UPDATE]

## The $99 8GB iPhone dilemma!

**Please note** that this price band is applicable only in the US for now through AT&T.

### Why are iPhones exorbitantly priced in India?

Apple says that currently they want to keep exclusivity alive in the region and are not looking at a mass promotion of their iPhones in India. This means that that iPhone prices will continue to be high in India as compared to the US.

**Airtel will continue to sell**:

  * 8 GB iphone model (Black) for Rs 31000
  * 16 GB iphone model (White & Black) for Rs 36100

**Vodafone **would continue to sell these 2 versions at appx.Rs.1,500-2500 cheaper than Airtel rates. Both versions will be available only on exclusive 2 year contract with Vodafone.
