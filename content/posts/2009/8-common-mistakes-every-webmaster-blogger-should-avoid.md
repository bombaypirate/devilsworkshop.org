These are very common mistakes and everyone should avoid them. Hope you people like it.

### 1. Navigation

****

Now a days the webmasters are showing much interest in SEO (Search Engine Optimization). They  focus on optimizing thier websites for spiders like Google, Yahoo, etc. and forgot that humans also crawl their site. This focus often result in bad navigation system for their website.

### 2. Repeated Newsletters

Now a days what I am observing is the webmasters are flooding their visitors with a lot of newsletters. I mean to say 3 or more newsletters a day. It leads the visitors of your site to unsubscribe to your feed or newsletter. Ideally, even for a highly active blog/website, newsletters should be delivered not more than once a day.

### 3. Embed videos that start without playing the PLAY button

These option is called as auto play. We know most of the visitors have limited bandwidth. Additional video data you force your visitors to download gets directly transformed into anger they feel toward your site/blog. They most probably close your website rather than searching for a pause button.

### 4. Pop up message like &#8220;Subscribe us&#8221; or &#8220;Special offers&#8221;

This is the mistake made by new webmasters. These webmasters shower the visitors with pop ups. Whenever they see some new scripts on Internet, they use it in their websites. It irritates your users and also increases loading time of your site.

### 5. Show them big, uncompressed photos

Many webmasters show compressed photos on websites because it decreases the loading time as well as load on webserver. But some new bloggers often using MS-paint saves and upload photos in BMP format. Sometimes these uncompressed files are 10 time larger than their compressed JPG/PNG counterpart.

### 6. Changing the theme of your site every fortnight

With free WordPress themes and Blogger layout availble in abundance, resist the temptation of changing your theme regularly. If you want a new look do some minor changes in the theme but don&#8217;t change it completely every week or fortnight.

### 7. Not responding to comments

If you don’t have time to post timely replies to your visitors my suggestion is to better remove comments sections from your website. A repeat visitor will probably go away from your site if his comment remain unanswered after 24-48 hours.

### 8. Cluttered slow loading sites

Does your site load in 3-5 seconds? Otherwise remove all the useless widgets and change your theme to a normal one. Also remove the useless flash and javascripts from your website/blog.

Hope this post help you to recover from mistakes you might have made on your blogg or websites. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
