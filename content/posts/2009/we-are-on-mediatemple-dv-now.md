**Update:** [Why Dreamhost PS is a Pathetic Server – 5 Reasons][1]

* * *It has been more than 24 hours since we have shifted to MediaTemple. Everything seems to be working fine on the new host.</p> 

There are many minor tasks that are still pending so I will answer questions like, why we moved to MediaTemple, later.

This post is to make few **important** announcements&#8230;

### 1. For our readers/contributors

You guys can post comments and articles now. During migration (or may be just before that) we had a mysql crash which made us lost 4-5 comments and I guess 2-3 posts pending for review.

So comments and posts made (draft and pending review posts only) in the last 24 hours are most likely **lost** and not &#8220;rejected&#8221; or &#8220;moderated&#8221;.

Sorry for the inconvenience. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### 2. For our friends, partners, clients, etc

All our paid clients are safe. All the necessary changes for them has been taken care by us.

For rest, whose sites are hosted on our Dreamhost account, please replace hostname **rtcamp.com** with **orkutfeeds.com**.

Similarly host for mysql databases is now **mysql.orkutfeeds.com**.

You can try host names **orkutfeeds.com** for FTP and **mysql.orkutfeeds.com** for MySQL if you are not able to log into FTP account or cannot connect with the database.

If you are facing any other problem, please contact us.

That&#8217;s it for the time being. More about the migration process and other tech-tips, later. Do let us know if you face any problem with any of the sites in our network.

Thanks. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
