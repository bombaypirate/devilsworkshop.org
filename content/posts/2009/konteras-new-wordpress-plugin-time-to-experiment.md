This recent version have many enhancements which allow you to control areas on your blog where **ContentLinks** (in-text advertising links) get displayed.

Before how this can be used, have a look at list of few things you can do with this plugin&#8230;

  * Add the ContentLink tag to all your pages in one click
  * Determine when ContentLink ads will begin appearing on new posts- you can choose to block ads for a particular number of days
  * Display ContentLinks only on posts
  * Display ContentLinks only on comments
  * Change ContentLinks color
  * Choose to enable or disable ContentLink ads from within your post editor.

## Now its time to experiment&#8230;

### 1. Better user experience

Features like displaying ContentLinks only on posts & comments is specially good for some bloggers who find ContentLinks in areas like header, sidebar and footer more obstructive.

There was always debate on topic that in-text advertising degrades user experience. I accept this to some extent. I personally hate such links targeting keywords in header and footer of my blog.

So if usability is something keeping you away from Kontera till now, you can <a href="http://www.kontera.com/ads-for-site/become-a-kontera-publisher?type=1&aff_ID=5568" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kontera.com/ads-for-site/become-a-kontera-publisher?type=1&aff_ID=5568', 'join and try a new revenue stream for your blog']);" >join and try a new revenue stream for your blog</a>.

### 2. More revenue

Be it Adsense or Kontera. All such ad-networks at advertisers end run a bidding process.

By limiting ads to post-area only you are effectively reducing supply of keywords avaible for advertisers. As supply goes down, demand increases. This may convert into higher eCPM.

I am surely gonna experiment with this. I strongly feel this will increase Kontera revenue to some extents. Even if it doesn&#8217;t increase and remains same, this is better approach as it will better the user experience.

Also if you decide to opt-in for experiement, let it run for atleast a month or two before deciding on results. Some impatient publisher run experiments like this for a day or two and count on results which are incorrect, most likely.

Thanks Mika and Vered.
