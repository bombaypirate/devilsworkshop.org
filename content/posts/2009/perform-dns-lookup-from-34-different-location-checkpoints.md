In a previous post I had written about a [web service with which you can check if a website has any downtime][1] and sends you an email notification. It can be quite handy for webmasters getting notified about a website&#8217;s downtime.Â Here is another service which will be really helpful for webmasters to carry out a **DNS lookup **from over 34 locations worldwide.

### Why carry out a DNS Lookup?

  * Often you might get a scenario that a website is facing downtime from where you are working but that is not the case for everyone.
  * It could be a server problem with the service which is hosting the website or it can even be a issue with DNS server of your ISP.
  * Here before trying out [Google Public DNS][2] or [Open DNS][3] you might want to carryout a **DNS** **Lookup** for the website using <a href="http://just-dnslookup.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://just-dnslookup.com', 'Just DNS Lookup']);" >Just DNS Lookup</a>. Just to know if the DNS is being resolved successfully across the world.

### <a href="http://just-dnslookup.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://just-dnslookup.com/', 'Just DNS Lookup']);" >Just DNS Lookup</a>

  * The format is pretty simple. Just visit the website and enter the **URL** for which you want to conduct a DNS lookup.
  * Once done you will get data from various location **checkpoints** the website will conduct on the URL.
  * There is no need to sign-up of register with the website to use this service. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
