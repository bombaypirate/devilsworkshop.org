## What will you get with SUSE Studio?

  * You will be able to create appliances within the license agreement terms and to store them in your SUSE Studio Home.
  * Your Home will have a certain amount of disk space depending on the number of SUSE Studio users.
  * Inactive images will be deleted after a while, but this is no problem, it&#8217;s easy to restore them again with the appliance configuration file.
  * The appliances are based on one of the following base systems 
      * JeOS, openSUSE 11.1, SUSE Linux Enterprise
  * The templates offer different combinations of 
      * Server, Desktop, KDE, Gnome, Minimal X, 32 or 64 bit architecture
  * The openSUSE build service repositories are shared with SUSE Studio and you can upload private rpms to your private repository
  * You will be able to create 
      * **Live CDs/DVDs**, e.g. to demonstrate projects like Marble, Mono, etc. or **Installation medias** for special hardware, e.g. EeePC
      * **Disk Images** like **Live USB sticks**, e.g. running openSUSE 11.1 with KDE or Gnome without touching the hard disk of the machine
      * **Server-appliances** based on **Xen Image** or **VMware Image**, e.g. LAMP, Joomla, SUGARCRM, WordPress, etc.

The service is currently invite based. Just sign up from <a href="http://susestudio.com/account/login" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://susestudio.com/account/login', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>, and wait for your invitation. My guess is that you may get it quickly, since I got it within 24 hours!

A note: The many options may be overwhelming at the beginning. Getting used to it may take some time.
