[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4653" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/gazup.png" alt="gazup" width="200" height="71" />][1] Uploading files to multiple hosts is a difficult task as it requires to visit each and every web site and upload files again and again. It consumes a lot of time. If you are also among those users who upload their files to multiple hosts, here is a online tool for you to upload your files to multiple file hosts from one place.

Yesterday when I was stumbling, I found this online service <a href="http://www.gazup.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gazup.com/', 'Gazup!']);" >Gazup!</a> which allows you to upload your files to many famous file hostsing service in one go. When you upload your file to Gazup! their servers will automatically mirror your file to 9 file hosts which includes&#8230;

  1. RapidShare
  2. FileFactory
  3. MegaUpload
  4. MediaFire
  5. NetLoad
  6. zShare
  7. Badongo
  8. HideMyAss
  9. UploadBox

### Why use Gazup!

  * If you use Gazup! you will save time as their servers are capable of faster uploads than your average home ISP company.
  * Using Gazup! you will also save your bandwidth as you need to upload your file only once in order to get it uploaded to multiple hosts. If you have limited bandwidth per month the it will be beneficial for you.
  * If you upload a video, their server will automatically generate a screenshot for the video.
  * You will get alerts when a mirror goes down, if someone comments on your file or when a mirror has finished uploading.

It is totally free service and doesn&#8217;t require any registration. Registration is optional. If you register, you will get some more features like Private control room, Manage uploaded files, Win cash prizes for uploading.
