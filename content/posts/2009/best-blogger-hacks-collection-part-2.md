Well this my 2 post on the same topic nearly after 6 month in my last post I have coverred all major hacks related to blogger but there better version of hacks now so in this post you get to know about few updated hacks and few new hacks.

****Post Summaries WordPress Style**** ****

The very popular Read More or Expandable summaries hack almost every blogger uses this hack but this hack is quite irritating especially if your using the version in which you have to divide the post into two parts summary and the rest of it, also this version sometimes works and sometimes does not and its hard to implement on a old blogger since you have to divide each post to apply this hack uniformly.<figure style="width: 498px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

**Related Posts Hack**

As its name suggests it adds the list of  your previous posts under same tag under your post body this certainly useful as you keep the visitor enagaged in your site.

There are many version of this hack but am very impressed by a version Developed by <a href="http://www.beepthegeek.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.beepthegeek.com', 'Gagan ']);" target="_blank">Gagan </a>because it mixxes with nearly all blogs and has a neat presentation and looks amazingly professional.

Now look at the other hacks and hack developed by Gagan

**Breadcrumbs for navigation in Blogger**

<img class="size-full wp-image-12906" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/08/2.JPG" alt="Breadcrumbs" width="368" height="45" />

Breadcrumbs make s navigation easy and help the user to move from one Label to another flawlessly, but the term Breadcrumb is itself quite confusing  so here is definition of Breadcrumbs from Wikipeadia.

> Breadcrumbs or breadcrumb trail is a navigation aid used in user interfaces. It gives users a way to keep track of their location within programs or documents. The term comes from the trail of breadcrumbs left by Hansel and Gretel in the popular fairytale.

As far I remember i saw this hack first developed by <a href="http://www.bloggerbuster.com/2008/10/add-breadcrumb-trail-and-status.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloggerbuster.com/2008/10/add-breadcrumb-trail-and-status.html', 'Amanda']);" target="_blank">Amanda</a> which deals with usual code editing and related stuff but the best about this version is that it will appear in different styles on your different Blog pages.

<a href="http://www.bloggerbuster.com/2008/10/add-breadcrumb-trail-and-status.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloggerbuster.com/2008/10/add-breadcrumb-trail-and-status.html', 'Use this hack']);" target="_blank">Use this hack</a>

**Recent posts Widget with Thumbnails**

This widget was developed by Aneesh this looks very attractive and looks professional you can edit the no of words in summary and thubnails support is good but it show images upload via blogger only.

    <p>
      <strong>SEO</strong><strong> </strong> for me seems an endless topic everyone has its own way to describe it but most important thing we should we remember that<em> </em><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Content is the King</span></em></strong><em> </em>it does not matter that poorly your blog is optimize for search engines but if written good articles than visitor will sure came back to your Blog, also you need to change your Blogging habits for example post at a particular time, so that readers knew exactly when they will have fresh content.
