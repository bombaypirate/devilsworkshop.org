The deal is still subject to approval by On2 Technologies&#8217; stockholders and review by relevant regulatory authorities, including the SEC, but we expect it to close in Q4.  
> Although we&#8217;re not in a position to discuss specific product plans until after the deal closes, we are committed to innovation in video quality on the web, and we believe that On2 Technologies&#8217; team and technology will help us further that goal.”*

In the meantime, Google says that nothing will change for On2 Technologies&#8217; current and prospective customers.
