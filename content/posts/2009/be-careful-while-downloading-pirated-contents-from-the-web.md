  Recently, on one of my <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/watch-bollywood-movies-online-for-free/">post</a>, I mentioned on how to save a few bucks, Internet users just keep downloading pirated contents without even checking, the name of the sites they are downloading contents from. I have seen many internet users who dump GBs of contents ranging from Movies, Music, Apps etc from many bogus sites to their hard disks. Have you ever imagined what the consequences may be?

  According to <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pak-song-sites-may-be-used-to-hack-indian-web/407259/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pak-song-sites-may-be-used-to-hack-indian-web/407259/', 'sources']);" >sources</a>, many popular song sites including <a href="http://www.songs.pk" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.songs.pk', 'songs.pk']);" >songs.pk</a> are many times used to infect targeted PCs with harmful and malicious viruses that could badly harm your computer networks and systems.

  You will be shocked to know this statement flashed in <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pak-song-sites-may-be-used-to-hack-indian-web/407259/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pak-song-sites-may-be-used-to-hack-indian-web/407259/', 'The Indian Express']);" >The Indian Express</a>:

>   With these websites (songs.pk and others) being highly popular, it will take only a few minutes for the hackers to take command of over 12 lakh computers in few minutes and the number of such computers can multiply in every minute, sources said.

Recently I also posted on how more and more <a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/news/war-initiated-between-india-pak-in-cyber-space" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/news/war-initiated-between-india-pak-in-cyber-space', 'Orkut Communities are being targeted']);" >Orkut Communities are being targeted</a> by many unethical hackers.  
Hence, this post is not to panic you, rather it is for your information that, even your computer system can be targeted for some small mistakes that you commit.. So hence forth, **be careful while downloading pirated contents from the web.**
