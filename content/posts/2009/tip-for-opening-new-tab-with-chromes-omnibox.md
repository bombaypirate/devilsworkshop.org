I came across this tip on opening a new tab from **Chrome&#8217;s Omnibox **thanks to Peter Kasting from <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/11/tip-new-tab-from-omnibox.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/11/tip-new-tab-from-omnibox.html', 'Chrome Blog']);" >Chrome Blog</a>. It is quite useful when you are typing in a website address and want it opened in a new tab.

The **Omnibox** in Chrome browser is a mix of both the address bar and the search bar. This means when I enter some text into the Omnibox and press enter it shows up results of the text from Google search.

### Open new tabs with Omnibox

  * Lets say you open the Chrome browser and the homepage loads up. I want to search for information on **Gtalk**.
  * So I start typing &#8216;How to install Gtalk&#8217; in the **address bar** and press **Alt + Enter** which opens a new tab with search results for installing Gtalk.
  * This way using **Alt + Enter** while typing text on Omnibox, I can open multiple tabs which are relevant without needing to open a new one and then enter the text.

*Below is the demo on how browsing is easier and quicker by opening new tab with **Alt + Enter** with Omnibox. Every new tab is opened with by pressing **Alt + Enter****.*



I hope you found this tip as useful as I found it to be and this tip is not just **Chrome** specific it also works the same way with **Internet Explorer**, **Firefox. **Unfortunately it does not work with **Opera** browser.

Do let me know what you think of it through your comments.
