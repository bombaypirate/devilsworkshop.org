I just discovered this bug in Apple’s Safari 4 Beta. Although some “interesting effects” and minor issues are expected out of a beta release and should go away in the final version but after all, a bug is a BUG!

<p style="text-align: justify">
  In WordPress, when we use the Tiny MCE Editor &#8211; WYSIWYG and click on Upload Media or Insert/Remove hyperlink or anything which gives a lightbox type effect in a different window and changes the focus from the previous window. The screen gets stuck and kind of hangs! You cant go back, the X (Cross Button) doesn’t work, <strong>Esc</strong> key fails. It just hangs! You have to close the tab and reopen it all again.
