I have to say, this year is going to be the year of url shortners! With giants like google and facebook entering the url shortening business, now it&#8217;s the turn of youtube to join the caravan. Youtube has hit the internet with it&#8217;s new url shortner called [Youtu.be].<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-18206" title="u" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/u.jpg" alt="u" width="201" height="150" />

The only difference would be that the youtube url shortening service will exclusively be for the youtube videos. With the introduction of this new service, there will be more room for developers to show their imagination. The can now get custom urls for thumbnails, embedded videos and much more.

Now, to use this new url shortening service from youtube, take any youtube video url

&#8220;for example, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxx&#8221;

and **replace** the

&#8220;**http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=**&#8221; part with “**http://youtu.be/**”.

Your youtube urls will automatically be shortened and the new link will be redirected to the original video.

I wonder, if this will turn other video sites like **metacafe** etc. to launch their own url shortener! Only time will tell. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
