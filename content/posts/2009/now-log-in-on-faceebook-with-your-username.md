Yes the heading clears it all, you can now loging to your facebook account just by entering your username in place of your e-mail address. The best thing about this feature is that it is not only for facebook.com web browsers but also for m.facebook.com from your mobile and any website that suports facebook connect.

Let us clear you one thing that you can use your user name in place of your e-mail, it&#8217;s not your name. Top find your username you can go to,
