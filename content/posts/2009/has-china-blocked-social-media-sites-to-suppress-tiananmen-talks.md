Internet users in China have reported that not only Twitter, other services like Yahoo&#8217;s Flickr photo site, [YouTube][2], Microsoft&#8217;s HotMail, etc are also inaccessible.

### Has the Chinese government purposely blocked social media sites?

It is indeed being suspected by many. Tomorrow is China’s 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square. It is possible that some sites on the Internet have been blocked in order to suppress and shut off the Tiananmen talks – an extreme measure to shield its citizens from any hint of the anniversary of the military crackdown that ended the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement.

### What is the Tiananmen Square incident of 1989?

Around 4000 to 6000 civilians (unconfirmed) were shot dead by the Chinese army during a bloody military operation on 4<sup>th</sup> June 1989 to crush a democratic protest in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.

### Some recent bans!

[Government censorship of political material on Internet is common in China][3], but this is the first time Twitter has been blocked.

  * Censors blocked Chinese users from viewing all videos on YouTube
  * BBC World News reports related to the Tiananmen anniversary were being selectively blacked out of broadcast programs in China.
  * A number of sites that have hosted Chinese bloggers, including [Blogger blogs][3] and the Chinese-language version of WordPress, have also been blocked.
  * The distribution of the ‘South China Morning Post’ that has frequently featured articles on Tiananmen and other sensitive issues has also been curbed.
  * Last weekend’s edition of The International Herald Tribune had an inside page of the newspaper with an article on the Dalai Lama &#8211; the Tibetan religious leader, missing.

There is also the possibility that Twitter could simply be experiencing some technical problems. Let’s wait a little more to get some more clarity on this.
