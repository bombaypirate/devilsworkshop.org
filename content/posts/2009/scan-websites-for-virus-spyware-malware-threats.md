<a href="http://siteadvisor.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://siteadvisor.com', '']);" ><img class="size-full wp-image-5066 alignright" title="mcafee site advisor" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/mcafee-security.jpg" alt="http://siteadvisor.com" width="225" height="277" /></a>Sometime back [Deepak posted][1] about <a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.siteadvisor.com/', 'McAfee SiteAdvisor']);" >McAfee SiteAdvisor</a>. It scans a website for any kind of threat issues to users.

<a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.siteadvisor.com/', 'McAfee SiteAdvisor']);" >McAfee SiteAdvisor</a> scans your site to the deepest level. It scans all your email areas, download files, online affiliations and annoyances from your site. You can not only scan your website or blog, you can scan any website (even if you don&#8217;t own it) on this platform.

Now comes the interesting, rather shocking part!

McAfee confirms that top download sites like <a href="http://download.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://download.com', 'download.com']);" >download.com</a> and <a href="http://softpedia.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://softpedia.com', 'softpedia.com']);" >softpedia.com</a> are having threat issues with their softwares. McAfee reported that these sites are having adwares, trojans in their download files.

### Virus scan result of download.com

It clearly says that not all the files from this largest software downloading site are safe.

### Below is scan result of softpedia.com

[<img class="size-full wp-image-5063 alignnone" title="website virus threat scan" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/website-virus-threat-scan.png" alt="website virus threat scan" width="462" height="160" />][3]

Softpedia is also suffering from spyware, adware and trojan threats. To defend their website, one of their staffs confirmed that they can&#8217;t control software developers or firms who update their software versions by adding new installation files without any information to Softpedia staffs. Well one can understand this problem, but shouldn&#8217;t they use some script to track these software upgrades? They should think about this.

Now you can integrate <a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.siteadvisor.com/', 'McAfee Site Advisor']);" title="McAfee Site Advisor">McAfee Site Advisor</a> utility with your browsers also. This utility will warn you about sites with potential threat issues in real time. Start using Site Advisor to keep your website and computer clean.
