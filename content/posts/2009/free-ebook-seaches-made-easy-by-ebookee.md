In an <a title="How to make your Online PDF Search Easy?" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-make-your-online-pdf-search-easy/" target="_self">earlier post</a>, I had written about a PDF Search Engine, but that did not seem very efficient or helpful. I tried using it for some time, however, the results very never too accurate.

<a href="http://www.ebookee.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ebookee.com/', 'eBookee']);" title="ebookee"  target="_self">eBookee</a> is a lot more effective. It has an easy to use download library, that gives you tons of free eBooks and download links.

## Features of eBookee:

  1. The best part eBookee is that it is well organized and allows you to run a search under various different categories like arts, music, design, law, politics, economics, encyclopedias, novels, and so many more.
  2. You could even download magazines and newspapers for free. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.
  3. Apart from that, you could also share your eBooks with others here.
  4. You also have the option to request for an eBook, in case you can&#8217;t find something online.
  5. This site also has a section called ‘Latest Added eBooks&#8217; where you could check what&#8217;s new and keep abreast of the latest eBooks that are being added to the library.

You never know, something might just suit your fancy while skimming through the list.

Try it out and let us know if this is something that helped you in your online eBook searches. I found it to be very useful.
