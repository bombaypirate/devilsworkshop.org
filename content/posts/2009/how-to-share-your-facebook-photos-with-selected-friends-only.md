<a href="http://www.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com', 'Facebook']);" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, a well known social networking website which is not only famous for it&#8217;s applications and clean design but also for it&#8217;s out standing privacy features. Here I am writing about such a privacy feature which is a necessity for all those Facebook users who love to add random friends but don&#8217;t want to share every personal thing with them.

### How to share your pics with selected friends on Facebook?

  * First <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos', 'go to']);" target="_blank">go to</a> the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos', 'album privacy page']);" target="_blank">album privacy page</a>. You can also access this page by Settings>>Privacy Settings>>Profile>><a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos', 'Edit Photo Album Privacy Settings']);" target="_blank">Edit Photo Album Privacy Settings</a>.
  * Now on that page you can see all your Facebook albums including Wall Photos and Mobile Uploads.
  * Select the album which you want to set visible to selected friends only.
  * Now click on customize&#8230; under Who can see this?

  * Now in the pop-up select some friends and start typing your friends name who all can see that particular album.

Now your album will be visible to selected friends only. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰
