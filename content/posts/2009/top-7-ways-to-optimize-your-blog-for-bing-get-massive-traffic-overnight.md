But there are some little little tips we got about Bing. I have listed the TOP 7 &#8211; which have been approved by the whole web, in one voice.

**1. Keywords In Domain**<img class="alignright" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/seo.jpg" alt="seo.jpg" width="240" height="185" />

It&#8217;s heard that Bing is giving great importance to the keywords that are present in the domain name itself. So, bear this in mind while buying a new domain.

**2. Age of your Domain  
**

It&#8217;s approved that Bing is having more attraction towards old links. So try to buy an old domain, instead of registering a new one and being marked as a baby.

**3. Size of the Content  
**

Bing gives a great importance to pages with huge contents. A post with a 600 words could surely drive you a lot of traffic overnight.

**4. Backlinks  
**

Just as Google, Bing also use backlinks to measure your blog. Bing also gives a great importance to quality links. A good link could give you great authority than 100 bad links. Also bear in mind that bad links could effect your Bing rankings negatively.

**5.  Anchor Text  
**

It seems like that Bing is having an eye on your anchor text too. So, don&#8217;t forget to use your killer keywords as your anchor text.

**6. Page Title  
**

In this case also, Bing shows similarity to Google. They are giving great importance to the page titles and the keywords in it.

**7. Internal Links  
**

Rather than counting the number of words, Bing is using the internal links on your site to calculate your keyword density. So don&#8217;t forget to give a link when you highlight your keywords.

There are so many other tips too, but these are the most useful and working tips. All these are simple and with these simple changes, you will be getting huge traffic !!! Isn&#8217;t it Interesting ?

So, make these changes on your blog, today itself. Enjoy&#8230;&#8230;!!
