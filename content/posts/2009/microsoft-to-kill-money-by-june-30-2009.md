Microsoft says that the changing customer patterns and greater functionality of bank and brokerage Web sites drove the decision.

Apparently, some early Microsoft Money users have more than 15 years of financial data stored in the product. Microsoft is working on ways to help users transition to other desktop products if they choose.

Although Microsoft will stop selling the product at the end of June, it plans to support it through January 2011. According to Microsoft, an expired version of Money Plus could be used indefinitely on the computer and configuration currently in place, with the exception of some of the services and features. Microsoft does not guarantee the compatibility with future operating systems and hardware configurations.

Last year, Microsoft stopped selling Money at retail stores, offering it only by Internet download.
