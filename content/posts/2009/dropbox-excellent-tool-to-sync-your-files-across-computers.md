Yesterday I was chatting with Deepak Jain our Senior Editor at rtBlogs and he brought to my notice a excellent tool for syncing your files across different computers. It is quite a handy tool for people who might be working on different computers or have two computers at home and need certain files to be in sync. I find this software quite helpful as I work from different computers at different locations. ðŸ˜‰

  * You need to first register to **Dropbox** and install it on your computer from the <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.getdropbox.com/', 'website']);" >website</a>. The free version allows you to sync a folder upto 2 GB.
  * Once you install **Get Dropbox** on your computer, you can even choose where you want to put the folder on your computer you want to sync with other computers you use.
  * Once done, you update saved files on one computer and all the folders are updated and saved automatically.
  * If one of the computers is damaged and you cant receive the files, that is fine as you can still retirive the folder from the <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.getdropbox.com', 'Get Dropbox']);" >Get Dropbox</a> website. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The best part of this software seems that all the computers synced through **Dropbox** do not need the same Operation System. It works across **Mac, Windows and even Linux**. Also by visiting the website on a mobile device you could access the folder contents with a mobile.
