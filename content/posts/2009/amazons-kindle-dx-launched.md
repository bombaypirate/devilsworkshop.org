Today, Amazon launched the much awaited, new and improved Kindle DX. Kindle DX has been designed especially to make the experience of reading newspapers, magazines and documents easy. In an <a title="Amazon to launch bigger, better Kindles!" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/amazon-to-launch-bigger-better-kindles/" target="_self">earlier post on Devils Workshop</a>, I had written about Amazon Kindles and how the launch of bigger, better ones will create a buzz in the market. Finally, it&#8217;s here.

**Kindle DX – Some new features:**

  1. This time the Kindle is designed to be 250% bigger (9.7 inch screen) than the recently-announced Kindle 2 gadget .
  2. Now you don’t have to scroll, pan or zoom. Just read.
  3. It has a built-in PDF document reader.
