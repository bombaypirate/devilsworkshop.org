If you have a blog or a website, then you could use byTagg to increase your advertising incomes from their affiliate program. It authorizes you to invite people to follow your blog with ByTagg, and you get 50% of all advertising profits that are generated. Isn’t that cool? What’s even better is that when someone downloads byTagg from your blog or your website, you earn 100% of all advertising profits during the users’ first month. When the user installs byTagg from your blog or website, they will get alerts on every new post that you publish. Chances are they might come back to your site to read the content, as a result increasing your online audience.

## To get started

  * Go to <a href="http://www.bytagg.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bytagg.com/', 'http://www.bytagg.com']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.bytagg.com</a>
  * Hit download and run the .exe file
  * You are good to go

Currently byTagg is only available for Microsoft Windows XP, 2000, Vista. You will have to wait for a little longer for the MAC and Linux versions.
