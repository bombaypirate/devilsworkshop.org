If you want to post tweets on Twitter and schedule them at a future date, you might want to check out **<a href="http://taweet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://taweet.com/', 'Taweet']);" >Taweet</a>**. It is quite a handy website, which allowed me to schedule tweets in the future months from today, to be posted on my <a href="http://twitter.com/bombaypirate" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/bombaypirate', 'Twitter account']);" >Twitter account</a>.

  * The website has a format in the form of a simple question. The question is &#8216;**What are you doing in the future?&#8217;** You write in the message and select a date from the calendar also with a specified time.
  * You can select post now and post in real time instead of scheduling them.
  * To schedule a **Future Tweet**, I needed to do some tweaking to the settings as by default the buffer is set for 12 hours. The buffer is a time frame in which if you schedule a tweet, it gets cancelled or deleted from **Twitter** to avoid double posts for your followers. I could reduce the buffer to 3 hours which is the minimum.
  * Taweet also allowed me to manage multiple Twitter accounts.
  * It also has a Facebook like feature which allows others using **Taweet** to comment on your Future Tweet. (see image below).

This is a great website if you want to write tweets and time them in a micro managed way. Scheduling tweets isÂ not really helpful for a time frame of a few minutes or an hour, but it is practical if you areÂ schedulingÂ **tweets** 12 hours or more in the future. This is quite helpful if you think your followers usually look up **tweets** in the mornings and you work at night. You can schedule them for the morning in that case. ðŸ˜‰
