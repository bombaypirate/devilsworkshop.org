**Google Search** has inducted another feature which gives the user the option to translate the keyword which is being searched into another language.

If you just type in the query and hit search while on <a href="http://google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com', 'Google.com']);" >Google.com</a>, you will obviously get a list of results. Click on **Show Options. **Check withinÂ **More Options** which shows up on the right hand side of the screen, go right down to **Standard Results** and you will see an option to click on **Translated Search**.

  * When you click on **Translated Search** the **Results** box appears at the top above all the search results.
  * Here you have the option of **adding** another language into which you want to translate the query.
  * Within those results of the translated query there is an option to **Show orginal text** which shows the text in the language added.
  * It supports 42 language as of now, but the only Indian language supported was **Hindi**.
