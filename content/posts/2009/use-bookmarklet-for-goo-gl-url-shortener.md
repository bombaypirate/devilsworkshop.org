I recently wrote about a how to use[ Google&#8217;s URL shortener service Goo.gl without any toolbars or extensions][1]. To that post <a href="http://ggl-shortener.appspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ggl-shortener.appspot.com/', 'Matthew Flaschen']);" >Matthew Flaschen</a> commented about a couple of tools he has developed. They are a **Firefox Addon** and a bookmarklet to use **Goo.gl**. I quite liked them and hence here is the review.

### Firefox Addon for Goo.gl

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18047" title="Goo.gl addon for Firefox without using Google toolbar" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/goo_gl_addon_firefox.png" alt="Goo.gl addon for Firefox without using Google toolbar" width="438" height="244" />

  * <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/55308" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/55308', 'Click here to download the Firefox Addon']);" >Click here to download the Firefox Addon</a> for using Goo.gl URL shortener without using Google toolbar on Firefox.
  * Click on **View **>> **Toolbars** >> **Customize**. Here just drag and drop the Goo.gl addon to any toolbar on **Firefox** browser.
  * Next visit any page you want to share, click on the addon button and the short URL is copied. Simply paste it wherever you want to share it.
  * This also works with the latest upgrade of Firefox 3.6 ([*Read about the upgrade here*][2]).

Why I liked this Add-on a lot is that I can simply click on the addon button and the url is copied. Most other short url generators create the url and make you copy it manually. Here I just had to paste it.

### Firefox Bookmarklet

Another way to use Goo.gl url service is by using it through a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is something which behaves like a toolbar when you click on it ([*Read about how Google brought Sidewiki into Chrome using Bookmarklets*][3]).

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18050" title="Bookmarklet for Goo.gl" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/bookmarklet_goo_gl.png" alt="Bookmarklet for Goo.gl" width="433" height="261" />

  * <a href="http://www.marklets.com/Bookmarklets/goo.gl+bookmarklet.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.marklets.com/Bookmarklets/goo.gl+bookmarklet.aspx', 'Click here to get to the page']);" >Click here to get to the page</a> of the Bookmarlet for Goo.gl.
  * Just drag and drop the link to your bookmarks tab.
  * When you visit a page click on the bookmark and the short Goo.gl url is shown.

I felt using the Firefox add-on a lot more friendly to use than using then **bookmarklet**. Anyways this is very useful for people who want to use Goo.gl url shortener without using [Google toolbar on Firefox.][4]

Let me know what you think about it through your comments.
