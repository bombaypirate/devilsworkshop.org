With more features being gradually rolled out, Google Suggest is likely to make your search easier and faster than ever before. But, if you don’t see the new features yet, you will soon!

One thing that we will **not **see now is the *result count *for items in the suggest box. Apparently, the feedback Google received says that the numbers were not helpful in comparing the relevance of the queries.

## New Features

### 1. Suggestions on the results page:

Google has moved on from showing search suggestions only based on your original search input. Now, a search made from the results page will provide suggestions that relate to the current results page.

*For example: *If your previous search was “Devils Workshop”, your new query will have the first few suggestions still related to Devils Workshop. This will help refine search queries to quickly find what you want.

</p>

### 2. Personalized suggestions:

Personalized suggestions will help you remember queries which gave you the good results earlier, making your new search easier and faster. Just sign in with your Google account and have Web History enabled, and Google may show some of your relevant past searches as you type.

If you don’t like any of the personalized suggestions, just click on “Remove” and it will be taken off from your Web History.

</p>

### 3. Navigational suggestions:

If you are looking to navigate directly to a specific site, and if your initial keystrokes say so, Google will provide you with that list for you to click on.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/05/clip-image0089.jpg" border="0" alt="clip_image008" hspace="12" width="436" height="334" />
</p>

### 4. Sponsored links in suggestions:

This is similar to the navigational suggestions. Google can sometimes detect what you&#8217;re typing is an ad. An ad is displayed as “Sponsored Link” with a colored background.

<p style="text-align: left">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/05/clip-image0104.jpg" border="0" alt="clip_image010" hspace="12" width="468" height="375" /><br /> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/ShSYnPMJuVI/AAAAAAAAD1E/dL9lJdqpy18/s1600-h/sponsored-link-in-suggest.png" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/ShSYnPMJuVI/AAAAAAAAD1E/dL9lJdqpy18/s1600-h/sponsored-link-in-suggest.png', '']);" ><img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/05/clip-image011.gif" border="0" alt="clip_image011" width="32" height="32" /></a><br /> In the days to come, you will notice more changes in Google Suggest. The suggestions will now be all in bold so that the you can easily scan the list.
