Spielberg’s first game was called “Bloom Blox” and the copies sold were close to one million globally since it was released for Nintendo’s Wii last May.

Spielberg stepped into the video game business after he realized that no video game really catered for his 7 children. Not just that, Spielberg says that he enjoys playing almost every game that comes out and is also a big fan of Nintendo&#8217;s Wii console for its motion-sensor controls that involves physical interactivity.

> **According to Spielberg:**
> 
> *“It&#8217;s been very, very good for a parent like me who wants our kids not to be couch potatoes, but to get up and move their bodies around more.”*

### **Features of the game:**

  * The game has up to 4 players that face a range of challenges.
  * There are a whooping 400 new levels in settings such as outer space and water.
  * The players can create their own user-generated content and share this with others online.
  * There are new characters, new tools, blox types(like virus and conveyor blox ) and blox shapes.

Till now video games have not really translated to the big screen, although Hollywood continues to try with new films like “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” by Disney Pictures.

> **Spielberg adds:**
> 
> *“So far, there hasn&#8217;t been a major success in the videogame industry based on a motion picture, nor has there been a very successful motion picture based on a videogame. There&#8217;s not been convergence, thus far. There will be. When it happens it will be dynamite.”*
