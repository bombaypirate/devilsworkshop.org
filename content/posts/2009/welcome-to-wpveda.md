### Whats the big deal about this new blog on WordPress!

As part of our client projects and our addiction for open-source technology, we at rtCamp develop lots of wordpress themes, plugins and hacks everyday.

Through WpVeda we will share our free and GPL based work with community from which we took a lot. We already have more than 6 wordpress/mu/buddypress plugins and bunch of free wordpress themes lined up for release. So you can expect a lot of good and free stuff on WpVeda in coming weeks.

You can also get free help from wordpress professionals who will be writing for this blog.
