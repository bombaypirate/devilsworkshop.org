The popularity of twitter is increasing day by day because it&#8217;s simple, clean and secured. But there&#8217;s one more major reason behind it&#8217;s popularity, that is you can follow your favourite celebrities, politicians, singers or even your favourite bloggers that are famous worldwide with thousands of followers.But it&#8217;s hardly impossible to find out the original account of your favourite once. There are hundreds of fake accounts with the same name and pic as that of the respective original account.
