It is called <a href="http://prism.mozilla.com/started/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://prism.mozilla.com/started/', 'Prism']);" >Prism</a> and it can convert webpages into Windows Application by using Firefox Browser.

### How to use Prism?

The Prism Add-on can be installed on Firefox by visiting the <a href="http://prism.mozilla.com/started/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://prism.mozilla.com/started/', 'Mozilla Labs']);" >Mozilla Labs</a> page. You can either download it as a Firefox Add-on or a standalone application.

Once the installation of the add-on is complete visit the website you want to convert into an application with Firefox. Then click on &#8216;Tools&#8217; and select &#8216;Convert Website to Application&#8217; as shown in the image below.

The application can have shortcuts on the Desktop, Start Menu and Quick Launch Bar.

### Features of Firefox Prism

  * Prism is very handy if you want to check your mail or updates on a website but have too many tabs open in the browser. This way you can access your email directly from the system taskbar or dock.
  * It is possible for associating browser links with this application. Usually on clicking a &#8216;mailto:&#8217; link, the browser looks for Outlook Express or any other Email Client by default. This way you can choose to have a web based Gmail application running on the desktop to open every time you click on a &#8216;mailto:&#8217; link.
  * You can customize the application to give pop-up alerts. For instance when you get a new mail, you can set it to notify you with a pop-up alert.
  * You can also set the application to run every time you start your computer.
  * Finally the best feature which I like is that you can just minimize the application back into the tray. A single click and you are back on the website. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
