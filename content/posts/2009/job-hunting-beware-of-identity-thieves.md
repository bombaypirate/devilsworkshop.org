Be careful not to fall into wrong hands. The growing number of people in search of a job in today’s time is leading to a massive rise in the number of fraud cases, reports <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2009/tc2009076_840879.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2009/tc2009076_840879.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech', 'Business Week']);" >Business Week</a>. Impostors these days are hacking into corporate job sites and sending out emails as employers to people. This way they end up collecting personal and sensitive data like a person’s banking details, social security number, etc., and misuse it to their advantage.

According to a report by APACS, the number of fake job ads rose more than four times over the last three years in the U.K.

## Highlights

  * In 2008, there were roughly 313,000 cases of consumers registering complaints of identity theft to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
  * As per the report by the commission, in February 2009, approximately 15% people said thieves had pulled out employment-related fraud with their stolen identities.
  * This is an increase from 14% of 259,266 identity-theft complaints in 2007.

**According to the 2009 Identity Fraud Survey Report:**

  * Identity theft on the whole has been on the rise, reaching up to 9.9 million in 2008.
  * Economic downturn contributes to this jump, since higher rates of fraud have historically occurred when the economy worsens.

## Better safe than sorry

Experts recommend:

  * People hunting for jobs should stay alert than ever.
  * They should be careful before letting out any personal information, especially Social Security numbers or bank details.
  * If a recruiter contacts you especially if you have not applied for that position, and asks for sensitive information, verify the background of the person independently.
  * It is best to send your resume directly to corporate sites.
