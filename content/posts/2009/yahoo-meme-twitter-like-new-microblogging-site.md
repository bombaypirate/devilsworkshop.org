Since &#8220;Microblogging&#8221; websites like<a href="http://www.twitter.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twitter.com/', ' Twitter.com']);" > Twitter.com</a> are gaining popularity day by day, Now Yahoo is also preparing to launch it&#8217;s a new &#8220;Microblogging&#8221; site by the name &#8220;Yahoo Meme&#8221;. Just like Twitter, Yahoo Meme is a site where you can share your messages, updates and pics (using twitpic in Twitter). But unlike twitter, it is also possible to share youtube videos and music which obviously turns out to be a advantage over similar options on net.You can also post comments below your shared content similar to Facebook.

Yahoo Meme is currently in it&#8217;s beta stage and is available for few users only (invitation basis). You may enter your E-Mail id <a href="http://meme.yahoo.com/home/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://meme.yahoo.com/home/', 'here']);" >here</a> and Yahoo will send you an invitation for the beta version of Yahoo Meme. Yahoo Meme is basically a Micro-blogging website in Portuguese language which soon will be available for worldwide users in English.

Yahoo Meme and Twitter:

  * You can share your text, images, videos, music e.t.c in Meme while you just have an option of text sharing in Twitter.
  * No RT (ReTeweet) in Meme, rather you have &#8220;Repost&#8221; plus there&#8217;s an integrated widget to count your Reposts.
  * Video sharing option in Meme is from youtube only.And you have to use links for sharing mp3&#8217;s, you can&#8217;t upload them.
  * Meme doesn&#8217;t have an API, so no desktop or any other tool for now at least.
  * &#8220;Followers&#8221; same for both Meme and Tweeter.
  * No @Replies and DM (Direct Messages) in Meme like Twitter
  * 100 words description and a choice of avatar selection after creating a profile(in Meme).
  * Meme Doesn&#8217;t have a 140 characters word limit.
