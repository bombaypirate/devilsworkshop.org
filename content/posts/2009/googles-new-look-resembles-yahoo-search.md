I came across an <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2009-11-25-n78.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2009-11-25-n78.html', 'article']);" >article</a> on the internet about Google experimenting with a redesign of their main homepage. Earlier they experimented a bit with a [minimalistic][1] looking search bar with no links appearing until the mouse was moved. The new design looks a lot more colorful and the icons are quiteÂ attractive.

### How to get Google search homepage with new look?

  * First you need to log out of Google and then visit <a href="http://google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com', 'Google.com']);" >Google.com</a>.
  * Then type the code which is below,Â  in your address bar for creating a cookie to let your browser know you are trying to look up the redesigned <a href="http://www.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com', 'Google homepage']);" >Google homepage</a>.

`javascript:void(document.cookie="PREF=ID=20b6e4c2f44943bb:U=4bf292d46faad806:TM=1249677602:LM=1257919388:S=odm0Ys-53ZueXfZG;path=/; domain=.google.com");`

  * After the code is entered, refresh the Google homepage. If you are in India and it loads the <a href="http://google.co.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.co.in', 'Google India']);" >Google India</a> page, just click on the link which reads as **Go to Google.com**. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### Google imitating Yahoo search?

I am a fan of **Google** and love it for it&#8217;s simplicity. The layout and the design over the years has retained its simplicityÂ  and all the search options are still out of sight neatly tucked under **More Options** link over the list of search results. I think that could exactly be the reason why **Google **is re-designing. It wants to make sure that people who are not adept at using their search engine, do get to know the various options available.

What I found strange about the new look was it&#8217;s similarity to <a href="http://search.yahoo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://search.yahoo.com', 'Yahoo Search']);" >Yahoo Search</a>. Below is a screen-shot taken from **Yahoo Search** and the similarities in the layout are quite striking. The usage of icons is extremely similar.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17318" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="google_redesign2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/google_redesign2.png" alt="google_redesign2" width="550" height="360" />

On a lighter note in view of Yahoo has slipping over the years, I hope this does not mean that Google will try emulating Yahoo. ðŸ˜‰

Do you like this new design Google is working on? Do let me know with your comments.
