I am sure you must have used <a href="http://translate.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://translate.google.com/', 'Google Translate']);" >Google Translate</a> at some point or the other. It works pretty fine, but sometimes you do wish for better, more intelligent results, rather than just exact word-to-word translations. We will all admit that machine or algorithm based translators have their own limitations.

So what is the way out? Is it possible to add a little bit of human touch to machine translators?

What do you think of a hybrid of Wikipedia and Google Translate? Well, if you still do not get the clue, then check the recently released <a href="http://translate.google.com/toolkit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://translate.google.com/toolkit', 'Google Translator Toolkit']);" >Google Translator Toolkit</a>. It is a** free online translation app** that helps translate content into other languages faster and more accurately.

### How does it work?

  * Choose a language to translate your document into
  * Upload a document, webpage or a Wikipedia article
  * Google translator automatically uploads, converts and translates the content
  * You can now review and improve the translation
  * You can view translations that were earlier translated by other users
  * You can share your translation with your friends and invite them to view or help edit your translation
  * When finished, you can download the translation to your desktop
  * For Wikipedia articles, you can even publish it back to the source

Localization and internationalization are two key components of making information accessible worldwide and translation tools do play an important role in that. Google translator toolkit promises to boost the making of information universally accessible to everyone around the world.
