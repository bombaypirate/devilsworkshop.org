  We have already discussed about Microsoft&#8217;s free antivirus software &#8216;<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/microsoft%E2%80%99s-free-antivirus-%E2%80%9Cmorro%E2%80%9D-coming-soon/">Morro&#8217; in an earlier post on DW</a>. The new free antivirus software from Microsoft, codenamed as &#8220;Morro&#8221; is actually called <strong>&#8216;Microsoft Security Essentials&#8217; </strong>which Microsoft released yesterday and is now available for download as Beta.

  Microsoft Security Essentials is designed to occupy less space and supports Windows XP, Windows Vista, and the forthcoming Windows 7 operating system. The new Microsoft free antivirus gives full protection from Viruses, Spyware, Rootkits, and Trojans, similar to other paid enterprises antivirus software. It is a big blow for those antivirus companies whose earn their yearly income of billions of dollars from their paid security software.

  J.R. Smith, CEO of AVG, said:
</p>

> Microsoft&#8217;s new offering will be good for consumers and good for the security market overall because it will raise awareness that security products are necessary. He expects that companies like AVG, Kaspersky, and Symantec will be able to provide more extensive protection than Microsoft is offering.
