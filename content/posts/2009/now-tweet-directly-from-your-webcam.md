Simple!

The service is now available on the two rival sites:**TwitVid.com** and **TwitVid.io**

Both of them have been racing to bring the service first on their platform, which allowed *tweeting* of only recorder videos so far. Reports indicate that TwitVid.com finally managed to win the race.

TwitVid.com and TwitVid.io have added the functionality of providing APIs that let other sites integrate into their services, thus helping them with distribution. TwitVid.com is also going to start support for the real-time streaming very soon.

The fight between the two rivals is beginning to get pretty serious. More than just names, the services too are confusingly similar.

And as always, the “real” winners in any such competition are the end users. So, let’s sit back and enjoy the charm of the upcoming new features on these sites, while they can continue to compete amongst themselves!
