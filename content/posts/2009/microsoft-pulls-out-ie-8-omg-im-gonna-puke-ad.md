Looking for a little more attention, Microsoft brought out a rather intriguing TV commercial earlier this week. The ad showed a wife asking to borrow the laptop from her husband (TV&#8217;s ex-Superman Dean Cain) and ends up throwing up over him after discovering porn hidden in his browser history.

The main idea behind this ad was to show and promote IE 8&#8217;s private browsing feature. Internet Explorer 8 has included a way to surf anonymously, allowing the user to suspend browsing history, cookies, and other identifying information. This commercial was one amongst four in Microsoft&#8217;s Better Browser campaign.

## Err… Offensive?

The ad, however, has been pulled out from Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.browserforthebetter.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.browserforthebetter.com/', 'Better Browser website']);" >Better Browser website</a> and its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ie8videos" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/user/ie8videos', 'IE 8 channel on YouTube']);" >IE 8 channel on YouTube</a>.

Microsoft said that although mostly the feedback on this creative commercial was positive, but some people found it offensive and queasy, hence Microsoft removed it.

> **According to a Microsoft representative:**
> 
> *&#8220;We make a point of listening to our customers. We created the OMGIGP video as a tongue-in-cheek look at the InPrivate Browsing feature of Internet Explorer 8, using the same irreverent humor that our customers told us they liked about other components of the Internet Explorer 8 marketing campaign. While much of the feedback to this particular piece of creative was positive, some of our customers found it offensive, so we have removed it.&#8221;*

The ad seems to have done well online, and many have appreciated it for the “sense of humor” behind it.

## Creating a Buzz

Sometimes filthy gross humor does really have an influence. And even though the ad has now been removed, it has succeeded in doing exactly what it was meant to do… creating a buzz.

## Watch the Video

Here is the video copy of the vomit ad, still available on YouTube, although not through Microsoft. Take a look <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
