You could also send emails from any of your other address, from your Gmail itself. This will save your time and effort, as a result make your life on the Internet a lot easy.

> **According to the Gmail blog:**
> 
> *“Whether you have an alumni address, a work account, or your own domain that you like to use, rather than logging in and out of multiple accounts, you can set yourself up so all your mail ends up in your Gmail inbox.”*

This feature has been around for quite some time now, but not many make use of it.

## Gmail tips on how to make this happen:

  * Use the free auto-forwarding or fetching option! 
      * Go to your non-Gmail account.
      * Change settings and set your Gmail address as the forwarding target.
      * In case your non-Gmail account does not give you the option of forwarding, check if it supports POP3 access.
      * If yes, then use Mail Fetcher in Gmail to automatically check your non-Gmail account for new emails and download it to Gmail.

      * Gmail&#8217;s custom &#8220;From:&#8221; feature will help you could send an email with one of your non-Gmail addresses listed as the sender in place of your Gmail address.
      * Just add the address you wish to use.
      * Verify that the email address belongs to you.
      * Using the address drop down, pick which address you want to reply from while composing an email.
