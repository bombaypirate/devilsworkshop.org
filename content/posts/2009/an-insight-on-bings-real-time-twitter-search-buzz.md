<img class="alignleft wp-image-51141" src="http://www.neowin.net/images/news/newlogos/bing-logo.png" alt="" width="250" height="96" />If you’re a bit of a geek, and use the Firefox browser, you can already add Twitter search results to both <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/add_twitter_search_to_bing.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/add_twitter_search_to_bing.php', 'Bing']);" target="_self">Bing</a> and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/make_google_real_time_with_twitter_ad-on.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/make_google_real_time_with_twitter_ad-on.php', 'Google']);" target="_self">Google</a> via Greasemonkey. But it’s pretty rudimentary, just a list of the five most recent Twitter search results for that particular query pasted atop the regular results. Now, in a nod to the (so called) increasing importance of real-time search, Microsoft has started adding Twitter updates to its Bing search engine. For now, the Twitter-related results are limited only to searches on prominent Twitterers themselves. You can read more on this on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/bing-adds-buzz-with-real-time-twitter-search-results/" target="_self">Swati&#8217;s post on the same</a>.

But wait a minute,  isn&#8217;t Google already offering much more realtime search results?

For instance, try searching <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=cicso" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=cicso', 'CISCO on Google']);" target="_self">CISCO on Google</a> and the engine will give a live stock quote too. Try searching <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=usd+to+inr" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=usd+to+inr', 'USD to INR']);" target="_self">USD to INR</a> for the latest conversion rate. Apart from this, <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogsearch.google.com', 'Google&#8217;s Blog Search']);" target="_self">Google&#8217;s Blog Search</a> crawls blogs almost every 15 mins. Bing has just done to microblogging what Google did to Blogging two years ago <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Nonetheless, am sure Google will soon implement this and may be throughout all twitter accounts.

I may have been a bit too heavy on Bing and that&#8217;s because I am completely sold out Google&#8217;s &#8216;Do No Evil&#8217; stand. Let me know what&#8217;s your take on this.
