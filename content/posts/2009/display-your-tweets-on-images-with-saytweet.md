<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/analyze-your-twitter-followers-using-twittersheep/" target="_self">Twitter</a> is a free social networking tool and if effectively used can really bring traffic to your blog/site. But today&#8217;s post is not about any traffic. In this post I am going to tell you that how you can display your tweets on images and then put it on your blog, no HTML or CSS skills required. You just have to select an image, upload it on web and you are done.

**Lets start&#8230;  
**

  1. First select any image on which you want to display your tweets.
  2. Now visit **<a href="http://saytweet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://saytweet.com/', 'SayTweet']);" target="_blank">SayTweet</a>** and upload your selected image.
  3. Now put a tick on *I own or have permission to use this picture* and click on **Upload**. Here is my image on which I want to show my tweets.<img class="size-medium wp-image-5310 alignnone" title="twitter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/twitter-300x137.jpg" alt="twitter" width="300" height="137" />
  4. Now select the region where you want the tweets to appear. **Have a look&#8230;**<img class="size-medium wp-image-5311 alignnone" title="username-saytweet" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/username-saytweet-300x121.png" alt="username-saytweet" width="300" height="121" />
  5. After selecting the region enter your Twitter user name, enter tags, fill the captcha and then click on **Save and finish**. This is how the final image will look like&#8230;.[<img class="size-medium wp-image-5309 alignnone" title="say-tweets" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/say-tweets-300x143.png" alt="say-tweets" width="300" height="143" />][1]
