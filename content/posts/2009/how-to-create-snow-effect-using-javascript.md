So guys, the winter season is almost here and let&#8217;s do something special for this season. As a blogger the best thing we can do is to add the snow effect in our blog or website by using simple javascript. This snow effect is used to create a special effect for your blog/website which looks like snow(not actually ðŸ˜› , just some white dots)Â  is falling from top to bottom on your web page.

**FEATURES:**

  * Light weight, doesn&#8217;t makes a page heavy.
  * Easy to implement.
  * Easy to remove.
  * Looks good and temporarily changes the looks of your blog/website.

**EXAMPLE BLOG:**

Check out <a href="http://testblogdw.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://testblogdw.blogspot.com/', 'this blog']);" target="_self">this blog</a> where we have implemented the &#8220;Snow Effect&#8221; code.

**CODE:**

Copy the code given below**,**

<script src=&#8221;http://snow-effect.googlecode.com/files/snow.js&#8221; type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;>  
</script>

**IMPLEMENTATION(for blogger blogs):**

To use the above code in your blogger blog, go to:

**Dashboard>>Layout>>Add a Gadget>>HTML/Javascript**

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14682" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/html_logo1.jpg" alt="html_logo" width="441" height="108" />

Paste the JavaScript there and you are all done, just go to your homepage and see the changes ðŸ˜‰

**JavaScript Source: **<a href="http://code.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://code.google.com/', 'google code']);" target="_self">google code</a>.
