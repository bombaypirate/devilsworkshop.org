<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness', 'Color blindness']);" >Color blindness</a> is a condition which is prevalent among almost upto 10% of the population. This can mean that if you have a website, its color scheme can perceived differently by 10% of the visitors. Most common condition is when a person mixes up colors which are shades of green and blue.

The question that needs answering is does it affect someone viewing your website? Would a mix of certain colors confuse or make the website difficult to navigate? I came across <a href="http://www.vischeck.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vischeck.com/', 'Vischeck']);" >Vischeck</a> a website which simulate different ways color scheme of your website could be perceived.

  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">I just needed to go to their website, enter the URL of the website and get an simulation of how someone with color blindness would perceive the website.</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">There are multiple options to select for simulating color visual of a website. It has limitations as it does not simulate colors properly if website has Flash or certain type of Java Script operations.</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">I did the simulation with our very own <strong>Devils Workshop</strong> and tried to see if it could have any issues in color perception.</span>

If you look at the comparison, the teal coloured text which we have on **Devils Workshop** can be perceived as purple. This is not much of an issue for DW, as the background is white and we have written material which is predominant rather than images.

A lot of our readers also have their own blogs and I think if you have websites with a lot of color you might want to take a look at <a href="http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckURL.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckURL.php', 'Vischeck']);" >Vischeck</a> to see if someone visiting your site is not being inconvenienced with the color scheme inadvertently.

Do look up some websites with <a href="http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckURL.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckURL.php', 'Vischeck']);" >Vischeck</a> and let me know through your comments if you have got some interesting results.
