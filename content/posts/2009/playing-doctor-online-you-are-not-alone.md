According to <a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.harrisinteractive.com/', 'The Harris Poll']);" >The Harris Poll</a> survey, most *cyberchondriacs* (people looking for health information online) value and trust the health care information they read over the Internet, and this in turn leads to discussions with their doctors.

Some 11 years ago, one-quarter of all adults, i.e., 54 million people had gone online to look for health information. Today, the numbers have increased rapidly to some 67% of adults, i.e., 154 million people who had done this. Reports indicate that a large number of users find online health information reliable and many discuss it with their doctors.

## Highlights from the report

  * 83% of cyberchondriacs said that their search for information online was successful and almost half (45%) say it was “very successful”.
  * 87% believe that this information was reliable, and 28% say it was “very reliable”.
  * 44% of cyberchondriacs have discussed information they obtained online with their doctors.
  * 49% of cyberchondriacs have searched for information online based on discussions they had with their doctors.
