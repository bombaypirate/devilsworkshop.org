**Blogger$ of the Month** contest is now adopting a new face for the month of **December,2009**.

Previously we had the format in which weÂ  have selected the top 3 bloggers for their posts from all the blogs across <a href="http://rtblogs.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com', 'rtBlogs Network']);" >rtBlogs Network</a>.Â  The total prize money was **$150**, which was distributed as **$75**, **$50** and **$25** to the these bloggers as per the ranks in the ratings table.

### Whats New ??

For this month onwards we will have individual rating tables for 3 of our blogs namely,

  * [Devils Workshop][1]
  * <a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/', 'Facebooknol']);" >Facebooknol</a>
  * <a href="http://www.crictalks.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crictalks.com', 'CricTalks']);" >CricTalks</a>

A cash prize of **$50** would be awarded to the highest ranked **bloggers** in each of theseÂ  rating table&#8217;s. The ratings format will be the same as it was in the preceding months and the posts will be rated by our editors.

You can use the same user id and password to login into <a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/wp-login.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/wp-login.php', 'Facebooknol']);" >Facebooknol</a> and <a href="http://www.crictalks.com/wp-login.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crictalks.com/wp-login.php', 'crictalks']);" >crictalks</a>.

### Why the change?

The basic idea yet again is to promote the new Bloggers on our platform. But this time, we are also looking for bloggers who are passionate to share information on topics like Facebook and our beloved cricket ðŸ˜€
