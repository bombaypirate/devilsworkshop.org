Recent Facebook launched a very nice feature of &#8220;<span>Tag Friends in Your Status and Posts&#8221; on which you read an article by our Editor-  Aditya Kane on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/tag-friends-on-facebook-with-twitter-like-symbol/" target="_self">Devils Workshop</a>. This post is just to clarify it further. The official blog of Facebook clearly says that &#8220;</span><span>Tag Friends in Your Status and Posts&#8221;, but the reality is that you can tag anything in your status and posts like friend&#8217;s <strong>profile</strong>, <strong>groups</strong> that you have joined and even <strong>pages</strong> of which you are a fan.</span>

To tag a friend, page or group, just use @ symbol before you start typing the name that you want to tag. To know more about it read <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/tag-friends-on-facebook-with-twitter-like-symbol/" target="_self">this post</a> on <a href="http://www.devilsworkshop.org" target="_self">Devils Workshop</a>.

Facebook tagging is a nice and important feature cuz it gives the information about the exact person, page or group about which we are talking or writing something about it. So next time don&#8217;t forget to tag the person or anything in your status. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
