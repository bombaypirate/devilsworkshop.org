<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.computerworld.com/', 'Computerworld’s']);" >Computerworld’s</a> career section has started an <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9126955" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9126955', 'IT layoff tracker']);" >IT layoff tracker</a>. It is updated with worldwide layoff announcements published on Computerworld itself. It is keeping track of which companies have been cutting jobs since the September 2008.

Computerworld is a big portal and they do not publish news about layoff’s in small companies, so actual number of layoff’s in IT companies must be more than what this tracker shows.

This layoff tracker is basically a database which you can search by keywords, sort by companies, date, number of layoffs, etc.

Just had a closer look at this tracker and shocked to see some layoff figures like <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9127058" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9127058', 'NEC, a Japanese electronic company is laying off 20,000 jobs']);" >NEC, a Japanese electronic company is laying off 20,000 jobs</a> and <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9114741" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9114741', 'HP’s 24,600 layoffs']);" >HP’s 24,600 layoffs</a>. <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9126000" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9126000', 'Google seems in better position with only 100 layoffs']);" >Google seems in better position with only 100 layoffs</a>.

I am no expert to comment on the economical crisis. I can only advise to bookmark this tracker and keep seeing it, whenever you feel lazy at work.

Thank god, [I took blogging as a profession][1]. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
