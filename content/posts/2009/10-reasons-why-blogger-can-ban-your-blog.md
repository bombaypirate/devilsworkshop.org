Prevention is better than cure, so its better to avoid some mistakes while creating a new blog. Here are some instruction for you, that you must follow in order to not to get ban from Blogger

  1. **Pirated Stuff :** Do not ever create a blog on pirated stuff like illegal software, cracks. Even giving links to download movies and games may lead to permanent ban.
  2. **Porn Content :** You Blog should not contain any type of porn content like images, videos etc
  3. **Virus : **Always download templates/themes for your blog from trusted websites. If your blog tries to install a virus, malware, spyware into visitors system, you will loose your blog forever.
  4. **Spamming :** Do not spam. By spamming I mean to say do not write same comments on different blogs. Do not spam on Social networking websites like Orkut, Facebook etc.
  5. **Crude Content :** Do not post graphics that can upset your readers i.e images of accident, behead videos etc.
  6. **Threatening :** If you threaten others through your blog, it may lead to immediate blog.
  7. **Copying Content : **Copying content from other sites will lead to permanent ban. So be careful. If you want, you can write a summary of the post in different words and then give the link to the original source.
  8. **Linking to Porn :** Even putting a link to any porn site will make your blog ban no matter if that link is no-follow or do-follow.
  9. **Linking to Warez :** Linking to warez or those website that promotes pirated stuff will get your blog deleted by Blogger Team
 10. **Hate Content : **You may get your blog ban by writing hatred or violent content also.
