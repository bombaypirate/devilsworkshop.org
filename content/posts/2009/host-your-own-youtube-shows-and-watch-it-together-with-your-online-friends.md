This way you can host your own shows and watch them with your friend(s) sitting together in a virtual room.

The service is currently available in private beta version and pre-registration for the site is open. Luckily, I got a private invitation to try out its features. Here is what I found at the siteâ€¦

## Features

  * You can search for content to share on YouTube, Photobucket and Yahoo Images
  * You can invite as many as four other friends to chat in the video conferences at the same time
  * You can do web phone calls or conduct webinars that others can subscribe to
  * You can share slide shows and discuss them live
  * You can build your own social network group around your content

## How it works?

  * Search for your favorite YouTube video, Yahoo Images or Photobucket images. You can even upload images from your computer.
  * Add them to your show
  * Mark your show as private or public
  * Open your show to go live
  * Invite friends to watch your show
  * See your friends watching the show, through their webcams
  * Chat with them using text messaging
  * All this is possible in a single collaboration window

The service simulates a synchronized environment, bringing the web meetings concept from board rooms straight into your living rooms.

The public beta version of the service is built on a patent pending technology and is reported to go live on June 1. Initially the service will be absolutely **free** to use.
