As a unique promotional offer for all new customers, MTNL is also offering a “Jodi” 2G prepaid SIM with a free video calling facility.

> **R. S. P. Sinha, Chairman and Managing Director, MTNL said:**
> 
> *“Since prepaid is the most preferred mode by the customers, this service will meet their requirements, whereby they can avail facilities like making local video calls at Rs. 1.8/minute, download data at Rs. 3 MB and free video calling by choosing data coupons.”*

Now people can plan their phone usage according to their budget, as well as keep track of the expenditure incurred. As of now, approximately 90 % Delhi, Mumbai, Gurgaon and parts of Faridabad have been enlisted under the network coverage area of this service. MTNL has managed to rope in 400 subscribers for 3G services with an ultimate aim to have 200,000-300,000 subscribers within the first year of operations.

If anyone tried MTNL 3G, then do share your comments about its connectivity, speed, service, and other related details.
