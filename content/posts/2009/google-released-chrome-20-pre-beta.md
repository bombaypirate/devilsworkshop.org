  Recently Googleâ€™s final version of Chrome 1.0 was <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/beta-out-google-chrome-10-in/">released</a> and now, Google is planning to come out with some other new and improved features and hence it has just <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/01/google-chrome-20-pre-beta.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/01/google-chrome-20-pre-beta.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a> the release of a pre-beta version &#8211; Chrome 2.0. In this pre-beta release&#160; of Google Chrome, there are many new features that its users were looking for, like &#8211; Forms auto fill option, full-page zoom, auto scroll, <strong>support for GreaseMonkey scripts</strong>, etc.

  Among all the additional features in Chrome 2.0 Pre-Beta release, the feature I personally liked is support for GreaseMonkey scripts (User Scripts) though I am yet to try them out. If you want to try these new features, just follow the instructions given on the official <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/01/google-chrome-20-pre-beta.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/01/google-chrome-20-pre-beta.html', 'Google blog']);" >Google blog</a>. But do not forget that, as this is a pre-beta release, all new features are just experimental and may harm your computer system.
