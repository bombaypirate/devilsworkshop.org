## Blogger of The July 2009

July 2009, had very close competition between [Richi][1] and [Prateek][2]. As you can see from results table Richie won the race despite publishing 1 less post than Prateek.

Both Richie and Prateek published together 17 awesome posts which helped many users in our community. Overall, 40 posts were published in July by 17 guest blogger. <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tRKFo20GpGBF1PJuWvuGohA&output=html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tRKFo20GpGBF1PJuWvuGohA&output=html', 'Complete details are here']);" >Complete details are here</a>.

We congratulate Richie and wish all bloggers good luck!

## Major Changes&#8230;

Swati is no longer editor at rtBlogs. We already finalized new editor who will take charge in last week of August. We are also screening few more candidates as having multiple editors across entire rtBlogs network will be good idea.

If you are from Pune, or know someone who is interested in full-time blogging career, please <a href="http://rtcamp.com/careers/view-09-ft-be-01/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/careers/view-09-ft-be-01/', 'check this bloggin-job opening']);" >check this bloggin-job opening</a>.

We also regret for inconvenience some of our guest bloggers are going through.

You see, its all messed up for next few days. But we are damn sure that you guys will stay with us and keep us motivated for next-few-tough days! Thanks for that in advance! ðŸ˜‰

## Recognizing Good Blogging&#8230;

We silently increased privilege level of few guest bloggers from *contributor* to *author*. This means there posts will be published without any review from editor!

Here is the list of bloggers who are privileged author now. The list will expand soon! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  * [Himanshu Kalra][7]
  * [Vaibhav Kanwal][8]

### A note to privileged authors&#8230;

Triple-check your posts before you hit publish button. With power comes responsibility!

Editors will continue to rank your posts so that you get fair chance to win **Blogger of The Month **award.

## To all guest bloggers about pending posts&#8230;

There are more than 50 posts in draft which we regard as incomplete. You have to log into [DW Dashboard][12] and submit your posts for review if you think they are complete.

Many authors use **Draft feature **to develop long articles and tutorials over the time so we editors never touch that area.

If you are waiting for your post to be published, you have to submit it for review. As long as it stays in draft, it will be ignored!

If you have any other question, feel free to use comments or [use forum][13]!
