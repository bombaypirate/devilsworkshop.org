Recently Facebook changed all it&#8217;s privacy settings and by default your personal information like wallposts, photos, profile pics, info e.t.c became visible to everyone who&#8217;s on Facebook. But this new privacy feature isn&#8217;t irreversible, you can easily get back your private and protected profile back, just follow the steps given below.

**Step 1: **From your <a href="http://www.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com', 'Facebook&#8217;s homepage']);" target="_self">Facebook&#8217;s homepage</a>, go to **Settings>> Privacy Settings **or simply <a href="http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy&ref=mb" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy&ref=mb', 'click here']);" target="_self">click here</a>.

**Step 2: **Now go to &#8216;Profile Information&#8217; in Privacy Settings page and select &#8216;Only Friends&#8217; option given on right in each row with the info like about me, personal info.

**Step 3: **For &#8216;Photo Albums&#8217; click &#8216;Edit Settings button given with it and select &#8216;Only Friends&#8217; again for each of the album listed there. Click save settings for albums.

**Step 4: **Now again go toÂ  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy&ref=mb" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy&ref=mb', 'Settings>> Privacy Settings']);" target="_self">Settings>> Privacy Settings</a>, click on &#8216;Contact Information&#8217; this time.

**Step 5: **Again select &#8216;Only Friends&#8217; for each option except for &#8216;Add me as a friend&#8217; and &#8216;Send me a message&#8217;. Select &#8216;Everyone&#8217; for both of them.

That&#8217;s it, your Facebook profile will be private again. You can also select any option which you want to share with some or all of them on Facebook by simply selecting &#8216;Friends of Friends or &#8216;Everyone&#8217; except for &#8216;Only Friends&#8217;.
