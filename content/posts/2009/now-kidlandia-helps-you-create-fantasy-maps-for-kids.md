### **The Cost**

  1. You could create a map for free.
  2. Once you have created it online, it can be ordered in prints.
  3. Range: $39.95 for a small sized scroll to almost $180 for a framed, larger sized, high quality map.
  4. Maps can be printed on scrolls, which are easier to carry around, or on canvas that is framed and can be hung.

### Shortcomings

  1. No integration with the web to create a virtual world for kids.
  2. Not very interactive
  3. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/webkinz" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crunchbase.com/company/webkinz', 'Webkinz']);" >Webkinz</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/clubpenguin" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crunchbase.com/company/clubpenguin', 'Disney’s Club Penguin ']);" >Disney’s Club Penguin </a>create <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/05/virtual-world-hangouts-so-many-to-choose-from/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/05/virtual-world-hangouts-so-many-to-choose-from/', 'virtual worlds ']);" >virtual worlds </a>for children to immerse themselves in a fantasy land, and have become increasingly popular.
