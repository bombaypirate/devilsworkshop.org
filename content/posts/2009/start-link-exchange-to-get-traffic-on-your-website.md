Though it is not as powerful as in the past but it’s still very efficient way to form dominance of a website & boost its position in the search engine rankings. So if you have a website and want to have quick traffic link exchange is the perfect idea for you. Let us discuss what actual steps bring a successful link exchange drive.

Link exchange is based on two fundamental things: **quality and relevance. **You have to make a point that the sites you exchange links with are trustworthy & well established with the sources on the internet & are in the same status as your website or relevant in some manner. This gets us to the first phase of linking drive.

## **Keyword Research**

To find related sites one should distinguish the keywords by which these sites can be discovered. Take in a universal list of keywords that you want direct in your search engine optimization drive & elaborate it with keywords of adjacent niches.

## **Searching for Partners to share link**

Doing a search on yahoo & Google & other search engines is the plain way to effectively search possible link partners. Don just concentrate on the very first page of search results. It’s better to start off with the 2nd or 3rd page, since websites that are already at the lead are unlikely to be concerned about starting a link exchange.

## **Find the Best Link Sources**

Now when you have made a list of related websites it is time for quality check. Search engines prefer to have more trust in .gov & .edu websites, hence back links from such domains are much effective. Consider having a link exchange only with those websites that are genuine and are not connected with dubious sites.

## **Set Up Links to Partners**

Before starting to send requests for link exchange to webmasters it&#8217;s better to take the first step before the link exchange & link back to them from your own website.

## **Send Out Link Exchange Requests**

Webmaster get Link exchange requests everyday as a lot of them are generated by link exchange bots, so in order to increase your chances to get a link back, just try to sound as personal & detailed as much possibly. Refer every person by their name and be polite.

## **Manage Your Link Exchange drive**

Just getting a link to your website is not the final stage of the link exchange process. You need to assure that the links remains in place with the right description and address.
