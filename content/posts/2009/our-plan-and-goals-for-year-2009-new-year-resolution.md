I would like to take this as an opportunity to write and share with our readers, our goals and plans for the year ahead. This post may act as a to-do list and a reminder for us as well.

As we are busy doing lots of things, right from expanding our blogging network as well as web-development business, we anticipate a need to re-align our focus areas and organize our daily activities in a better manner.

Many suggestions from our readers and well-wishers have helped us improvise in past year and we hope to continue the efforts in the year 2009 with your support and valuable feedbacks.

The two main areas where we will be focusing our efforts are:

## Devils Workshop and Blog Network‚Ä¶

It is worth notable that Devils Workshop published 423 posts with the help of 20 authors in the year 2008. These figures are good (we feel so) but they do not count many non-technical posts of various domains that were sent to us by different authors.

We started expanding Devils Workshop‚Äôs editorial team in Q4 of year 2008 and within few weeks we realized that we need lot more space on the Internet to accommodate for our rapidly growing family of co-authors and visitors. We have decided to start a full-fledged blog network under its own identity.

As per the current plan we will be formally launching our official and registered blog network by mid February. We have already drafted the list of blogs and the list of probable bloggers that we would be inviting in our expansion.

The entire project plan for the process also includes an exhaustive training session program for people who love to write but are not familiar with the nitty-gritty of this new age media!

We will soon announce the complete details!

## rtCamp (our parent company)

In the process of re-aligning our focus areas in this year:

  * We would be setting up a *‚ÄúSay No‚Äù *cut-off limit for the projects that we undertake, for operational efficiency.
  * Focusing more on complex WordPress, Facebook and OpenSocial related applications.

Here, I would like to acknowledge <a href="http://www.iprash.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.iprash.com/', 'Prashant Karandikar‚Äôs']);" >Prashant Karandikar‚Äôs</a> suggestion that helped us terminate many low-profit projects. This was a crucial business decision and in the end it turned out to be good as we can now focus on things we really love to do and things we are really good at!

rtCamp currently has a small office that accommodates 7 terminals and our goal is to setup 2 offices. One office will be dedicated to blog-network and another one for development work.

### On personal front‚Ä¶

I want to start a personal blog where I can be blunt and unreasonable! It has started feeling boredom in being nice and sophisticated all the time‚Ä¶ after all ‚ÄòDevil‚Äô is what I am supposed to be‚Ä¶ üòâ

That‚Äôs all for the day! Wish you a very happy new year ‚Ä¶ <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Do let us know your plans and goals for new year 2009!
