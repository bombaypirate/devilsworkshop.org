<img class="alignright size-full  wp-image-50036" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/blogcamp-pune-2.jpg" alt="blogcamp-pune-2" />Yesterday, we {[Me][1], [Deepak][2], [Deepesh][3], Radhe, [Shyam][4] & <a href="http://www.anilwadghule.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.anilwadghule.com/', 'Anil']);" >Anil</a>} were at BlogCamp Pune 2 as[ we posted about it earlier][5].

The event was better than expected and around 100 bloggers were gathered despite NO free T-shirt or lunch this time. Glad to see people are seriously camping for the sake of discussion only! ðŸ˜‰

We could not attend entire event but for the first time I presented a talk at any *camp event *(expect rtCamp event)*. ðŸ˜€

The talk was about one of the hottest post on Devils Workshop &#8211; &#8220;[Migrating from Blogger to WordPress without loosing permalinks,Â  traffic & SEO][6]&#8220;. As topic was a bit techie, less number of people turned up for this but we had quality and lengthy discussion at the end.

Those who missed it, can find that <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rahul286/blogger-to-word-press-migration" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.slideshare.net/rahul286/blogger-to-word-press-migration', 'presentation on slideshare']);" >presentation on slideshare</a>.

I was also glad to see <a href="http://thetechnoclub.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thetechnoclub.com/', 'Prateek Dixit']);" >Prateek Dixit</a> ([DW Profile][7]), one of DW&#8217;s guest blogger there. Unfortunately, I could not catch up with him. Sorry Prateek. It would have been great experience interacting with you.

It was great meeting new bloggers {<a href="http://www.krishnanm.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.krishnanm.com/', 'Krishnan']);" >Krishnan</a>, <a href="http://etscientia.wordpress.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://etscientia.wordpress.com/', 'Nikhil']);" >Nikhil</a>, <a href="http://anantshri.info/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://anantshri.info/', 'Anant']);" >Anant</a> and few more} out out there.
