In recent update, Facebook is attracting your friends at services Orkut, Rediff, Terra, UOL and many other. Orkut is hugely popular in India and South America specially Brazil. Rediff is among top portal in India. While Terra & UOL are popular services in Brazil.

Just noticed following welcome message on Facebook.

After following initial instructions, I logged into Orkut and clicked on Bookmarklet as instructed in above screenshot. I was able to invite all friends so easily from Orkut only.

Yesterday, [Sauravjit][1] posted about [Facebook adding support for Indian languages][2] and today they are after users of popular sites in India. This all indicate Facebook is taking expansion in Indian subcontinent seriously. ðŸ˜‰
