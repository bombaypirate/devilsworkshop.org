Google recently <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/now-in-google-toolbar-for-firefox.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/now-in-google-toolbar-for-firefox.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that it has added a new feature to Google toolbar with Firefox browser. You can now read just about any website in different languages. This is quite different from having a translate widget or button on websites. This allows you to read any web-page in a different language. Below is the image of Devilsworkshop translated in Hindi. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Google has released a plethora of applications and options for translating web pages and documents from one language to another recently.

### Translate from Toolbar

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15516" style="border: 1px solid grey" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/10/translate_toolbar_google2.png" alt="translate_toolbar_google2" width="300" height="196" />

  * Google has allowed the Translate button with Google toolbar only with Firefox 3.5 users and above. I guess it will soon be introduced with IE browser in the near future.
  * Just about any web-page can be viewed in many different languages.
  * The Translate feature is synchronized with Private browser feature of Firefox. This mean when you are looking at a website in different languages it turns off features like page history, page rank and side-wiki. The obvious reason for this is that developers might not like their page being ranked or commented on depending on how good the translation of the page is.
  * I have not carried out a extensive study on this but its obvious that some websites will have issues of certain words being translated differently. For instance &#8220;Devils-workshop&#8221; was translated as &#8220;D&#8221;, &#8220;Evil&#8221; and &#8220;workshop&#8221; as different words. So two words were split into three and that can be undesirable.
  * All said and done it is quite a cool feature and very good for people to read websites in different languages. For instance I read a German website by translating it. The English had its faults but I could get the gist of it very well.
