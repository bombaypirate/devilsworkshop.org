  The contest winner of <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/get-a-chance-to-win-rapidshare-premium-account-giveaway/">Rapidshare Premium Account</a> was supposed to be announced on 11th Oct 2009 but because of some issues cropping up in creating the accounts, rtBlogs could not announce the winner earlier. I apologize to all readers and participants especially who might have felt shortchanged as the winner is being announced almost 16 days late. I guarantee this wont happen again.
