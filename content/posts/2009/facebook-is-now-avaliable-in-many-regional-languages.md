Now you can use world&#8217;s best social networking site in your own regional language like-Â  Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, etc.

Although, the site doesn&#8217;t support the text you write in your preferred language, but you can see your friend&#8217;s updates and everything that is written on Facebook in your own language. Most of you can see this new feature on your homepage, and if not, you can go to the language settings page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?language&ref=mf#/editaccount.php?language" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?language&ref=mf#/editaccount.php?language', 'click here']);" target="_blank">click here</a>).

  If you and your friends are using different languages, then don&#8217;t worry about that too! Facebook has its own language translation application. To view the application or to install it <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=4329892722" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=4329892722', 'click here.']);" target="_blank">click here.</a>
