It’s time to say goodbye to Microsoft&#8217;s MSN Web messenger and welcome the new IM in Windows Live Hotmail! The new web-based IM is now available worldwide aiming to provide easier access to communication even while checking emails on Hotmail.

## Features:

  1. Now there is no need to go to MSN Web Messenger to chat. You could simply do it from your hotmail inbox or contact list.
  2. The new integration with the suite of other Windows Live services allows the users to see when their Messenger friends are online while signed in to their inbox
  3. All you have to do is connect directly to the <a href="http://people.live.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://people.live.com/', 'Windows Live People page']);" >Windows Live People page</a> (also called “your contact list”) and sign into Messenger to continue chatting on the Internet with all your Messenger friends, like always.
