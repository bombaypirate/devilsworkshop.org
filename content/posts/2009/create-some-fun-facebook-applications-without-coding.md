LOLapps provides user-generated applications for basically anyone who wants to create, personalize and share social networking applications. Get started with their easy-to-use tools without having to write even a single line of code!

LOLapps powers over 300 thousand applications primarily via their Gift Creator and Quiz Creator platforms. In addition, nearly 2 billion gifts have been sent using LOLapps’ Gift Creator application

Create popular personality quizzes that are so widespread on Facebook and allow people to figure out more about themselves like:

  1. Which character they are in their favorite movie
  2. What teacher in their high school they most represent
  3. What job they should get (or basically anything else you could think of!)

At some time or the other, all Facebook users must have come across some of these quizzes:

  * What Sex and the City character are you?
  * What Greek God are you?
  * What&#8217;s Your Best Quality?
  * Which movie star are you?

Now create sets of virtual gifts for your friends to display on them on their social network profiles. Again, anyone using Facebook would know how popular these are. You could send different gifts on different occasions, be it a holiday, birthday, the launch of your favorite movie, or even things for every day like handbags and candy.

At some time or the other, all Facebook users must have come across some of these gifts:

  * Guardian Angels
  * Because You&#8217;re Special
  * Friendship
  * Knock Me Out Drinks

### Social networks supported?

  * LOLapps currently supports Facebook and Bebo
  * They have plans to expand to additional platforms like MySpace and Hi5.

So let’s get started. Use LOLapps to create your own personalized gift and quiz applications. All you need to do is follow the step-by-step process that will help you customize each application.
