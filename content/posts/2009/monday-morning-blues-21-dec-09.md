Today is another **Monday** morning and I just realized we have reached the last ten days of this year. We are still carrying out tests on the new **[DW redesign project][1]**. I can already see some of your suggestions being followed quiteÂ enthusiastically.

<img class="size-full wp-image-18043 alignnone" title="Monday 21 December" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/mmb_211209.png" alt="Monday 21 December" width="334" height="290" />

### Subscribers are 7000 +

One very important thing I have to share with you as many of you visiting Devils Workshop might have noticed it that we have now crossed 7000 subscribers. This is quite satisfying personally as when I joined **rtBlogs **over three months ago we were around the 5000+ mark.

### Top Posts

  * [How to Improve IE8 Self-protection in Windows 7?][2] by [Bob Newman][3].
  * [Send Your Blog Feeds To Twitter Using Feedburner][4] by [Richie S][5].
  * [Will Google Nexus be a misadventure?][6] by [Aditya Kane][7] (that&#8217;s me).
  * [Replace the bloats and speed up your computer][8] by [Umesh][9].
  * [Home Surveillance Through Skype][10] by [Gaurav][11].

Finally I realized that next **Monday** would be the last one in this year. So with nextÂ Monday&#8217;sÂ **Top Posts** I will include the posts you liked over the whole year. Let me know through your comments which were you favorite posts in the whole year and I will include the most popular ones on Top Posts list. Obviously the list would be much longer than 5. ðŸ˜‰
