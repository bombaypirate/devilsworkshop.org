Apparently, the Iranian elections last week resulted in a lot of information in Persian being exchanged over Facebook, about the election results and aftermath. The people, however, had to navigate the site in English (or some other supported language).

The beta version of Facebook in Persian is now available, making it easier and more convenient for Persian speakers around the globe to use Facebook.

2. Select your primary language for the browser as Persian from the drop down menu.

3. Once the browser is set, to Persian, you will automatically see the Persian version of Facebook.

This move is likely to attract more Persian speakers around the world to join Facebook and communicate better.
