## Partners

Some of the Google partners will include:

  * Acer
  * Adobe
  * ASUS
  * Freescale
  * Hewlett-Packard
  * Lenovo
  * Qualcomm
  * Texas Instruments
  * Toshiba

## What does this mean?

  * Acer and Asus are among the top netbook manufacturers worldwide.
  * Also, with Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, Google could be looking to tap into the mobile market.
  * Partnership with Adobe could mean Flash in Chrome?

The OS will be available for **free**.

> *“Speed, simplicity and security are the key aspects of Google Chrome OS. We&#8217;re designing the OS to be fast and lightweight, to start up and get you onto the web in a few seconds. The user interface is minimal to stay out of your way, and most of the user experience takes place on the web. And as we did for the Google Chrome browser, we are going back to the basics and completely redesigning the underlying security architecture of the OS so that users don&#8217;t have to deal with viruses, malware and security updates. It should just work.”*

Let’s wait to see what these partnerships yield for Google.
