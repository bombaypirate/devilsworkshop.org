It&#8217;s another major change in facebook since last month and this time they are going to change all the link of profiles on facebook. Unlike earlier, where the URL was just a random number assigned to the profile like

http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=**1043785484**

Now it will be like,

http://www.facebook.com/Sauravjit

**The reason** of changing the profile ids with their username is to make it easier for people to find their friends on facebook. Also with new URLs people will be able to find their friends easily on search engines like Google or Yahoo.

The facebook users will be able to select their new usernames from 12:01 a.m. EDT on Saturday, June 13 which is 9:31 a.m in IST(Indian Standard Time),which is totally on the first come first serve basis.So just stick to facebook to get your desired username before anybody else takes it. ðŸ˜‰
