Every now and then winds of change come to **D****evils Workshop** and presently we are in one such situation. After getting some random suggestions and feedback from our readers we have decided to make changes to **Devils Workshop&#8217;s** design.

So now the **Devils** (<a href="http://rtcamp.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com', 'rtCamp']);" >rtCamp</a> Developers and Web Designers) are all in the workshop implementing ideas and testing them.

### Your opinions matter&#8230;

We are fiercely proud of our readers and contributors as they constantly keep suggesting changes through email or random comments. We have kept some suggestions in mind before taking this road to redesign, but we want more opinions and ideas from you. Best way to do this is to comment to this post. Rest assured we will be monitoring the comments very closely for ideas.

If you have an idea, as suggestion do write in a comment to let us know and we will try to work with those ideas. If you do not have any ideas then the best way to help us would be to write in what you like in the present design through your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
