Actually few days ago, I wanted to merge some of my PDF files into a single PDF file. I was tinkering in <a href="http://www.devilsworkshop.org" target="_blank">Devils Workshop</a> thinking some of my co-bloggers must have made an entry about it here. But I didnâ€™t find anything relevant and it is then, I felt writing about it, so that, my visitors atleast wonâ€™t be in trouble some time in the future. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  After Googling for such a tool, I came across an online tool- <a href="http://www.mergepdf.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mergepdf.net/', 'Merge PDF']);" target="_blank"><strong>Merge PDF</strong></a>, that helped me merge my PDF files too easily and importantly for free. ðŸ˜‰ Just head over to <a href="http://www.mergepdf.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mergepdf.net/', 'MergePDF.net']);" target="_blank">MergePDF.net</a> and you will be asked to upload the files that you need to merge. Upload the PDF files in the order you want to merge them, and it will immediately merge them and provide you the download link of the merged file. Isnâ€™t it how easy to merge PDF files even without any PDF editors installed?
