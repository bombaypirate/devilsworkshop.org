If you are among those who have been depending mainly on <a href="http://images.google.co.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://images.google.co.in', 'Google Image Search']);" title="Google Image Search"  target="_self">Google Image Search</a> for the pictures to be inserted in your slide shows, blogs, etc., things won&#8217;t be the same after you have completed reading this article.

Since <a href="http://www.bing.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bing.com', 'Bing']);" title="Bing"  target="_self">Bing</a> was launched on 1st of this month, there has been a lot of buzz surrounding it and its threat to Google. Well, let&#8217;s see where <a href="http://www.bing.com/?scope=images&nr=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bing.com/?scope=images&nr=1', 'Bing&#8217;s Image Search']);" title="Bing Image Search"  target="_self">Bing&#8217;s Image Search</a> stands in comparison to Google Image Search.

Let&#8217;s see the differences under the following criteria:

## 1. Search Accuracy

**Basis: ** The relevance to the searched term and the quality of the first 15 images returned by both the search engines.

While Google was good as ever, Bing was right on target almost every time, as in to exclaim: BINGo!! That&#8217;s what I was looking for. (In fact, I gave Bing Image search a try only when simple search terms like &#8211; &#8216;follow on facebook&#8217; and &#8216;hello&#8217; forced me to go to the 3rd page of Google Images.)

## 2. User Interface

** Basis: ** Ease of use, including that of the <a href="#sortingoptions" target="_self">additional image sorting options</a>.

Google&#8217;s additional <a href="#sortingoptions" target="_self">image sorting options </a>on the top bar aren&#8217;t that obvious. On the other hand, Bing has dedicated a full left column to it, leave apart its elegant look and <a href="#sortingoptions" target="_self">&#8220;show similar images&#8221; </a>option below every image on hovering.

<img class="size-full wp-image-10108 alignleft" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/google-options.gif" alt="google-options" width="413" height="107" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10122" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/left1.gif" alt="left1" width="150" height="225" />

Moreover, when it comes to pagination, **Bing** Image Search has none !! Surprised? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> **You just need to keep scrolling down** till you find what you want. That reduces search time drastically.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10098" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/pagination.gif" alt="pagination" width="287" height="99" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10114" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/bing1.gif" alt="bing1" width="221" height="104" />

<div id="sortingoptions">
  <h2>
    3. Image sorting options
  </h2>
</div>

This is one field where Bing has clearly surpassed Google. The &#8220;**Show similar Images**&#8221; option below every image on hovering works like a charm. Its other options like: sort by **Size, Layout, Color, Style, People** appears to be more efficient and useful than the fewer: sort by size, content and color options provided by Google.

Moreover, Bing offers 4 Image viewing options: &#8221; Zoom Small, Medium, Large and Show Image details&#8221;  (top right corner).

Even while viewing a particular image in Bing, you can see the related images displayed in the left column giving a Youtube like feel for Images.

## Conclusion

Though in some aspects, like searching for clip arts and line drawings,  Google image search is still unique, its very evident that **Bing has done its homework really well**. As far as Image search is concerned, Bing deserves a pat on the back for raising the bar.

With Google known for its simplicity and obsession for statistics rather than looks, its interesting to see how Microsoft has made a thorough analysis of all the possible weaknesses of Google Image Search and tried to overcome them in style. Lets see what changes Bing forces onto Google. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
