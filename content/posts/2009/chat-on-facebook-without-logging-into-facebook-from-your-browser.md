Facebook chat is becoming as popular as google chat now a days. With people being on facebook 24&#215;7, it is imperative to them that an easier method of chatting with friends on facebook with facebook chat should be available. After all, one can&#8217;t keep that facebook page open all the time in the browser!

I&#8217;m going to share with you a rather simple (but effective) way of being on Facebook 24&#215;7 and chatting with your Facebook friends while browsing any website.

  * To get your facebook chat your browser sidebar, simply go to your Bookmarks Manager. (Ctrl+Shift+B for **windows**, Ctrl+Shift+O for **linux**)
  * Go to Organize &#8211;> and type the following address:

> **http://www.facebook.com/presence/popout.php**

  * You&#8217;ll notice a tiny checkbox at the bottom, saying &#8220;*Load this bookmark in the sidebar&#8221; *Check that.
  * Now save the bookmark in the bookmark toolbar so that the Facebook Chat could be opened with a single click.

Hurray!! You&#8217;re done! Now, you can chat with your Facebook friends, without even being on Facebook.
