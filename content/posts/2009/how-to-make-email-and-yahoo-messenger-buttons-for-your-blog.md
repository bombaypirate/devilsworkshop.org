But those days are gone when you give full e-mail address on your blog like &#8220;For any queries contact us at admin@example.com&#8221;. Nobody has time to copy the address, open his mailbox and go to compose mail. And even all of this is not at all required when you can do all this with just one click.Not only this you can also launch the Yahoo messenger window with a single click. All you need to know is the correct codes for both of them.

### **E-Mails:**

mailto:admin@example.com

use your e-mail id in place of admin@example.com

**Implementation:**

to use it in html use

<a href=&#8221;mailto:admin@example.com&#8221;>Mail the Author</a>

If you further want to add the subject of e-mail just modify above code with,

<a href=&#8221;mailto:admin@example.com?subject=This is your subject&#8221;>Mail the Author</a>

Change &#8220;This is your subject&#8221; to whatever you want in subject field.You don not need to add target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; mailto automatically opens in a new window.

### **Yahoo Messenger:**

For yahoo messenger use the code

ymsgr:sendIM?singh_77s

Replace Singh_77s with your own messenger id.

**Implementation:**

<a href=&#8221;ymsgr:sendIM?singh_77s&#8221;>Send us Y im</a>

The html knowledge needed for them is just basic, the main part is the codes.If you need further assistance, ask them using the comments below.
