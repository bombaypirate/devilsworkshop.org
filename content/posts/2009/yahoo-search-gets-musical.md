Yesterday I wrote about Google trying to help people search for music with [Google Music Search][1]. I wondered about other search engines and how good they were while handling music related search queries. This is when I came across an <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/2009/10/28/play-that-funky-music-with-yahoo-search/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ysearchblog.com/2009/10/28/play-that-funky-music-with-yahoo-search/', 'article online']);" >article online</a> which was announcing how <a href="http://search.yahoo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://search.yahoo.com', 'Yahoo Search']);" >Yahoo Search</a> was also a great way to search music.

While Google has made its <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/music/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/landing/music/', 'Music search']);" >Music search</a> more subtle along with its Search Engine, Yahoo seems to do a better job with it. Taking a closer look I realized this was not at all surprising considering <a href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://new.music.yahoo.com/', 'Yahoo Music']);" >Yahoo Music</a>, a beta product was being promoted with the search results.

### Yahoo Search for Music

  1. The first thing that isÂ strikingÂ is the way there are links to listen to music. Most of these links allowed me to listen to songs through **Rhapsody**. There is also another link to listen to more songs. This leads you directly to the <a href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://new.music.yahoo.com/', 'Yahoo Music']);" >Yahoo Music</a> page. This is still in beta stage and I think later on Yahoo might push the service moreÂ aggressively.
  2. Music videos are also something that is crucial to sell music and I could look up related videos of my search query. This looked a lot similar to how <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/music/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/landing/music/', 'Google Search']);" >Google Search</a> deals with music queries. I wonder who got inspired by whom. ðŸ˜‰
  3. Finally to the left there are related links to Wikipedia, VH1, Rhapsody and Last fm. This is where **Yahoo Search** will be looking to monetize this search feature with tie ups with Rhapsody. This enables the user to buy music online.

I did not get to check out <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/music/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/landing/music/', 'Google&#8217;s Music Search']);" >Google&#8217;s Music Search</a> as it is still work under progress and mainly restricted to the US. But I liked what I got from Yahoo and felt that we do not have to like everything that Google does and there are still some reasons to visit Yahoo. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
