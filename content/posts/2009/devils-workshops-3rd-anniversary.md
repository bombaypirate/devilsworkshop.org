Today Devils Workshop has completed **3 years** and like previous anniversaries, you will get lots of surprises, which is our way of thanking to all who love & support Devils Workshop through out the year!

So here we goes&#8230;

### #1. Free search engine & other optimization services for 2 wordpress blogs

As part of our anniversary celebration we are offering our search engine & other optimization services for 2 lucky blogs. If you run a **wordpress** blog, you can participate in this. Sorry guys but those who take pain or pleasure in writing for Devils Workshop should get more perks! ðŸ˜‰

This package covers things like optimization configuration, theme and other part of your wordpress blog for better performance in search engine as well as humans. It is more like consultancy with technical support. We normally charge **$300** for this and it takes around one week to tweak a blog!

### #2. Free Blogger To WordPress Migration for 2 blogs (and more)

After our mega post on [**Blogger To WordPress Migration**][2] we received many requests regarding <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/', 'paid migration service']);" >paid migration service</a>. We normally charge **$200** for it but we decided to give away this service completely free for 2 of our readers, including guest authors.

So if you are running your blog on **Blogger** (Blogspot.com) and looking for experts to migrate your blog to WordPress (self-hosted), then this is your chance.

### To participate:** **

Simply** **<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=ckdFVDRlS3RtSFlVenVRR1pnS1ZXeGc6MA.." onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=ckdFVDRlS3RtSFlVenVRR1pnS1ZXeGc6MA..']);" >fill up this form</a>. It is common form for both. Check appropriate check-box on form at the end. ** Date of last submission is 19th June 10:00PM (IST).**

If you ever [guest authored on Devils Workshop][3] in past, don&#8217;t forget to enter your Devils Workshop username in the form.

### More is on the cards&#8230;**  
**

Above services are worth** $1000**! But I hate one thing about them! They are all for bloggers. What about non-bloggers???

Well this is not the end. As per [our promise][4], we will keep surprising you for rest of the month and in next round we will surely bring some gifts for non-blogger readers. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
