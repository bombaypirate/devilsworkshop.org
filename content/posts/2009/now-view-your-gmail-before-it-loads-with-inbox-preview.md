With the help of this new feature, you will now be able to see a static preview of your inbox with your latest ten messages displayed, while Gmail is loading.

This means that if you don’t have any new messages waiting for you, you don’t really need to wait for Gmail to load. This feature will really come in handy for people who are looking to save time on slower internet connections, where Gmail could sometimes take a while to load.

### **To enable this feature:**

  1. Login to your Gmail account
  2. Go to Setting > Labs
  3. Scroll down to “Inbox Preview” from the list
  4. Select Enable
  5. Save changes

Well, I am not sure how many of you will find this feature exciting. The usability of &#8220;Inbox Preview&#8221; is inversely proportional to your internet speed. Said that, this feature might be very useful for me while travelling when I use my data card.
