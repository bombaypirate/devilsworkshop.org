## Features

Once you are signed in, you can create and host a personal chat room. You have the option to keep it as **public **or **private **and choose the number of people you wish to invite.

Here is a list of things you could do:

  * Create and host your own chat room
  * Make your chat room public or private with password protection
  * Send direct messages to 1 or more users within a room
  * Schedule when your room is open
  * Invite your Facebook friends

## Process

  * Log into the chat either through Facebook Connect or Twitter OAuth.
  * Once logged in, your chat updates will have your profile picture along with a small icon. The icon will tell whether a person is from Twitter or Facebook.
  * You could click on the picture to go to that personâ€™s profile page.

## Privacy controls

The chat room creator has a lot control over the room like:

  * Setting chat durations
  * Setting Twitter hashtags that will be tweeted out anytime someone tweets from the room.
  * Sending your chat updates through this tool by clicking the checkbox.

Finally, a practical solution that brings Facebook and Twitter users closer than ever! Quickly, easily and for free!
