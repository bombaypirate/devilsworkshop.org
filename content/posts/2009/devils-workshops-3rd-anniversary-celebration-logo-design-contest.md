[Devils Workshop&#8217;s 3rd Anniversary Celebration][1]! In [last contest][1], some of readers showed interest in designing new logo for Devils Workshop!</p> 

We right now have no plans to make any major changes to DW theme. But we need some artwork for our new, upcoming two blogs. Yes, rtBlogs network will be introducing two more blogs by the end of July. Like current <a href="http://rtblogs.com/blog-list/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com/blog-list/', 'blogs in our network']);" >blogs in our network</a>, you will get chance to write and earn on those blog as well once blog goes live but till for all creative minds out there, here is a small contest.

## About our upcoming blogs&#8230;

We are planning to launch 2 new blogs on different but related topic. Name and some other details are below.

### 1. BlogVeda

This will be our blog for all new bloggers. Main focus of this blog will be blogging, SEO, online money making and related topics. We hope many of our readers will find this useful.

This blog will have some special sections. We cannot reveal more details about this at present but I hope name and this small intro is sufficient to get you started.

### 2. WpVeda

WordPress is backbone of <a href="http://rtblogs.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com/', 'our blog network']);" >our blog network</a> and is also focus of our parent company. Initial idea was to create a wiki for internal usage where our developers can dump helpful information related to wordpress making collaboration easier. This idea is now base of our new blog dedicated to wordpress.

This will be more developer centric blog with less frequent update. We will share wordpress tutorials, themes and plugins form this new blog only. This blog will also have occasional web development and web designing tutorial.
