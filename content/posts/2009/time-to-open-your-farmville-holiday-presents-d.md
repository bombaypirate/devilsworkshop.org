The wait is finally over and it&#8217;s the time to open all your Blue, Pink, Green, Red and Brown holiday special presents that you collected in &#8216;Holiday Tree&#8217; of FarmVille. The &#8216;Holiday Tree&#8217; which is having a capacity of 100 gifts is having all your gifts that you received from your friends but you can&#8217;t open them as these are meant for the Christmas and New Year&#8217;s holiday season.

Just few minutes back I opened few of my presents. The gifts I got are good and useful but mostly are just for decoration of your farm. Out of thirty there were around 10-15 golden soldiers and silver ornament but I wan not able toÂ  open other gifts and neither you can as the gift box&#8217;s capacity is of 30 gifts at a time. So you have to open few presents and then either place it in your farm or store them in store house. The best present I got was the **5 containers of fuel** that is very useful for harvester, seeder or tractor.

To open your presents just click on the &#8216;Holiday Tree&#8217; and select look inside. You have to open present one by one. The presents can still be sent or received till 7th of January. So like regular FacebooKnol readers if you want to get a free present everyday on FarmVille just read this* [<a title="Link to Easiest way to get a free farmville gift everyday" rel="bookmark" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2009/11/30/easiest-way-to-get-a-free-farmville-gift-everyday/">Easiest way to get a free farmville gift everyday</a>]*.
