I first thought it was a bit of a joke but the Gmail only device does exist and its called Gboard.

### About <a href="http://www.gboard.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gboard.com/', 'G Board']);" >G Board</a>

  * This keybopard or rather keypad like device connects from a USB.
  * All its needs is a recent Windows OS or a Mac OS.
  * It needs browser which is recent. The website does not specify how recent but I assume all the builds over the last couple of years.
  * It is priced at $19.99.

### Niche Devices and their need?

This is obviously a niche device and let me make it clear I am not really a fan of niche devices. I had once read about a device meant only for Twitter. A lot of experts panned it because it was priced almost as much as a smart phone.

The case with **G Board** is similar too. But I think it&#8217;s not really meant to be a functional entity but more like a collectors item for Gmail fans.

What do you think about such devices ? Do you think it&#8217;s a waste of time or do you think it has its own purposes? Do let me know through your comments.
