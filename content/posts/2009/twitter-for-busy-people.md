You could see up to 500 friends at once, and you could check the recent history of any of your friends in an easy and effortless way.

## Features

  1. See what your friends have been up to &#8220;at a glance&#8221;.
  2. Check out the status messages of less active friends that get pushed far down the page or even off the page completely.
  3. See up to 500 friends at once.

## Screenshots

**Get a general picture of your friends and hover your mouse over the pictures to read the gist, like this:**
