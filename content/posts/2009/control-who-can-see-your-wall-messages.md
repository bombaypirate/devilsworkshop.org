**Facebook** has now brought about better privacy features and more importantly given you more control over the messages you write on your wall.

Often I would post something on my wall or leave a status message but it was irrelevant for a lot of people in my friend list. Lets say I was announcing to my friends about a school reunion. This would obviously be useless for my **Facebook friends **who are my colleagues.

Now with the **new privacy** features you can actually select a group of friends or even individuals who can see wall post or even status message.

### Customize Wall Posts

  * Start typing your message on the **Wall text box**. After you are done with the message click on the **Lock** icon to the right had corner next to **Share**.
  * **Everyone **is selected by default, ideally to select one individual or group of friends click on **Customize.**
  * Now once you click on Customize a new interface pops up and allows you to control exactly who amongst your friends can see the message and also who cannot see the message.
  * Below is a video I created on how exactly **Facebook Wall privacy** can be tweaked.

Hope you like it and let me know what you think about this feature through your comments! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
