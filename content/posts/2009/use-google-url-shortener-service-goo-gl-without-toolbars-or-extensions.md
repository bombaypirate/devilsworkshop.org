**Google** has recently launched its URL shortener service **<a href="http://goo.gl/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://goo.gl/', 'Goo.gl']);" >Goo.gl</a> **and it has got a lot of coverage. I was just doing to catching up with some blog reading and I found that it is full of excited praise for Goo.gl.

**Goo.gl URL shortener **should be quite a big thing, considering **Google** is big fish on the Internet. But currently it can be only used by using Google Toolbar if you are using **Internet Explorer** or **Firefox**. It also has support through an extension which can be installed on **Chrome**.

**Feedburner** can also be used to create short URL using **Goo.gl** but there is no website by Google where I could go to and use this service. That problem was solved thanks to a <a href="http://gaigalas.net/lab/googl" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gaigalas.net/lab/googl', 'website']);" >website</a> I came across.

  * <a href="http://gaigalas.net/lab/googl" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gaigalas.net/lab/googl', 'Gaigalas.net']);" >Gaigalas.net</a> is a website which is run by <a href="http://gaigalas.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gaigalas.net/', 'Alexandre Gaigalas']);" >Alexandre Gaigalas</a>. Once at the website I could simply type in the URL I wanted and click on **Shorten**.
  * This created a short URL using **<a href="http://goo.gl/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://goo.gl/', 'Goo.gl']);" >Goo.gl</a>**.
  * This website is not run by Google and the service is still in testing mode. I used it to shorten **[DW][1]** URL and it works.

Do you know of any such services with respect to Goo.gl? Let me know through your comments.

**Editor&#8217;s Note: **You can also read the review of how to use Goo.gl URL shortener service with a [Firefox Addon][2] (not Google toolbar) and with a [Bookmarklet][2].
