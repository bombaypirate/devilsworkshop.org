Here are the two new features introduced:

  1. <div align="justify">
      Support for attaching multiple files.
    </div>

  2. <div align="justify">
      Status bar to show progress of upload.
    </div>

**1**. Using the multiple file attachment feature, you can attach as many files while composing mails in Gmail. It means you need not use the option of ‘Attach another file’ for attaching multiple files from a single directory. This is nothing but the multi select option that we normally use while performing tasks locally.   
[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 5px 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="159" alt="" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/multiselect-thumb.jpg" width="404" border="0" />][2]&#160;   
Just press ‘Ctrl’ key (Cmd in case of OS X) and select as many files, of course the total file size should not exceed Gmail’s attachment limit. 

**2**. Unlike other upload services or other mail services, earlier, Gmail did not show up status of how much part of the file has been uploaded, but today, along with multiple file selection service, Gmail has added support to show the status of uploaded file.   
[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 5px 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="159" alt="" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/progress-bars-thumb.jpg" width="404" border="0" />][3]&#160;

Personally, the previous feature is not much useful for me, but the later one (status bars) is really a good feature, because it will keep you updated if you are uploading a big file, say 8 or 10 MB.
