Amazon Kindle Publishing for Blogs is a fast and easy self-publishing tool that lets you upload your blog for sale in the Kindle Store.

### What is an Amazon Kindle?

****

For those of you who don’t know, let me briefly explain what an Amazon Kindle is?

It is a wireless and a portable reading device, with an electronic-paper display with a sharp, high-resolution screen that looks and reads just like real paper. [If you wish to learn more, Click here.][2]

### More about the newly added feature

****

This happens to be a pretty interesting feature – all your blogs get auto-published  wirelessly to your readers&#8217; Kindle and get updated throughout the day. Pretty cool!

  * As per this feature, the blogs will be fully downloaded onto the Kindle so that they can be read even when the user is not connected wirelessly.
  * The blogs displayed on the Kindle will have complete text content and images (most of them), which is unlike RSS readers that often only provide headlines.

Anyone can make their blogs available through this new <a href="http://kindlepublishing.amazon.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kindlepublishing.amazon.com', 'Kindle Publishing for Blogs Beta']);" >Kindle Publishing for Blogs Beta</a> program.

### How to get started?

  1. <a href="https://kindlepublishing.amazon.com/gp/vendor/registration" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://kindlepublishing.amazon.com/gp/vendor/registration', 'Create a new account']);" >Create a new account</a> by following 3 easy steps as follows: 
      * Create your login information
      * Set up your security questions
      * Fill out the Vendor Set Up form
  2. In the Vendor Set Up form you will need to do the following: 
      * Provide your contact information
      * Provide your payment information
      * Accept the terms and conditions
  3. Once done with the setup, upload your blog using the “**Add a Blog**” page. Your blog should be up and ready to go in the Kindle Store after about 12 to 48 hours of processing.

### Let’s talk MONEY!

  1. Sadly, you can’t set the subscription price for your blog. Amazon will define the price. Exactly how much Amazon will charge for each blog isn’t clear yet. (Most blogs currently go for $1.99 a month!)
  2. You will get paid 30% of the monthly blog subscription price for every subscriber to your blog.

### How useful is it?

****

I am not sure how many people would like to make use of it. Unless your reader base has a sufficient Kindle user base, this option might not make much difference. Mainly because to use this privilege, they will have to pay!

This doesn’t seem like a big source of income for bloggers. Moreover, the Kindle market is way too small, and the people who will pay for blogs on it is even less. However, there isn’t any harm to try out a new market to monetize your blog further.
