George Hotz is a 19 year old Google employee who released the first jailbreak app for [Apple’s iPhone 3GS][1], just two weeks after the iPhone was introduced!

We release, Apple fixes, we find new holes. It isn&#8217;t worth waiting because you might have the &#8220;last&#8221; hole in the iPhone. What last hole&#8230; this isn&#8217;t golf. I&#8217;ll find a new one next week.”*

## Jailbreaking the iPhone 3GS

This application lets you install any program directly onto the iPhone. And this includes applications that are not from Apple as well.

Hotz, on his blog also provides a step-by-step explanation of what users need to do to jailbreak the iPhone 3GS and also said that a jailbreak for the Mac OS is coming soon.

### Prepared to get started?

**Warning:** Hotz says that this tool is in beta, so the user should make sure to have everything backed up before running it.

Here are some of the things he suggests to get started:

  * Go to <a href="http://purplera1n.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://purplera1n.com', 'purplera1n.com']);" >purplera1n.com</a>
  * Download the app
  * Make sure you have the following: 
      * Windows (and not 7) installed
      * The latest iTunes installed
      * iPhone 3GS with 3.0 firmware
  * Connect to your iPhone
  * Click &#8220;make it ra1n&#8221; and wait.
  * On bootup, run Freeze, the purplera1n installer app.

From here on, it should be easy to figure out what needs to be done next. In case not, then the users can e-mail purplera1n support or call a support hotline.

## Some failed Jailbreaking attempts

While many have thanked and appreciated Hotz for this app via comments on the post, some users have posted concerns about their jailbreaking attempts.

  * Some iPhone 3GS owners had a frozen iPhone after installing WinterBoard. It is an open-source app that allows users to apply themes to their iPhone.
  * Some complained of the iPhone crashing, going into safe mode, and then freezing.

Share you comments on what you think or problems you may have encountered.
