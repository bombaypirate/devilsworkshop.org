How can anyone not include this? One of the earliest sites to offer custom image effects on your own images. This site allows your images to appear as if it was the on the cover of any magazine or comic book. The magazine templates though do not many include famous ones, but there are some like vague.

Another wonderful site that allows your images to appear on tea-cups, bill-boards, magazine, art galleries&#8230;there are so many effects! The site currently boasts of more than  100 designs or ready-made templates. One special feature of this site is that some effects require your face to appear properly. For this the site has implemented face recognition technology. Pretty neat!

Originally started as a site to cartoonize your image, or add a cartoonish effect to your pictures, it now has 9 effects that include the cartoonizer (cartoon effect), inkify (drawn with ink), scribbler (pencil effect) and many more.  The most special feature of this site is that all of the image editing happens inside a flash application.

A relatively new entrant into the field of image editing, this site offers the option of putting our slogans on pre-taken images. That is you get the template wherein a person is holding a placard. In this placard you can fill the slogan of your choice. Other effects include  magazine covers, background-images and putting your face on a celebrity&#8217;s body (Face in Hole mode.)

These four are my personal best&#8217;s. I&#8217;ve used it over and over and it still amazes me. Do you know of any more such sites?
