### &#8220;Blogger Of The Month&#8221; for September 2009

This post is to announce &#8220;<a href="http://rtblogs.com/blogger-of-the-month/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com/blogger-of-the-month/', 'Blogger Of The Month']);" >Blogger Of The Month</a>&#8221; for September 2009.

In September 2009, **82 posts** were published by guest authors. Out of 82, more than half, i.e. **48 posts** were made by guest authors [Sauravjit Singh][1] and [Gaganpreet Singh][2]. Well this obviously mean one of these guys must be a winner!

Even though Ganganpreet scored more points per post i.e. **3.95** over Sauravjit&#8217;s **3.12**, Sauravjit&#8217;s facebook addiction at <a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/', 'facebooknol']);" >facebooknol</a> helped him win &#8220;Blogger of The Month&#8221; for September 2009.

This is second time, Sauravjit won in row. It seems from live scoreboard for Blogger of The Month, that Sauravjit would be going for hat-trick as he is leading October 2009 by major difference. But let me share an insider scoop with you! Sauravjit will be busy with exams for next few days so&#8230; üòâ

Below is detailed scorecard for **Blogger Of The Month &#8211; September 2009**

### Very Important Reminder

We made it clear from time to time that &#8220;Blogger Of The Month&#8221; is award given across entire blog network. So don&#8217;t be surprised if someone wins without posting many articles on DW.

In fact, one doesn&#8217;t need to be techie at all to win &#8220;Blogger of The Month&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t know yet, we have a completely non-technical blog in network i.e. <a href="http://www.crictalks.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crictalks.com/', 'CricTalks']);" >CricTalks</a> dedicated for Cricket!

### Expanding AdSense Sharing

There are 2 reasons most guest bloggers prefer to write for DW than other blogs in our network. DW gets decent traffic, around 7000 daily page views, and adsense revenue sharing in place.

Our relatively new blog like facebooknol didn&#8217;t have adsense sharing implemented till date. As part of our internal rules, we do not put ads on any site that gets less than 200 daily pageviews.

As of now our all sites, crossed this barrier so we are addressing this issue in coming 2-3 days.

### Probable AdSense Sharing Downtime

Till date we were using patched up version of <a href="http://www.harleyquine.com/php-scripts/author-adsense-plugin/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.harleyquine.com/php-scripts/author-adsense-plugin/', 'Harley&#8217;s author adsense plugin']);" >Harley&#8217;s author adsense plugin</a>. This worked amazingly on wordpress non-mu version but we faced lots of problem on MU with it.

Yesterday only our senior developers <a href="http://rtcamp.com/about/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/about/', 'Santa']);" >Santa</a> (aka Santosh Kamble) and <a href="http://rtcamp.com/about/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/about/', 'Radhe']);" >Radhe</a> (aka Radhakrishnan Mudliar) completed AdSense revenue sharing plugin for MU. As we will be migrating to this new plugin, it may happen all AdSense all from DW may disappear for few minutes. So do not panic if you don&#8217;t see your ads on your posts for few minutes!
