Yahoo! Meme is the new micro-blogging service from Yahoo is now open to all. I decided to check out what was all the fuss was about and came away with mixed feelings.

I liked its layout even though it felt a bit like Twitter, the idea of sharing videos, images and audio seems to be novel and as far as options go, makes it more versatile than Twitter.

### Yahoo Meme

  * The layout is very similar to Twitter. But you can share images from your desktop, post mp3 links for audio and share videos from YouTube or Vimeo.
  * The concept of ReTweet becomes Repost which is something they have clearly borrowed from Twitter. There is also Popular section which shows the post which has been reposted the most number of times.
  * Something they borrowed from Facebook was the option to comment on other peoples posts.
  * Yahoo Meme takes a different path from Twitter when it comes to the number ofÂ charactersÂ you can enter. At Twitter its 140 with a focus on updates from mobile phones and with Yahoo Meme the limit is 2000Â characters.

So now you have a social networking site which has borrowed somethings from Twitter and Facebook. It seems to be confused on who it wants to challenge or what exactly it wants to give internet users. It surely does not have anything really different from other websites for people to actively want to be a part of Yahoo Meme. It still is early days but at the moment it just looks like Yahoo Meme is a clone of Twitter without the high number of users. ðŸ˜‰
