<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5739" title="model & poloroid pics" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/04/44-272x300.jpg" alt="poloroid pic" width="245" height="270" />Would you like to see yourself on an ad banner in NYC? Get clicked with a movie star? Pose as a model flaunting a perfect hourglass figure? Or, even better, on the cover page of Vogue magazine? Ever wanted to sport Superman? Or just wanted to be an artists&#8217; wonder on his canvas?

If you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;I wish&#8230; but could I?&#8221;, then the answer is &#8211; Yes! all this and more is possible and the good news is that it&#8217;s only a few clicks away.

### Busted! A funny story&#8230;

Recently a friend of mine uploaded some of her pictures on Orkut that caught my attention. I was surprised to see her posing for ads on huge hoardings.

I knew she was an aspiring model, but never realized she made it this big so soon! I got suspicious when one of her pictures had Victoria Beckham in it. Although the results were super realistic, but in this case she just pushed her luck too far, don&#8217;t you think? ðŸ˜›

### About the service that makes it all happen&#8230;

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5827" title="Vogue" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/04/16-150x150.jpg" alt="Vogue" width="150" height="150" />Some of you would already know about this service through an [earlier post on Devils Workshop][1], however, for those who don&#8217;t, this service is provided by &#8211; <a href="http://www.photofunia.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.photofunia.com', 'photofunia']);" title="http://www.photofunia.com">photofunia</a> &#8211;Â  a must visit for an amusing and a fun-filled experience.

This photo editing tool works on face detection technology that automatically identifies the face in a picture uploaded by you and creates crazy montages. All you have to do is choose any effect from their library, and upload the photo of your choice to it. Rest gets taken care of&#8230; simple!

### Here&#8217;s your chance to get creative&#8230;

So, why don&#8217;t you try this out for yourself? It&#8217;s a lot of fun and you will be surprised to see how realistic the results can get. Here are some of the things you could attempt in your spare time:

  1. Run your imagination wild and **play a photo-prank **on someone (hmm&#8230; now this could be a risky business&#8230; so don&#8217;t go over board in doing this&#8230; haha)
  2. Create **personalized postcards **for your friends and family (unfortunately, people hardly engage in doingÂ  such things anymore)
  3. Make your own **greeting cards **for Birthdays, Christmas, New Years, etc.
  4. Create your **personal calendar **with the photos of your own choice<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5768" title="on the wall" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/04/321-269x300.jpg" alt="on the wall" width="206" height="230" />
  5. Or even better &#8211; create your own **portfolio**!
