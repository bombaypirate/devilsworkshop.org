Once again Facebook is under maintenance for the next 24 hours due to some technical difficulties. I have to use the word &#8216;again&#8217; cause last month was full of technical difficulties too mostly of which are related to Login problems, due to which users were getting error messages like of &#8216;Site Maintenance&#8217;,

Well let me clear you one thing, this kind of error messages doesn&#8217;t mean that you are blocked by Facebook and you cannot access your account again in future, that&#8217;s just an temporary error.

The maintenance started four hours back ( 7:30 a.m 07-10-09 IST ) due to which some of your profiles won&#8217;t be available. I think they are also gonna fix the chatting bug which is not working smoothly and you have to open the chat window again and again to enable typing.

They will try to resolve it within 24 hours however it may take more time too. Most of the profile between this maintenance period will work properly without any bug.
