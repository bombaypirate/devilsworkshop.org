Almost a month ago I was supposed to visit rtCamp&#8217;s office for a interview with Rahul Bansal. The profile I was applying for was Blog Editor. Honestly I had no idea what a Blog Editor is and I decided to look up some details and Googled &#8216;Blog Editor&#8217;. It gave up a whole lot of a search results which covered links on how to edit blogs but nothing about a Blog Editor <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So I wised-up and then the next query was &#8220;Blog Editor Jobs India&#8221;. And voila I still was stuck. Now it¬† was a interesting situation to be caught in. The only company hiring a Blog Editor in India seemed to be rtCamp. Now that I am the Blog Editor I can probably say I am the first &#8216;Blog Editor&#8217; as a professional in India. I don&#8217;t know if its wholly accurate but it surely gives me a high üòõ

### The First Week

*Rahul Bansal at his desk*

My first day with rtCamp was interesting. Rahul Bansal (aka Boss) took me through some of the rules on what is to be done and what is not to be done while editing at Devilsworkshop. With quite a few posts still pending reviews I had a lot of work and learning to do¬† straight away. I was made to sit in this room where all others were PHP developers and me having no knowledge of PHP their screens were full of things I had no idea about. I did feel quite illiterate at the moment so I kept quite and concentrated on Devilsworkshop&#8217;s Dashboard on my screen üòê

*Lunch-time at rtCamp*

The Developers were quite chilled out and we bonded well over the week sharing lunch in the afternoon and tea in the evenings. rtCamp is divided into two groups or so we like to think sometimes when we have a identity crises. The first one is the Editor (that&#8217;s me) and the guys in charge of Operations and HR (that&#8217;s Vivek and Ashish). The second group is Radhe, Santosh, Kapil and Pragati and Rahul (the Boss).

*From L to R: Rohit, Kapil, Pragati, Radhe, Rahul*

The first group likes to call the second group &#8216;Geeks&#8217; but we have found out they actually like that name so it&#8217;s no fun saying it too many times. Honestly all of us are &#8216;Geeks&#8217; in our own way and in our own right. The newest recruit Rohit is a web designer and he is still unsure which group of &#8216;Geeks&#8217; he can be classified under.

### TDIS &#8211; Thank Devil It&#8217;s Sunday!

I noticed that this was a feature which was discontinued over time. Now that I am here it surely will be a weekly feature, published on Sundays only. We choose Sunday, because its holiday for most people. So rather than brainstorming with another technical how-to guides, its better to indulge in lighter discussions.

Of course, if we get more articles for this series, we may consider increasing frequency of posts in this new section. So bring it on and contribute to the Thank Devil Its Sunday
