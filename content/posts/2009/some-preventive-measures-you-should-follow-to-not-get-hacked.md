  * <div align="justify">
      Do not visit unknown profiles, as they may contain virus and malicious elements.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      If possible avoid <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/saving-photos-from-others-orkut-albums/">saving pictures</a> from unknown Orkut profiles.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Never open multimedia scraps like music, videos, etc.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Also, do not forward such multimedia scraps as you too may help the hackers.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Just to increase your total friends count, do not add or accept unknown people as a friend.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      As the home page of Orkut says “Never click any links or use java scripts while logged in to Orkut, doesn’t matter what they claim to do”. Even I would request you to adhere to this statement of Orkut.
    </div>

If you keep in mind the above few things before logging into Orkut, I am sure, you will have a splendid Orkutting experience. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></ul>
