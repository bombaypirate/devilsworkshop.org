If you are using WordPress for blogging or development you are probably burning with desire to be present in New York City where <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/', 'WordCamp']);" >WordCamp</a> will be held on this weekend.

With over <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/speakers/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/speakers/', '50 speakers']);" >50 speakers</a> andÂ many more wordpress experts in attendance, I would surely love to be there, just enriching myself with ideas they will be sharing. But the fact is, there is no way I can arrange for the resources for being part of <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/', 'WordCamp in New York']);" >WordCamp in New York</a>. Even our developers at <a href="http://rtcamp.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/', 'rtCamp']);" >rtCamp</a> were doing a bit of day dreaming about hoping onto the next flight to New York.

Then I came across <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/11/12/i-wish-i-was-at-wordcamp/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/11/12/i-wish-i-was-at-wordcamp/', 'this post on weblogtoolscollection']);" >this post on weblogtoolscollection</a> which mentioned in a very tongue in cheek manner the website with name &#8211;Â <a href="http://iwishiwasatwordcamp.com/nyc-2009/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iwishiwasatwordcamp.com/nyc-2009/', 'I wish I was at Word Camp']);" >I wish I was at Word Camp</a> ðŸ˜›

### AboutÂ <a href="http://iwishiwasatwordcamp.com/nyc-2009/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iwishiwasatwordcamp.com/nyc-2009/', 'I Wish I was at Word Camp']);" >I Wish I was at Word Camp</a>&#8230;

<a href="http://iwishiwasatwordcamp.com/nyc-2009/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iwishiwasatwordcamp.com/nyc-2009/', 'I Wish I was at Word Camp']);" >I Wish I was at Word Camp</a> is a amazing website to keep in touch with what is happening at Word Camp New York. It comes with the tag line *&#8216;Couldn&#8217;t cough up the money, huh?&#8217; *which shows a humorous side to the fact that even if you are in New York and not 10,000 miles away, the entry fee for a Sunday afternoon is **$25** and if you want to attend the whole weekend and share your knowledge on WordPress it can go up to as high as **$500**.

It has design like <a href="http://popurls.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://popurls.com/', 'PopUrls']);" >PopUrls</a> ([read review][1]) and purpose to.

From one page you can check twitter accounts ofÂ few top WordPress developers as well as can keep an eye on WordCamp NYC 2009&#8217;s twitter hashtag &#8211; #wcnyc

The website also includes pictures of participants posted through Flickr.

It seems like the folks at Word Camp are already started to enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
