Sounds way too good to be true! I thought a $99 netbook might push the demand up, but a 99-cent netbook really sounds crazy. This week, Sprint is subsidizing Compaq’s 1040DX netbook by offering it for just $0.99 when you sign up for 2 years with them. You could also get the same netbook for $199.99 with 2-year activation with Verizon or AT&T, or without a contract for $389.99.

## Limitations

  * Requires monthly access charge at $ 60. Activation and termination fees will apply.
  * The month plan only gives you 5GB of usage a month. If usage limit is exceeded, you will be charged a usage fee. (Please check with Carrier for more details.)

If you look at it, by subsidizing the hardware price, Sprint is gaining a two-year service agreement from the customer. The 99-cent offer comes at $60 per month, which means 3G service costs the consumer $720 per year or $1,440 for the life of the contract, and Sprint, over two years, gains approximately thousand dollars from one customer alone. Neat!

Let’s hope we get to see more carriers and more netbook options in the future as well.
