Can you imagine life without google talk, picassa or gmail notifier? In these times, a one minute outrage of google services results in panic all over the internet. People across the globe, rely on the google services for their day to day internet activities. Google has provided us with many useful utilities. But all these utilities work from a single encrypted system on your local computer so that you don&#8217;t have to enter your username and password everytime you login to any of the following services:

  * Google Talk
  * Google Picassa
  * Google Desktop Seach
  * Gmail Notifier
  * Internet Explorer (all versions from 4 to 8)
  * Google Chrome

But, imagine the case, if you forget the password of your main account. All these services will be locked out and your life would definitely be miserable. To make you safe and happy, there is an application which recovers all your locally stored google account passwords for these services. The application is called GooglePasswordDecryptor, and can be downloaded from <a href="http://securityxploded.com/getfile.php?id=1111" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://securityxploded.com/getfile.php?id=1111', 'here']);" >here</a>

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>How it works</strong></span>:

GooglePasswordDecryptor works on the principle that all the google services use a central encrypted database on your computer to fetch your username and password everytime you sign in to these services. Now, it uses different techniques to decrypt these stored passwords to plain text and present them before you in a window

Following is a screenshot of GooglePasswordDecryptor in action:
