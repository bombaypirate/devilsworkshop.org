> **Said Edward Hunter, comScore director of gaming solutions:**
> 
> “Online gaming continues to be one of the top gaining categories over the past year growing at ten times the rate of the total U.S. Internet population and reaching nearly one out of every two Internet users. And the growth in the category is occurring not only at the top gaming destination sites, but also through viral distribution platforms, including widgets and applications. In fact, some online gaming companies that distributed their games across sites are reaching as many people as the top online gaming sites.”

With the growing popularity of these gaming sites, there is an opportunity for advertisers and marketers to make the most of it and reach out to the desired  audience.
