Google has now added some new options to their search engine. Once you enter a search, there is a link right at the top of all the search results which is **&#8216;Show o****ptions**&#8216;. Click on that link and the list of options emerge to the left as shown in image below.

### Blogs and Reviews.

  * Once done with the list of search list there is an link to filter the search results with **Blogs**. That will show results which are related to blogs. Check the image below and see how on clicking blogs it shows all cricket related blogs.

  * Similarly if you click on **Review** it will bring up a list of reviews of cricket plans for mobile phones and also a few reviews of some cricket based video games.

### Shopping: More and Less

  * Google is fantastic to look up details for something you want to buy online. But sometimes you want to look up sites which only has related information and not necessarily a site from where you can make a purchase.
  * Click on **More Shopping Sites** or **Fewer Shopping Sites **and toggle the results. As it shows in the image below the moment I clicked on **More Shopping Sites **it showed search results from where I can buy cricketing gear online. I have highlighted the result.
