While updating my status message of Facebook from twitter, I got an error message which says &#8220;Some content in this message has been reported as abusive by Facebook users.&#8221; This error message was generated due to the use of <a href="http://www.retwt.me" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.retwt.me', 'retwt.me']);" target="_self">retwt.me</a>, the official URL shortener of <a href="http://www.tweetmeme.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tweetmeme.com', 'tweetmeme']);" target="_self">tweetmeme</a>.

In most of the cases you won&#8217;t be able to just update your status. However you may also have to face a security check-up just because of the use of this link. In that case you will get a mail from Facebook,

> We have detected suspicious activity on your Facebook account and have temporarily suspended your account as a security precaution. It is possible that malicious software was downloaded to your computer or that your password was stolen by a phishing website designed to look like Facebook.
> 
> You can regain control of your account by logging into Facebook and following the on-screen instructions.

I tried this thing from 2 more profiles too and both got the same error message. That means from now, Facebook may not allow you to use retwt.me in your status updates of anywhere on Facebook. However you can post the same original link shortened by using any other URL shortener like <a href="http://bit.ly" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly', 'bit.ly']);" target="_self">bit.ly</a> or <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tinyurl.com', 'tinyurl']);" target="_self">tinyurl</a>.

Well this is not at all a good news for <a href="http://www.tweetmeme.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tweetmeme.com/', 'tweetmeme']);" target="_self">tweetmeme</a> which is gaining popularity these days due to their tweetmeme button. I think that&#8217;s the reason why tweetmeme has started using other URL shorteners too.
