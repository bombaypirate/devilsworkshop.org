  Google recently launched a video campaign to market its web browser - Google Chrome (a browsing browser… a new way to get online!). The video is a collection of 11 short films (mostly animated) that tell us what Chrome is all about. 
  
  The short films creatively demonstrate Chome’s capabilities in the simplest way possible, so that even a non-techie could understand.

The short films creatively demonstrate Chrome’s capabilities in the simplest way possible, so that even a non-techie could understand.

**Christoph Niemann (the artist and illustrator of the video) said:**

> “*Instead of thinking of what I wanted to show, I tried to think about what I did NOT want to show. I realized that when I use a computer or browse the web these days, the one thing I do NOT think about is&#8230; a computer…*
> 
> …I *wanted to find a simple metaphor that explains what a browser does, without showing a screen, a keyboard, the letters WWW, pixels, zeroes or ones.”*
