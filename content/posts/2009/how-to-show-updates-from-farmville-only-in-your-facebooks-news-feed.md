This post is for all the FarmVille addicts on Facebook (like me ðŸ˜› ) who likes FarmVille more than anything else on Facebook. So obviously for them FarmVille updates from friends are more important. Also FarmVille updates helps a lot to grow faster in XP level and coins by adopting animals, fertilizing crops, getting bonus and receiving a special present.

To show FarmVille updates,

  1. Go to your Facebook&#8217;s homepage.
  2. Now on the left of &#8216;News Feed&#8217; there will be some links like &#8216;Status Updates&#8217;, &#8216;Photos&#8217;, &#8216;Links&#8217; e.t.c. At the bottom of these link find &#8216;more&#8217; option and click on that.
  3. This &#8216;more&#8217; link button shows the most used/recently used applications, obviously FarmVille will be there. If it&#8217;s not open FarmVille and return to homepage and try again.
  4. Once you find the &#8216;FarmVille&#8217; button click on that and your &#8216;News Feed will show updates only from FarmVille.

**You can earn coin bonus and gifts **from these updates. For that either adopt an animal, Fertilize your friend&#8217;s crop, or get a bonus from your friends.To do so, click on the links given with each FarmVille update.
