<a href="http://vizerra.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vizerra.com/', 'Vizerra']);" target="_blank"><strong>Vizerra</strong></a> is the first world&#8217;s first 3D educational portal which enable its users to travel to different historic locations Old Town Square, Macchu Picchu and Angkor Vat directly from your computer. This software is useful for those lazy guys and girls who are curious but do not want to spend their money on traveling to particular destination. Besides offering high quality 3D copies of these sites, it also provides audio guides with detailed description made by reputable publishers and museums. Each model comes with a comprehensive description (just like Wikipedia) that provides users more information such as the history, culture and many more.
