  <a href="http://www.blog.co.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blog.co.in', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-52263" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/blogcoin.png" border="0" alt="blog.co.in" width="250" height="92" align="right" /></a> Yesterday I saw a Google ad on <a href="http://www.devilsworkshop.org" target="_self">Devilsworkshop</a> about <a href="http://blog.co.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.co.in', 'Blog.Co.In']);" >Blog.Co.In</a>. I found that the user interface of <a href="http://www.blog.co.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blog.co.in', 'Blog.Co.In']);" target="_blank">Blog.Co.In</a> just like Blogger or WordPress but since it&#8217;s powered by wordpress, we can call it as the Indian version of wordpress. ðŸ˜‰ While the dashboard is just like the wordpress itself, the major difference is that you can write your blog in English as well as Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Bengali & Gujarati.

  But that is not all, there are several other reasons that make bloggers switch/ start their blog with <a href="http://www.blog.co.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blog.co.in', 'blog.co.in']);" >blog.co.in</a>. It is their bonus program in which they assure to pay you bonus money by adding their own adsense ads. But your blog should qualify for their bonus program.

  The minimum amount is Rs 1500/- and the upper limits depends on your blog and is not fixed. So, if you are a blogger and you are planning to start your own blog and want a fixed monthly income, then you can choose to blog at Blog.Co.In rather than using any other blogging platform and using your own ads.
