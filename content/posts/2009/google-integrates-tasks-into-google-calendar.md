Google announced today, that they have integrated Tasks into [Google Calendar][2]. This task list integration was a heavily requested feature by its users, and Google made sure not to annoy any of them.

### How does this feature work?

  1. Log into a Google Calendar account.
  2. Click on “Tasks” list under the left-hand top links.
  3. This will open up the tasks sidebar (familiar to users of the Gmail Labs Tasks feature) with some Calendar-specific additions.

#### **If you wish to** **create a task with a due date in the Calendar: **

  * Click on an empty space in month view or the all-day section of week view
  * Select the “Task” option
  * It will automatically appear on your calendar.

#### If you wish to attach a due date to an existing task:

  * Click the right-arrow from within the task list
  * Click on the calendar icon

#### If you wish to modify a task’s due date:

  * Just drag the date to a different date, just as you would with a regular calendar event.

#### If you wish to mark a task completed from within Calendar:

  * Just click on the task’s checkbox.

#### If you wish to keep track of due dates before they arrive:

  * Use the new “Sort by due date” feature which is available in the “Actions menu” at the bottom of your task list.

Although this cannot be a replacement for high-powered to-do apps like <a href="http://rmilk.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rmilk.com', 'Remember the Milk']);" >Remember the Milk</a>, but for those who are just fine with simple text files, this basic calendar-integrated task seems alright.
