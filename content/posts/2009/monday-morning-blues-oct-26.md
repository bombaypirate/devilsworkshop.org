Last Monday I did not post in this section calledÂ **Monday Morning Blues** as Rahul had already announced the winner of the Blogger of the Month. Congratulations to Sauravjit for winning it two times in a row. It seems he will complete a hat-trick as he has a commanding lead. Come on guys give him some competition.

Let me first apologize to all the authors and readers as I was ill for the last 8-10 days and was not able to post as many articles as I would have liked and also was not able to approve many posts which were pending. But I think I have almost completed the backlog of pending posts.

I want to start a tradition with Monday Morning Blues articles where I want to revisit some of the posts on DW by our Guest Authors.
