  1. ## Avoid Keyword Stuffing:
    
    What is keyword stuffing exactly? Wikipedia states,*&#8216;Keyword stuffing occurs when a web page is loaded with keywords in the meta tags or in content.&#8217; *
    
    Inserting excessive keywords into your posts, in meta tags or in your template (with the font color matching the background color) will lead your site into a ban from Google.</li> 
    
      * ## Avoid Sponsored Posts
        
        The job of the search engine is to search and provide genuine content to the user, that will be useful to them. Sites like PayPerPost and SponseredReview pay bloggers, to blog about the products of their advertisers. In this case many of the reviews aren&#8217;t true and up to the mark.
        
        If Google was to show such a result, then the usefulness and productiveness of the search results is absent. Hence Google has to ban your site.</li> 
        
          * ## Avoid Paid Text Link Ads
            
            The basic concept in paid text link ads is as follows: An advertiser pays you for a campaign, wherein he nominates certain keywords on your blog posts, which will link back to his site.
            
            Although this is a great way to earn money, such linking may not be relevant to the keywords and may often contain spam contents.
