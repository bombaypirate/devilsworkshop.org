  If you are using spark "Sparky" - The Alexa Toolbar for Firefox then you might have noticed that the current traffic rank on Sparky for any website and the actual traffic rank of that website on Alexa.com is always different, mostly in the cases when the rank of that particular website is greater than thousand.
  
  For example the current rank of Devils Workshop is 17,430 according to Alexa toolbar 'Sparky' and it's actual rank is 17,299 (as on September 30th 2009).

If you are using spark &#8220;Sparky&#8221; &#8211; The Alexa Toolbar for Firefox then you might have noticed that the current traffic rank on Sparky for any website and the actual traffic rank of that website on <a href="http://www.alexa.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alexa.com', 'Alexa.com']);" >Alexa.com</a> is always different, mostly in the cases when the rank of that particular website is greater than thousand.

For example the current rank of Devils Workshop is 17,430 according to Alexa toolbar &#8216;Sparky&#8217; and it&#8217;s actual rank is 17,299 (as on September 30th 2009).

**Sparky:**

**Alexa:**

**<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15223" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/DW-alexa-actual-600x412.jpg" alt="DW alexa actual" width="600" height="412" />**

Well the reason behind this is the difference in updating time of both <a href="http://www.alexa.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alexa.com', 'alexa.com']);" >alexa.com</a> and Sparky. They usually update <a href="http://www.alexa.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alexa.com', 'alexa.com']);" >alexa.com</a> one day before the Alexa toolbar &#8216;Sparky&#8217; for any particular website. That means the current rank of alexa.com for any particular website is gonna be the future rank for Sparky for the same website. For example if <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.devilsworkshop.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.devilsworkshop.org', 'today&#8217;s Alexa rank ']);" target="_self">today&#8217;s Alexa rank </a>for Devils Workshop is 17,299 then tomorrow&#8217;s Sparky toolbar rank for Devils Workshop is going to be 17,299 and Alexa will show the latest updated rank for tomorrow. That&#8217;s quite simple isn&#8217;t it? ðŸ˜‰

**UPDATE:**<span style="text-decoration: line-through"> This bug has been fixed by alexa just within few after writing this post. Now both Sparky and Alexa gets updated simultaneously.</span>
