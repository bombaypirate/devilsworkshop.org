[<img class="wp-image-51232" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/01/advani-adsense-thumb.png" border="0" alt="advani_adsense" width="75" height="281" align="right" />][1] Recently the blogosphere was filled with stories about advertisement of political parties in Google Adsense. You must be aware that some eminent politicians even started blogging these days.

But blogging and getting advertised on adsense are not all those promotional works being carried out by political parties. Recently a twitter account was created named @lkadvani and there were rumors that, LK Advani personally reads all the tweets sent to him and many of his followers even say that, this twitter account is not created by LK Advani, rather some of his supporting group look after the account. Even Obama uses a twitter account &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/BarackObama" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/BarackObama', '@BarackObama']);" target="_blank">@BarackObama</a> so what I was wondering, is L K Advani getting inspiration from Barack Obama?

Advertising, Blogging & Tweeting are not the only ways in which Advani is campaigning, he is also using SMS and E-mail as a tool to attract more and more youths.

Looking this promotions by politicians in India, specially by LK Advani, all I can say is they are following footsteps of Barak Obama. What do you think?

**Update: It seems some one created a fake twitter profile in the name of L K Advani. You can view its Google Cached Page <a href="http://72.14.235.132/search?q=cache:UBCOvGC__eIJ:twitter.com/lkadvani+site:+twitter.com/lkadvani&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=in&client=firefox-a" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://72.14.235.132/search?q=cache:UBCOvGC__eIJ:twitter.com/lkadvani+site:+twitter.com/lkadvani&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=in&client=firefox-a', 'here']);" >here</a>.**
