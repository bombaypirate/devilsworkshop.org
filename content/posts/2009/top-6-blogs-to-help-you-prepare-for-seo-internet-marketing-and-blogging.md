Your blog is a place to have fun, write malicious points and via these works, you make money. We all want money for our expenses but without proper preparation, you won&#8217;t get as much as you&#8217;d like.

As a blogger, I know it&#8217;s really difficult to know what others think, how they work and why they are better. You can write each and every thing perfectly well, but sometimes your content will not work prefect with search engine. Why is that?

A new blogger has so many questions in mind that go unanswered.

Today, I am going to share some blogs with you that can help you in preparing yourself for blogging, marketing and search engine optimization. You can get the answers to many of your questions while you read these blogs.
