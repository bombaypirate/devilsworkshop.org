Flock keeps you connected seamlessly with your main social networking, blogging, photosharing websites on the go!

## The list of websites integrated in Flock:

## **People**

  * Digg
  * Facebook
  * Flickr
  * Myspace
  * Twitter
  * Youtube

## **Media Sharing**

  * Photobucket
  * Picasa
  * Tinypic

## **Blogging  
**

  * Blogger
  * Blogsome
  * LiveJournal
  * Typepad
  * WordPress.com
  * Xanga
  * *Self Hosted Blog ***

## **Online Favorites**

  * Delicious
  * Magnolia**  
    **

## **Webmail**

  * AOL mail
  * Gmail
  * Yahoo! Mail** ******

In webmails, Flock keeps checkin&#8217; your email account(with the time interval as you set) and notifies you when there is a new mail for you. The case is same for &#8216;Tweets&#8217; in Twitter. For your WordPress, you can directly write a blog post from your browser. Flock, as already said, supports self-hosted blogs like Devils Workshop so that makes it even better.

So, BE A FLOCK STAR!

The best thing about Flock is that it is based on Mozilla 3.0 and supports all the extensions and themes that Firefox supports(with some exceptions).

It means that Flock= Firefox + Unlimited social networking!!
