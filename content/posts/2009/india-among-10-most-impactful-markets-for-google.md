Search engine giant Google is beginning to see India as one of the 10 most impactful markets in the coming 3-5 years. This means that soon they will start hiring locally to drive their brand advertising stream of business.

India is one of the largest employers for Google outside the US. Google has announced global job cuts ([close to 200 jobs in sales and marketing operations worldwide][1]), however, that has a minimal impact on India. Google believes that India is a strategic location with good technical skills and manpower. Moreover, it is among the highest growth markets for Google.

Estimated India revenue and headcount is yet to be disclosed by Google.

Whatever it may be, it sure is good news for India.
