A picture&#8217;s worth a thousand words. And it gets better when you have more than a thousand to choose from! With Gmail’s new Extra Emoji Icons, you can add more than 1000 emoticons in your emails.

*Good news* &#8211; Now you get a chance to express better without words.

*Bad news* &#8211; Now you spend ages wondering which emoticon to use when and where!

All these extra emoticons come from the so called “secret underground labs” of some top Japanese mobile carriers. Of course, Gmail has taken the permission to use them.

The icons are divided into **13 different categories**, the first two being the standard ones from Gmail. Some of the new stuff includes animals, various road signs, national flags, and animated icons.

</p>

### Enable your extra Emoji icons:

Just follow the simple steps below:

  1. Login to your Gmail account
  2. Go to the ‘Labs’ tab under Settings
  3. Scroll down to the ‘Extra Emoji’ option
  4. Check the ‘Enable’ box
  5. Hit ‘Save Changes’ button

Bingo! You got it…
