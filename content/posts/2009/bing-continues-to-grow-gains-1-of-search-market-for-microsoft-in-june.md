Although it is still behind [Yahoo search][1], but Bing has increased Microsoft’s share of search market by 1% in the US as per the analysis done by <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/press/bing-gains-1-perc-of-search-market-for-microsoft/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/press/bing-gains-1-perc-of-search-market-for-microsoft/', 'StatCounter']);" >StatCounter</a> in June.
