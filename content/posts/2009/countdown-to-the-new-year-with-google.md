Google has a interesting new way to ring in the new year. They have introduced a count down on their search engine.

I know you might not see the counter at the moment when you visit **<a href="http://google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com', 'Google.com']);" >Google.com</a>** but just click on &#8216;**I&#8217;mÂ Feeling Lucky**&#8216; without anything in the search bar and a counter appears which is counting down the seconds rightÂ up toÂ the New Year. ðŸ˜‰

So go ahead try this new innovative way **Google** has decided to countdown to the new year. ðŸ˜‰

If you know of any other tricks websites are pulling to ring in the **N****ew Year **let me know through your comments.
