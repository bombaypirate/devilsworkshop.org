Back in March this year, Google had launched a new version of mobile YouTube application for most Window Mobile and Symbian Series 60 devices. This mobile YouTube application enabled:

  * A **quicker access **to** **application start-up, searching, and video loading
  * **Sharper videos** and clearer sound than ever
  * **Better streaming over WiFi** to support a wider range of networks
  * A **robust buffering** so that videos could play even in weak coverage areas.
  * **Easy video viewing** once installed.

This application, however, was only available in US English. Overcoming this, Google today has introduced other languages to this as well, encouraging more YouTube users from across the globe to use this application with more convenience.

### Languages other than US English:

  * French
  * UK English
  * Italian
  * Spanish
  * German
  * Dutch

So now more people can watch their favorite videos with a familiar interface around them on their mobile phones!

You could download the app from http://m.youtube.com from your device.
