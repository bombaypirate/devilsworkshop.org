If you own a website you might have shared you own issues with having your website down. For a blogger this can also mean precious loss of traffic and subsequently a loss of revenue. <a href="http://www.wasitup.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wasitup.com', 'Wasitup.com']);" >Wasitup.com</a> is one such website that monitors your website and sends you an email if it goes down.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17768" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Was it up? Email Notification" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/wasitup2.png" alt="Was it up? Email Notification" width="547" height="293" />

### Features

  * <a href="http://www.wasitup.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wasitup.com', 'Wasitup.com']);" >Wasitup.com</a> conducts a HTTP HEAD request and checks if the statud code is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes', '200 OK']);" >200 OK</a>. This means it checks if the page you have submitted is up and running.
  * If you specify a text within the url, it checks if the text is present or not in the HTTP body.
  * Once your website is down you receive an email. Your website is checked every 5 minutes. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * You can monitor upto 10 websites per account.

I think this would be quite useful for someone who is working part time as a blogger or might be away on vacation for a few days. Obviously at such times a email notification of the downtime would be greatly beneficial.

Let me know what do you think about <a href="http://www.wasitup.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wasitup.com', 'Wasitup.com']);" >Wasitup.com</a> through your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
