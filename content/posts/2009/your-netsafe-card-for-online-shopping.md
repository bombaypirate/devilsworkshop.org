Many of us have a fear of fraud while using our Credit/Debit Card for online shopping &#8211; it may be stored at the merchant website or it may be charged extra, etc.

Most of the merchant sites are still not accepting Debit Cards. You can&#8217;t think about online shopping if you are not having any Credit Card and your friend is not interested in giving his/her Credit Card number ðŸ˜‰

Students can&#8217;t own a Credit Card, as they are not eligible to have it, then what shouldÂ  they do for purchasing a domain, for web hosting or buying gadgets at e-bay.

Virtual Credit Cards play a great role in this scenario, as using them is easy and they are safe and secure. Most of the banks are now providing such kind of services. I am using the HDFC NetSafe Card for two years. It is very convenient and safe and till now I didn&#8217;t have any problem with it. So I would like to share it with Devils Workshop.

### ****What is a Netsafe Card?****

NetSafe is a unique kind of Virtual Credit Card service by HDFC Bank, that offers complete security while shopping on the online merchant sites,Â **without revealing your actual HDFC Bank Credit/Debit Card details**. Â You can decide the NetSafe Card limit according to your useage, and it can be used one time only at one merchant site.

### ****How Does It Work?****

This service is free. The only thing is that you should have an HDFC Credit/Debit Card for it.You can get a Debit Card simply by opening a regular savings account with the HDFC Bank, then register your Credit/Debit Card for NetSafe service on the HDFC Bank website.

You can then generate a NetSafe card and use it for **online shopping only**. The limit of the card is the amount set by you. The purchase will appear in your statement just like any other transaction. NetSafe card is valid for maximum 48 hours and after which the unutilized amount will be credited back to your Credit/Debit Card account. If you don&#8217;t want to use the card, you can cancel it, and the amount will be credited back to you.

HDFC Bank has a very good Video Demo about NetSafe card: <a href="http://www.hdfcbank.com/common/onlineservices/netsafedemo/netsafe.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hdfcbank.com/common/onlineservices/netsafedemo/netsafe.html', 'Netsafe Demo']);" target="_blank">Netsafe Demo</a>
