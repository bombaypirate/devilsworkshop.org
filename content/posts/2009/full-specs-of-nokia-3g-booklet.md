When it has to offer Intel Atom Processor, Windows 7, 3G, GPS, 12 Hour Battery Backup at lower side of your budget, That too when it comes to be most trusted and largest mobile manufacturer of World.

Introduction of such kind of Laptops, would broaden the definition and application of Laptop to Next Level.  Intel Centrino has increased the Mobility of Laptops considerably and Intel Atom has led to Introduction of Small Screen Laptops at affordable prices.
