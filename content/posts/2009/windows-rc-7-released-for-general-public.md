This not being the final tested version, there are some risks involved in using it. According to Microsoft, people who wish to use this version should have some specific skills.

### Users should know how to:

  1. Troubleshoot problems
  2. Burn an ISO image to create a DVD
  3. Install Windows
  4. Back up and restore their PC
  5. Set up a network
  6. Create and use a system recovery disk.

Since Windows 7 RC is a work in progress, users may encounter technical difficulties. Hence, the users should not install the RC on their primary production machine.

### Some serious issues with Windows 7 RC:

There are some serious issues you might face while using Windows 7 RC. Some of these were also occurred with Windows Vista when it was first introduced, like:

  * Some software applications, including antivirus programs, might not install or work correctly
  * Printers and video cards, may not work
  * Access to corporate or home networks may go down
  * Users’ files may get corrupt

Plus, by March 1, 2010, the program will begin shutting itself down every two hours. So those who still have the Windows 7 RC running on their computers will probably want to uninstall it. According to Microsoft, people will have to rebuild their test PCs to replace the operating system with a non-expired version of Windows and reinstall the programs and data, according to Microsoft. Oh boy!!!

Right now, with the complexities of installing the program, I don’t think a non-techie user would quite be interested in “testing” the product. Not me at least!

## [**[UPDATE]**][2]

**On October 22, Microsoft will officially launch Windows 7.**

The upgrades are most likely to be free for people who buy a new Windows Vista PC shortly before Windows 7 arrives. However, we don&#8217;t yet know when this upgrade program begins or how much Windows 7 will cost.** [Keep reading&#8230;][2]
