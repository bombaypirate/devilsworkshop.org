We have seen many posts on the anti virus and people always give their opinion about there choice of the best anti virus. Though I have not seen anyone talking about method to check the effectiveness of your anti virus.

The best way to check the effectiveness is by getting some file from some infected PC into your system but the question is are you willing to take that risk? of course I will never take that risk.

Here is the simple code *( TEST string) *copy and paste it on a notepad file and save it. If your anti virus detect it as a virus or threat that will confirm you about the effectiveness of the anti virus.

**X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H***

This is how my antivirus detected the notepad file as virus.

<div class="mceTemp">
  <dl id="attachment_3566" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px;">
    <dt class="wp-caption-dt">
      <img class="size-medium wp-image-3566" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/01/antivirus-effectiveness-300x225.jpg" mce_src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/01/antivirus-effectiveness-300x225.jpg" alt="Antivirus test" width="300" height="225">
    </dt>
    
    <dd class="wp-caption-dd">
      Antivirus test
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

This is one of the best way to check the effectiveness of your anti virus as you don&#8217;t have to risk the security of your system.
