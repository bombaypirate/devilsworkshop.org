More than 2 years back when I started blogging, I used to blog mostly about Orkut and many used to consider [Devils Workshop][1] as an Orkut blog! There was a time when we had more than 90% content related to Orkut but as we started to cover more topics on Devils Workshop, Orkut users among our readers community started complaining.

To counter that problem, we temporarily introduced a dedicated Orkut feed there and also invited our readers to take a poll where we asked &#8211; ***Should we start a new portal for Orkut?***

Results are quite clear as you can see below! **69% **participants voted in favor of a dedicated Orkut blog! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-53841" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/01/polls-on-orkut-blog-at-devils-workshop.png" alt="polls-on-orkut-blog-at-devils-workshop" width="438" height="175" />

So here we are, introducing our third service for Orkut users- **Orkut Diary**&#8211; a dedicated blog for Orkut! The other two being â€“ <a href="http://www.orkutfeeds.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutfeeds.com/', 'Orkutfeeds']);" >Orkutfeeds</a> and <a href="http://www.orkutforum.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutforum.org/', 'OrkutForum']);" >OrkutForum</a>!

## For Subscribersâ€¦

### For RSS and Email Subscribersâ€¦

As I mentioned before, if you have subscribed to the dedicated feed for Orkut posts at Devils Workshop, you need not worry about anything as all subscribers will be migrated to Orkut Diaryâ€™s updates automatically.

Those who have subscribed to &#8216;all posts&#8217; feed at Devils Workshop need to subscribe to the [Orkut Diary feed][2] separately to receive updates from the Orkut Diary.

### For Google SMS Channel Subscribersâ€¦

If you are not aware about our SMS updates facility, please <a href="http://labs.google.co.in/smschannels/subscribe/OrkutBlog" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labs.google.co.in/smschannels/subscribe/OrkutBlog', 'click here to subscribe for free SMS updates']);" >click here to subscribe for free SMS updates</a>.

### Follow us on Twitterâ€¦

## About old Orkut content at Devils Workshopâ€¦

Now comes the main question, which many of our team members have asked â€“ *What about the Orkut related content at Devils Workshop???*

Technically, being a WordPress expert myself and with the help of our <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=859878416543270408" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=859878416543270408', 'Agent WordPress aka Mayur Somani']);" >Agent WordPress aka Mayur Somani</a>, we can do all the content migration, without affecting any SEO or traffic, at the most in one hour!

But most of our posts regarding Orkut contain information about hacks and bugs that already got rectified with time. Also, as Orkut is upgrading itself, many posts are becoming irrelevant with time. So we will look for only good and useful content and will post them here with improvements in the coming days!

## For DW co-authors and guest bloggersâ€¦

Like [Devils Workshop][3], Orkut Diary also follows the same revenue sharing model. There is no need for you tosignup or join Orkut Diary separately. Your Devils Workshop login as well as AdSense information will work here as it is! *Kool huhâ€¦ isnâ€™t it! ðŸ˜‰ *

Also, just for your info, your login details at Devils Workshop will work at the [Devils Workshop forum][4] and <a href="http://www.orkutforum.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutforum.org/', 'Orkut Forum']);" >Orkut Forum</a> as well. The same will be the case with all the future blogs that we will be launching in the coming days!

So what are you waiting for? Login and start posting! There will be a surprise in store for youâ€¦

He is still working on the theme for further improvements.

In the end, thank you everyone for being with us!
