Dimdim provides an easy, open, affordable collaboration. It is used for online meetings, eLearnings, desktop sharing, trainings, distance education, unified collaboration, webinars, free web meetings and more.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> I came to know about this great open source web conference application last year when I wasÂ  doing my Final Year Academic project on web conference solution using Flex and Flash Media Server. I have been watching this product since then. I really love their concept. Surely, this is going to change the way we meet over web.<br /> </span>

<span style="color: #000000">DimDim is great and the reason why I love it is because of its openness. This opens the door for others to experiment and build another great application on top of dimdim technology. Hats off to you guys!!!</span>
