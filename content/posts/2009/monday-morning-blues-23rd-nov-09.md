This week I am back with &#8216;**Monday Morning Blues**&#8216; series of posts. A lot of things have happened in the last 2 weeks and the major change at **Devils Workshop** is that our contest &#8216;**Blogger of the Month**&#8216; has now become &#8216;**[Blogger$ of the Month][1]**&#8216;.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17125" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/mon_morn_blues2311.png" alt="mon_morn_blues2311" width="337" height="307" />

### [Blogger$ of the Month][1]

We will have three winners instead of one. The one who is rated 1st will get $75, rated 2nd will get $50 and finally the guest author who is rated 3rd gets $25. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### [First Time Authors][2]

A lot of new writers who have started to contribute to DW often submit posts which are sometimes copied from other sources. **Devils Workshop** has a strict policy regarding its content. There is one simple rule and that rule is your content has to be **original**. There have been a couple of instances when someone has reproduced an article from a magazine. This is not something we allow either.

### [Adsense Account][2]

Some authors have many questions regarding **Adsense** account being configured for **DW**. We earn revenues from our Adsense account for which we use the DW&#8217;s URL. If you are creating an adsense account and for that you need to submit a URL then that URL has to be either your of your blog or even a friends blog. You cannot give **DW&#8217;s** URL as that will get rejected. We are now allowed to give DW&#8217;s URL to be shared with Adsense.
