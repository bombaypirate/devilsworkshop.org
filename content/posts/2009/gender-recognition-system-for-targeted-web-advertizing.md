## What does Gender Recognition System do?

A*Star (Singapore&#8217;s Agency for Science, Technology and Research) has developed a smart image recognition software that has the ability to detect frontal human faces on digital video stream quickly and reliably. This technology was displayed at CommunicAsia 2009, held at the Singapore Expo.

  * Based on the extracted face images, the engine is able to simultaneously detect the genders of multiple persons. It recognizes someone as either a guy or a girl when an image of a person is captured with a regular webcam.
  * In addition to that, it can return the statistic of the viewers such as the number of person looking at the screen.

For example:

It can be set up to deploy targeted advertisements &#8211; a beer ad for a guy walking past and a shoes ad for a girl strolling across.
