For me, Facebook is just like an apple iphone. Facebook hasn&#8217;t provided you with all the features by default but you can use as many applications as you require making it more user friendly. Just for example, I am going to explain here is a feature, which can be used to make polls on your Facebook profile that can be answered by anybody on Facebook.

You can use the application &#8220;<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/livingsocial/micro/polls/new?ref=nf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/livingsocial/micro/polls/new?ref=nf', 'Living Social']);" target="_blank">Living Social</a>&#8221; for this, which is simple and easy to use. Use <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/livingsocial/micro/polls/new?ref=nf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/livingsocial/micro/polls/new?ref=nf', 'this link']);" target="_blank">this link</a> to go to the application page.

**Creating a Poll:**

**Step 1: **Go to the application (click here) and choose a category. Use general if it&#8217;s not mentioned on the list. Click next to make possible answers for your question.

**Step 2: **Enter your question and select next.

**Step 3:** Now search for your answers and use them as options for your question. If not mentioned on the list by default then use &#8220;Don&#8217;t see what you want? Add your own!‚Äù Check out the screen shot below.

**Step 4:** Type your answer and select an image from your computer. Image for each option is compulsory. Use at least two options to complete your poll.

**Step 5: **Publish your question. Publishing your question will make the poll visible to all your friends. You may also invite some friends to take the quiz.

That&#8217;s it; now your question will be on your friend&#8217;s homepage.
