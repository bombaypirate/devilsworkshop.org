  Telephone costs are becoming cheap these days, thanks to the modern day technologies which rule the world. Though there are numerous VoIP services like Skype, Yahoo,Voxox, etc., many people still have a hang for the traditional telephone. Some of these may offer excellent services but old people may have some difficulty in using them.

      Magicjack consists of a Magicjack USB. This can be connected to any USB port in a computer having a broadband internet connection. The other end of the Magicjack can be connected to  any ordinary telephone using the standard telephone wire  (RJ 11, I guess&#8230;). Every Magicjack has an unique telephone number which can be personalized.

            <strong>The initial investment is around $40 and after that, the yearly  payment is $20. </strong>I think this is a worth investment as you get unlimited calls for a pretty cheap price. To get a hands on experience, I procured a Magicjack through one of my relatives and connected it to my comp. Initially, it takes a bit of time for downloading the Magicjack user interface. After that, I tried placing the call from here in India to my friend in the US. The voice clarity was amazing&#8230; far far far&#8230; better than what I expected,with a clean and simple user interface and I think this is a real good investment. It is a boon for all those people who want to keep in touch with their loved ones.
