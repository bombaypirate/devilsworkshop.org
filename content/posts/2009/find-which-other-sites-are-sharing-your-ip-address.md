excerpt: Hosting has gone dead cheap these days, which has encouraged more and more people to set-up a website. Why its so cheap that in some $20 you could set-up a fully running site with unlimited hosting and unlimited bandwidth (eg. Hostgator-$4.95+ Namecheap-$9.69) This has mainly happened due to the concept of shared hosting wherein many websites reside on one web server connected to the Internet. These websites also mostly share the same IP address. This is a trick to find sites that have the same IP Address as yours.

Why its so cheap that in some $20 you could set-up a fully running site with unlimited hosting and unlimited bandwidth (eg. Hostgator-$4.95+ Namecheap-$9.69) This has mainly happened due to the concept of shared hosting wherein many websites reside on one web server connected to the Internet. These websites also mostly share the same IP address. This is a trick to find sites that have the same IP Address as yours.

**SpyOnWeb** is a new service that lets a user to find which sites are hosted on the same IP address. Although the main purpose of this site is to find which sites are owned by the owner of a particular site.

For eg.Â  If you key-in http://www.devilsworkshop.org/ you get the following result:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12423" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/07/dw-1.jpg" alt="Screen-1" />

As you might have guessed it uses the adsense&#8217;s publisher ID and Google analytics ID to find other sites that the owner owns and I must say it is pretty accurate!

Anyways back to our main topic, finding other sites sharing your same IP address. Well if you scroll down you could see sites that are included below &#8216;IP address&#8217; heading. These are the sites that share your same IP address. A search for the http://www.devilsworkshop.org/ showed up like this:

## So, why would I want this for?

Well, sometimes there are cases that a site sharing your server has got marked for spam or adult content. You could also face the consequences of this. So with this tool you could come to know as to which site was responsible for it. Also, its just good to know you are sharing servers and IP&#8217;s with some of the other sites out there ðŸ˜› .
