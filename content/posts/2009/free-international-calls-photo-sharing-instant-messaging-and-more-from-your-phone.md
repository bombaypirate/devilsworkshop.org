Nimbuzz Mobile **free to download and use**. Nimbuzz will not charge or bill you for anything. However, since Nimbuzz uses your internet connection, incremental data charges from your provider will apply. It is, therefore strongly recommend to use the mobile client only with a flat-rate data plan or free Wifi connection.

## Save Money

Instead of calling minutes, Nimbuzz uses the internet to let you make free international calls to your buddies. You can also register your VoIP account to call your friends on landlines and mobile phones.

## Locate your Friends

Make yourself heard: If your buddies are offline, let them know you’re trying to get in touch by sending them a &#8220;Buzz&#8221;. It will start Nimbuzz Mobile on their mobile phone.

## Never lose your Contacts

## **B****iggest Drawbacks of Nimbuzz:**

You must be wondering, when Nimbuzz is so useful and cool and all that, why isn&#8217;t it present in every Java-enabled phone? Okay, Now the bad news, Nimbuzz does a lot of data transfer(that means that if you aren&#8217;t usin&#8217; some &#8216;Unlimited plan&#8217;, you&#8217;ll have to lighten your pocket much.

Now, the second negative point is the result of the first one, Because it transfers a lot of data, it consumes a lot of battery too(Well&#8230; I guess this is main the reason why it is not SO popular).
