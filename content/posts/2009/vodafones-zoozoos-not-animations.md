In a latest news from Hindustan Times, &#8216;Zoozoos&#8217; (as they are supposedly called!) are actually real people wearing white specially designed costumes. Just in case you are wondering what are these &#8216;Zoozoos&#8217;&#8230; these are the much loved white dwarf like characters seen in all the Vodafone ads these days (particularly during IPL breaks). One of the main challenge was to make the characters look and behave like cartoon / animated figures.

This was achieved using special material wrinkle free cloth which made the body suites look smooth (like in animation) and the ads were shot at slower than normal frame rate so that the movements look swift but funny. A keen observer might notice that the expressions on the face are also static and are changed only between the (shot) cuts.

So next time you see a Vodafone ad, pay extra attention to details to see if you can make out something with these things in mind ðŸ˜‰
