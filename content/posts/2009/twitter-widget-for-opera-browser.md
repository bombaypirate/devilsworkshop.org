The Opera browser is one of my favorite ones. I started using it many years ago and even though now I end up using Chrome and Firefox a lot more, I still do use Opera quite a bit. So it was nice to know about a **Twitter widget** which is available with Opera.

### Twitter Widget on Opera

  * If you want to install the widget you just need to visit the <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/14501/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://widgets.opera.com/widget/14501/', 'widgets page for Opera']);" >widgets page for Opera</a>.
  * Once on it you can download or install the Twitter widget. Do make sure **JScript** is enabled on Opera.
  * Sign into Twitter from the widget and you are good to go.
  * A great feature of the Twitter Widget was that even when I closed my Opera browser the widget still worked like a stand alone Â application. This works only if you are using the **Opera 10.2 version**.

**Is it any good?**

I found it not all that different from most of the desktop clients available for using **Twitter**. The widget seemed to be ideal for people who use Twitter moderately and end up sending a few tweets every day. It surely is not a worthy replacement of many popular Twitter applications like **TweetDeck** as it does not still support **Twitter Lists**. That is the main drawback of this widget as because it does not support Lists, following incoming tweets gets a little difficult.

This widget is still in testing and hence might have some bugs. But I did not have any issues for a couple of hours I used the widget. Download the **Opera** browser from their <a href="http://www.opera.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.opera.com/', 'website']);" >website</a> and the widget from <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/14501/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://widgets.opera.com/widget/14501/', 'here']);" >here</a>.
