But how often do you really shop your cloths online? Well, may be that is because you miss that personal touch when you would like to try out a particular outfit before buying it or ordering it online.

While shopping online, you might also not be very sure if the particular garment shown in the display of the site is really in vogue or not. ****

Well, these are some of the common concerns any online buyer worldwide would face… so and you are no different. Various online models have been worked around to overcome this problem- “pay it later” being one of them, where buyers pay for the garment only when they receive it.

<a href="http://www.openfashion.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.openfashion.com/', 'OpenFashion']);" >OpenFashion</a> is one service that comes very close to solving these concerns. What it actually does is add a bit of social networking element to the online garment shopping. This way they build over on word-of-mouth publicity by allowing the buyers to rate various clothes, as a result helping merchants winning their confidence.

## How does it work?

Openfashion allows its users to bookmark and tag their favorite clothes online. The users can create polls, so that the suppliers can learn from their opinions about various products. One of the most notable things about Openfashion is that it contains a number of status updates similar to Facebook and Twitter.

Open Social can be considered as a **social shopping fashion network** or community that connects consumers with the right products.
