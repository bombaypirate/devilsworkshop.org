If you are wondering that how you can extract audio track from a video file, then here is a way that you can use to get your videos to be converted to an audio format. We often find music tracks we like on YouTube. Many time we are just interested in audio part of such videos.

I used a freeware software for this purpose &#8211; **AoA Audio Extractor**. It is very easy and simple to use. You just need to add files, select them and click **Start** button. You can also play with advanced custom settings.

This will help you encode your video songs to audio and then you can also transfer them to your iPod, music player or mobile phone. Here is a hint to makeÂ  productive use of it.

Download videos from Youtube and get them converted into audio and transfer to your mobile and enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
