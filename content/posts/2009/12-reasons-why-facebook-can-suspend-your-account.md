Today I am going to tell you why Facebook can disable an account and trust me that it&#8217;s not a rare case when Facebook disables a profile or account, if you violate their any of the term or condition they will disable your account within a week. That&#8217;s the reason what makes Facebook clean and a social networking site with better privacy.

Below are the reasons why Facebook can suspend an account:

  1. **Nudity or Pornography: **This is the most common reason why a Facebook account** **gets suspend. If you use any such kind of picture or video anywhere in your profile or on Facebook, your account will be suspended without even a single report abuse.
  2. **Abusive Language: **If you use abusive language while writing anywhere on Facebook then they may suspend your account. This is generally when someone &#8220;Reports&#8221; your profile.
  3. **Fake Profile: **If you are using a name of a celebrity or any other person&#8217;s name rather than your own original name, they will suspend your account.
  4. **Threatening Someone:** Never ever use a Facebook profile for threatening anyone doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s just for fun. Facebook takes this thing very seriously and they will immediately ban you.
  5. **Hate Speech/Content:** Some people use their Facebook account to make a group/<a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/09/30/how-to-create-pages-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/09/30/how-to-create-pages-on-facebook/', 'page']);" target="_self">page</a> against any particular person or thing. Never do such kind of things and neither post anything anywhere on Facebook which is against any particular person.(<a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/09/29/facebook-should-obama-be-killed-poll-removed/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/09/29/facebook-should-obama-be-killed-poll-removed/', 'recent example is &#8216;Should obama be killed&#8217; poll']);" target="_self">recent example is &#8216;Should obama be killed&#8217; poll</a>)
  6. **Using profile for Spamming:** Not only Facebook but the whole internet hates this. Never ever use your Facebook profile to promote your product or website. However you can create a new <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2009/09/30/how-to-create-pages-on-facebook/" target="_self">page</a> for promotion.
  7. **Too many friend requests:** If you just love to add random people and keep adding other Facebook users then this could also be a reason for account suspension. Add less than 20 people per day.
  8. **Malware/Virus:** If your profile is sending virus/infection by any means to other Facebook users or their own servers that they will suspend your account immediately.
  9. **Too many groups: **Never join more than 200 groups a day. If you exceed this limit, they will suspend your account.
 10. **More than one profile:** If you are using more than one profile from the same name and information then one or both of your account will get suspended.
 11. **Too many messages:** If you post too many message on your friend&#8217;s wall or inbox, it will be considered as spamming.
 12. **Same message, different content:** If you want to post same message again and again then always make some changes in it else it will be considered as a spam.

So any one or more than one points could be answer to your question &#8220;Why Facebook disabled my account&#8221;. The points mentioned above are against their terms and conditions so try not to violate it.
