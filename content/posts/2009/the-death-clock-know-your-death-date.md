<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6054" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/04/title.gif" alt="The Death Clock" width="241" height="51" />Getting a glimpse into the future can be exciting, but not when it leads you into finding the number of seconds you have left to live! In spite of knowing that life isn&#8217;t endless, finding out your death-date can give a chill in your spine.

Go ahead&#8230; check for yourself&#8230; your death date on &#8211; <a href="http://www.deathclock.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.deathclock.com/', 'The Death Clock!']);" title="The Death Clock"  target="_self">The Death Clock!</a>

### How does this site work?

The site works on a simple formula. It would take your age and then subtract it from the average lifespan of a man or a woman. That number is then converted into seconds. No rocket science!

### How accurate is it, anyway?

You might come back arguing that there&#8217;s no big scientific logic behind these calculations. That&#8217;s right. There isn&#8217;t any.

Remember, this site is no God! It will only give you approximate numbers based on very simple and generic calculations. For instance, if you smoke, it would just take off a few million seconds from your life.

### Wish to delay your death date?

Although this site is mostly meant for fun, it does give out some accurate results like your BMI (body mass index), based on which you could chose to improve your lifestyle and eating habits. It&#8217;s common sense that if you lead a healthy life, your chances of living longer automatically increase.

By the way, as of today, I have **1,679 ,649, 706**&#8230; 705&#8230; 704&#8230; seconds left to live. How many more for you&#8230;?
