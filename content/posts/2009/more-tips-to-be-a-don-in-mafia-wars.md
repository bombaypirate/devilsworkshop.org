Here are few more tips which could help you to be a powerful Don in mafia Wars.
</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">
    <strong>Tip 1 : Make Use of the Bank</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    This is the best tip i got from playing the game for all these days. Before you leave your PC after playing the game, put all your cash into the bank. A 10% laundering fee will be taken by the bank, but if you put the cash there, it would be safe from all the threats. If you make use of the bank, you don&#8217;t need to fear about your defense skills because if all your money is out on the bank, the attackers can&#8217;t rob anything from you. So, there won&#8217;t be any loss, even if someone attacks you and you loss the fight.

    <strong>Tip 2 : Catch the Loots </strong>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center">
    Loot items are some items which you can&#8217;t buy with the money you have. These weapons can only be gained by doing jobs which have a loot icon near them (see the picture to see the loot icon). They are very rare weapons and can do better in fights and attacks.<br /> <img class="aligncenter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/loot.JPG" alt="Loot items on mafia wars" width="405" height="89" />

    <strong>Tip 3 : Attack is the Best defense</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center">
    Never give others a chance for an attack. When your energy becomes empty, before leaving your PC, try to take part in some Fights with other gangsters around you. You should buy and use all kind of latest weapons and must ice them till your screen shows an &#8216;Nothing Personal&#8230;&#8230;.&#8217; window <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/iced-600x239.jpg" alt="mafia" width="480" height="191" />
  </p>

    <strong>Tip 4 : Grow your Mafia</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Growing your mafia is very good to increase your strength. If you have some time, chat with others and include them in your mafia. I&#8217;m one of the players who doesn&#8217;t have much time to contact or invite others to my mafia and therefore I am suffering. So try to grow your mafia to be stronger.
  </p>

    <strong>Tip 5 : Buy Properties- They are the Golden Goose</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Buying properties cold really help you to increase your bank balance. I have told you this is a real time game, so as  everything else, this is also realistic. You can purchase various properties with the cash that you own. They can generate a lot of cash once you have bought it. I&#8217;m making most of my cash in this game, through the properties. If you have a 5 star hotel at a beach front property or a office building at the downtown, you can earn more without any blood shed.

    These are only some of the tips  found by playing this game. If you are also a player of this game, you can too add the tips that you found, here. Mention them in the comments and i&#8217;l add them to the post if they are appropriate <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
