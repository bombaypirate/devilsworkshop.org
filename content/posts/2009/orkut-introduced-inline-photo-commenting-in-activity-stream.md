[Activity stream or updates from friends][1] on your Orkut homepage shows among other things photo related updates from your friend.

Earlier, if somebody post a comment on your friend&#8217;s you need to go to that photo to reply to it. This is made simple by Orkut&#8217;s new inline photo comments feature as highlighted in screenshots below.

<img class="alignnone size-large " style="border: 1px solid black" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/orkut-inline-photo-comments-2-450x138.png" alt="orkut-inline-photo-comments-2" width="450" height="138" />

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-133" style="border: 1px solid black" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/orkut-inline-photo-comments-1-450x176.png" alt="orkut-inline-photo-comments-1" width="450" height="176" />

Now you can reply to those comments right from your Orkut&#8217;s homepage, making conversations more interesting!

Still, if you want to comment on a friend&#8217;s photo you see in your activity stream, you need to click on it and then only you can comment on there photo.

If this seems confusing there is a little difference between these two types of updates related to photo. Friends comment on photo **shows comment itself along with photo** while photo-upload updates **shows photos uploaded by your friends**.

Lets hope Orkut will add inline commenting on **uploaded photos** as well in near feature. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Like most Orkut features, this may take some time before it get activated on your account. So don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t see &#8220;add comment&#8221; option on your Orkut homepage.
