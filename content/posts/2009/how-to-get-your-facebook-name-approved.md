    We know that it&#8217;s very difficult to change your display name on Facebook and it&#8217;s not possible to choose any name that you would like to make your display name. The reason behind this strict name policy is to reduce the number of fake profile of popular people, though it&#8217;s less effective and more annoying because sometimes it don&#8217;t allow us to use our name. This is the case when you are having a common name. For example in Christians the name Jack, Bill e.t.c are so common any many people on Facebook use such kind of names.

      Mostly they approve a name immediately or within an hour, but if you have requested a completely new name it will take 24 hours to review it by Facebook. So be patient and don&#8217;t change your name again and again.
