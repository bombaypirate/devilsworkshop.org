Here’s a quick update for all Facebook users. Facebook has shut down its RSS NewsFeed application.

They had recently launched a new application that converted their News feed into RSS feed that could be subscribed to and accessed outside of Facebook.

But apparently, it violated Facebook&#8217;s privacy controls, and now it’s gone.

I think in a way it’s good to know that Facebook is concerned about the user’s privacy. Letting out your friends content and updates to a public place is not the best thing to do.

Read Write Web however believes that this Facebook feature was very useful and shouldn&#8217;t have been removed. <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/five_things_you_can_do_with_this_new_facebook_rss.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/five_things_you_can_do_with_this_new_facebook_rss.php', 'Click here to know how and why.']);" >Click here to know how and why.</a>

Facebook is yet to respond back with an official statement. We will have to wait for a little longer to get more details on this subject.
