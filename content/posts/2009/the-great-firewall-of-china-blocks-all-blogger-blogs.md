### What is the Tiananmen Square incident of 1989?

Around 4000 to 6000 civilians (unconfirmed) were shot dead by the Chinese army during a bloody military operation on 4<sup>th</sup> June 1989 to crush a democratic protest in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.

### News & articles related to the incident in China banned!

  * The news media is forbidden to report anything related to the protests
  * Websites related to the protest are blocked on the mainland
  * A search for Tiananmen Square protest information on the Internet in Mainland China largely returns no results
  * In 2006, Google agreed to censor their China site- Google.cn, to remove information about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre
  * Wikipedia was blocked as it had uncensored articles on the 1989 protests. The ban on Wikipedia in China was lifted recently, but the link to this incident in Chinese Wikipedia remains dead.

### How to find if your blog is accessible from China?

  1. Go to <a href="http://www.websitepulse.com/help/testtools.china-test.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.websitepulse.com/help/testtools.china-test.html', 'WebSitePulse’s China test tool']);" >WebSitePulse’s China test tool</a>
  2. Enter the URL of your blog
  3. See the result

### How to read your favorite blog from China?

Here is workaround, which should work:

*(Can someone from China test its authenticity?)*

  1. Open the home page of Newsgator Online, Bloglines or Google Reader
  2. Subscribe to the blogger blog RSS by typing xxx.blogspot.com/rss.xml or xxx.blogspot.com/atom.xml in the URL field
  3. You shall be able to see the content as they are served from the cache of web readers and not from Blogger&#8217;s server

### How to ensure that readers from China can read *blogspot.com* without trouble?

  1. Get a static numeric IP address for your blogger’s blog hostname
  2. Broadcast the IP address to your subscribers in an email or through rss feed

As ISPs generally block sites by name but not by IP address, this should work.
