When designing a website or a blog, you might need to show some feeds from another website. This is quite relevant if you have two blogs and want to show feeds from one to the other.

**Feed Sweep** is a website which allows the user to register and create customized widgets for showing feeds from other websites. It creates a code of the customized widget which you can insert into your homepage for the feeds to show up.

### About <a href="http://feedsweep.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://feedsweep.com', 'Feed Sweep']);" >Feed Sweep</a>

  * **Feed Sweep** has various  plans and most of them are paid. The free plan comes with some advertisements. I was curious to know if these advertisements would be intrusive but was surprised pleasantly that they were text based and pretty similar to Google Ads.
  * In the **Free plan** I could add upto 5 feeds to show up. I could customize the format and color of the widget. Once done with it, I got to see an example of how the widget would look along with the **HTML** code which I had to enter in my website (see image below).
  * The customizing part is pretty good. It includes defining the width in pixels of the Feed. It also allows you to choose the number of feeds that will be posted on the widget. A customizable title is also allowed. When you get the code it is in **JavaScript**.
