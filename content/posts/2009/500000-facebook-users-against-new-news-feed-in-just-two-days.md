That&#8217;s why many Facebook users are protesting against it and the word &#8216;many&#8217; here represents  500,000 Facebook users who just joined the group <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=172544548680" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=172544548680', 'PLEASE GIVE US OUR OLD NEWS FEED BACK!']);" target="_blank"><strong>PLEASE GIVE US OUR OLD NEWS FEED BACK!</strong></a> within two days and this group is still expanding. Earlier it was the Facebook&#8217;s new theme which wasn&#8217;t liked by the users.

### Why people hates new Facebook &#8216;News Feed&#8217;?

People are tweeting, updating facebook statuses, joining groups, making pages against the neww feed&#8230;.But the thing comes here is why people hate this new &#8216;News Feed&#8217;. We have few answers:

  1. The confusing News Feed and Live Feed, users are still not getting what it is and this new feature makes Facebook even more confusing. (Solution: <a title="Link to Refreshed news feed look: New Facebook Homepage" rel="bookmark" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2009/10/24/refreshed-news-feed-look-new-facebook-homepage/">what is the difference between news feed and live feed in facebook</a>)
  2. Live feed is not that much live, people are still getting older updates on their &#8216;Live Feed&#8217; which makes it uninteresting.
  3. Flooded &#8216;Live Feed&#8217;, as &#8216;Live Feed&#8217; is now showing even a single update of your friends, it seems like someone is spamming the Facebook&#8217;s feed using an automated computer.
  4. Dull &#8216;News Feed&#8217;, the other option rather &#8216;Live Feed&#8217; is your &#8216;News Feed&#8217; which is quite boring now as it shows only that updates which were liked or commented by somebody else. That&#8217;s why it got hardly updated and we see only 2-3 average new posts per hour.
  5. Facebook is still not 100% up, as facebook was under maintenance for most of the users and for some it&#8217;s still under maintenance, people aren&#8217;t able to see the new &#8216;News Feed&#8217; properly.

So what do you think about the new news feed????
