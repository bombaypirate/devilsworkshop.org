### Using G.ho.st VC alongside Windows?

At home, you can use:

  * **G.ho.st file upload / download facility **to keep your most important documents, music and photos on G.ho.st and access them from other places.
  * **G.ho.st My Items **to manage your Web stuff like links to Flickr, Google Docs, YouTube videos, etc. since Windows doesn&#8217;t do that well.  
    ****

### Using G.ho.st VC instead of Windows?
