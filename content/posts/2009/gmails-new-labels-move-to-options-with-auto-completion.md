As a Gmail user, you must have noticed some new changes to Gmail interface recently. Here is our analysis on these changes. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">At the end you will find workaround for now missing <strong><em>&#8220;Search The Web&#8221; </em></strong>button from Gmail interface.</span>

### 1. Assigning Labels is easier now

As highlighted in below screenshot, you can now search, create and assign multiple labels easily. Moreover, while searching you can enjoy auto-completion now.

### [<img class="wp-image-53552" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/gmailnewlabelsfeature-thumb.png" border="0" alt="Gmail New Labels Feature" width="546" height="249" />][1]

[You may also want to use colored-labels feature of Gmail][2]. You can also [use labels to auto-filter emails][3] as per your preference.

### 2. Moving emails also become easier…

Those who are new to Gmail or its labeling concept, sometimes wonder where are folders in Gmail. You can think of labels as special folder. You can move emails to these labels easily now.

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/gmailmovetofeature-thumb.png" border="0" alt="Gmail Move To Feature" width="444" height="414" />][4]

***Move to ***and ***Labels*** may seem similar but there is a difference. If you assign labels, conversation still remains in the inbox but when you *move *it, it gets archived automatically.

### 3. Better “More Actions” menu

***[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/gmailmoreactions1-thumb.png" border="0" alt="Gmail More Actions-1" width="133" height="116" align="right" />][5] More actions ***menu group together some less frequently used actions and places them in separate menu. Also its position is less obstructive.

Only thing could be done better is adding **“[Create a document][6]” **option into more actions menu. If enabled, **“Create a document” **option show up on extreme right side which go unnoticed because of ads.

### 4. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Missing</span> Search the web button

<span style="text-decoration: line-through">Gmail used to have <strong>&#8220;Search The Web&#8221;</strong> button which is now removed in this new interface. Our reader <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/10-best-firefox-shortcuts-you-must-know/">Vish</a> is disappointed as…</span>

> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">this <em>(&#8220;Search The Web&#8221; button)</em> helped us not to open a browser window and type www.google.com. for the search. It also gave the luxury or not going for CTRL+T/ CTRL+N for opening a new window</span>

**Update:** Gmail brought &#8220;Search the web&#8221; button back now. *(05 March, 2009)*

Personally I never used that button but those who were using it can now, use CTRL+K (only Firefox) to directly switch focus to browser&#8217;s search box. You don’t need to open any window/tab, neither do you need to use mouse!

Above shortcut is for Firefox only. Figure out similar shortcut for your browser. You can also check [top 10 Firefox shortcuts][7].
