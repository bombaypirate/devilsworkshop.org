excerpt: "Bing, as we know, is slowly increasing their user base. Whether the reason is its novelty or usefulness is a different debate altogether. But one of the interesting features in Bing is the background image that appears on the main page. It gets changed daily, and contains information about the place in the image too.  But there isn't any way to download the image to our computer directly."

<a href="http://www.bing.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bing.com/', 'Bing']);" >Bing</a>, as we know, is slowly increasing their user base. Whether the reason is its novelty or usefulness is a different debate altogether. But one of the interesting features in Bing is the background image that appears on the main page. It gets changed daily, and contains information about the place in the image too.  But there isn&#8217;t any way to download the image to our computer directly. We **cannot **save the image by using right click -> Save Image As. So here&#8217;s the trick. First of all we&#8217;ll need Firefox. Now open <a href="http://www.bing.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bing.com/', 'Bing']);" >Bing</a> in it and follow the steps:

  * Go to **Tools **
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10917" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/tools.png" alt="tools" width="330" height="333" />

  * Now click on **Page Info**
  * In the new pop-up that opened, click on the **Media** tab.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10916" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/media.jpg" alt="Media" width="500" />

  * Now search for the image. Just click on any link, and you will get the preview of it at the bottom. [**Hint**: The link to the background image will mostly be the longest one.]
  * Now just select the **Save As..** button at the bottom right corner of the window. Your Done!
