Google recently launched a [video campaign to market its web browser &#8211; Google Chrome with the help of 11 short films][1], telling the users what Chrome is all about. Google then released Chrome Shorts on the YouTube channel that seemed to receive a good response.

Seeing this, Google has now decided to show this to a wider set of audience. With the help of their <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords/tvads/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/adwords/tvads/', 'Google TV Ads']);" >Google TV Ads</a> team, Google will run the Chrome Ad Campaign on various television networks starting this weekend.

### But Why?

As per Google,

  1. To raise awareness of the Chrome browser amongst the masses.
  2. To help understand how television can supplement their other online media campaigns.

Google believes that Chrome is a browser that combines a minimal design with sophisticated technology to make the web faster, safer, and easier. With all <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/more-security-issues-with-google-chrome/" target="_self">the security problems around it that weâ€™ve seen in the recent past</a>, I am sure many of us disagree with what is being stated.

In spite of that, Googleâ€™s innovative ad campaign does seem to be attention-grabbing (no doubts about that). The short films creatively demonstrate Chromeâ€™s capabilities in the simplest way possible, so that even a non-techie could understand.

(Probably mass advertizing is their last ditch effort to get people to use it after all.) ðŸ˜›

To view all of the Chrome shorts, you may go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/googlechrome" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/googlechrome', 'ChromeShorts.com']);" >ChromeShorts.com</a>. You could also view the videos on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/googlechrome" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/googlechrome', 'YouTube channel']);" >YouTube channel</a>.

If not, then simply wait and try and catch it on your television set. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
