Yesterday I came across a online tool called <a href="http://www.intodit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.intodit.com/', 'Intodit']);" >Intodit</a> to create a Wiki on just about anything. This is quite useful to create documentation or have a group working on a project to create a reference guide for some day in the future.

It can also be used for non-professional needs like creating a wiki for a city or even on a hobby. Wiki is a great way to learn as you can also involve other people with similar interests to add to the wiki and make it more comprehensive.

### <a href="http://www.intodit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.intodit.com/', 'Intodit']);" >Intodit</a> Features

  * First I needed to register and create an account. Then I needed to select &#8216;Create a wiki&#8217;.
  * I could create multiple wikis on the same account with [Intodit][1].
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">I could also invite my friends to use and edit the wiki with their email ids.</span>
  * Once I started creating new pages and editing them, the dashboard was quite easy to use and had many options.
  * It does support different fonts, allows inserting images and also has support for adding widgets which are video, music and chat related. (see image below)

This seems like a ideal tool for people who have expertise on something, want to create a wiki and collaborate with others having with similar interests.
