Blogger.com, the world&#8217;s widely used blogging platform is now adding new features and improving its technology day by day so as to retain it&#8217;s position of #8 worldwide. In this course a new feature- &#8220;Share&#8221; button has been added to the &#8220;nav bar&#8221;.With the use of this button you can share a particular post or even the whole blog and post it to Twitter, Facebook or Google Reader.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13640" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/share.png" alt="share" width="644" height="33" />

To use this feature you just have to click on the button &#8220;Share&#8221; mentioned on the &#8220;nav bar&#8221;, then select the place where you want to share the content. You can share it on Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader or even E-Mail the post but note that, E-Mail option won&#8217;t be available while sharing the whole blog.

This being a nice feature, few people find it useful because,

  1. These days, people hardly use &#8220;nav bar&#8221; with their blog.
  2. Other sharing options are much more advanced and convenient, like Twitter feed for Twitter which automatically post content to twitter.
  3. Any content posted to twitter can be shared automatically to Facebook and Orkut. Read [Update Twitter, Facebook and Orkut Status With Just One Click][1] for more info.
  4. Lots of widgets are there which gives a single click sharing option. An example is <a href="http://www.addthis.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.addthis.com/', 'AddThis']);" >AddThis</a>.

But still this new feature is welcomed by thousands of bloggers who love to blog on their favourite things.They neither need good website looking blogs nor they use adsense like ads to make some money out of their blogs. üòâ
