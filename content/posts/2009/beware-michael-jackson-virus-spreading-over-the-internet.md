Most search trends over internet are all about &#8216;Michael Jackson&#8217; ever since he died. The spammers are spreading [malware][1] and viruses all over internet to capitalize on this trend. Security researcher at Sophos warned against Jackson spam and viruses.

It is spreading via email containing the subject line **&#8220;Remembering Michael Jackson&#8221;. **The email contains zip file saying secret songs and photos of Michael Jackson. People download the file and their PCs get infected.

> Graham Cluley, Senior technology consultant at Sophos said:
> 
> &#8220;The e-mail, which claims to come from sarah@michaeljackson.com, says that the attached ZIP file contains secret songs and photos of Michael Jackson.&#8221;

This malware also spreads via USB devices. There is another email spreading viruses which steals the passwords that claims to have the exclusive [YouTube video][3] of the last work of Michael Jackson.

So, if you are getting such emails then be careful before opening it.
