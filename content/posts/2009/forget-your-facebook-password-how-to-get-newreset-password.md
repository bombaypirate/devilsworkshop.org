  * Then click on the reset password button, now check your inbox of the e-mail address which you use for login. The same password reset mail will be sent to any other e-mail id too which is associated with your Facebook account.

  * After clicking on &#8216;Reset Password&#8217; button either enter the Confirmation Reset Code which you can get from your e-mail id inbox or you can simply click on the link sent to you with the confirmation code in your e-mail inbox.

  * Enter your new password, re-type it and that will be your new Facebook password.

Now you will be redirected to your homepage and next time you have to login with your new password.
