In this post, we will discuss some of the best plugins for WordPress which can deal with spam. No, not those based on Captchas or making your users solve math problems, rather we will discuss on some of the new and innovative plugins which work differently, but do the same thing, that of taking out the spam from your blog.

### Akismet

Akismet is the default plugin bundled with your WordPress software. When a new comment, trackback, or pingback is posted on your blog, Akismet performs hundreds of tests on it and gives a thumbs up or thumbs down.

### WP Spam Free

Most of the spambots cannot process javascript and cookies. This plugin takes the advantage of this and uses a dynamic combination of javascript and cookies to separate spambots from humans, preventing 99%+ of automated spam.

### Bad Behavior

*By <a href="http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/', 'error, MarkJaquith, Firas, skeltoac']);" title="Bad Behaviour Plugin for WordPress">error, MarkJaquith, Firas, skeltoac</a>* | <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/', 'Download']);" title="Bad Behaviour Plugin for WordPress">Download</a>

Bad Behavior analyzes the HTTP headers, IP address, and other meta data sent by the visitor and determines if it is a human or a bot. After all, spammers don&#8217;t code their bots very well and if they could code very well, they probably wouldnâ€™t be spammers.

### WP Captcha Free

*By <a href="http://wordpresssupplies.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpresssupplies.com/', 'iDope']);" title="WP Captcha Free Plugin by iDope for WordPress">iDope</a>* | <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-captcha-free/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-captcha-free/', 'Download']);" title="Download WP Captcha Free Plugin for WordPress">Download</a>

WP CAPTCHA Free blocks spam on your blog by validating a hash based on time (and some other parameters) using AJAX when the comment is posted. Comments posted via bots will not have a correct hash and will be rejected.

### WP Clickcha

*By <a href="http://clickcha.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://clickcha.com/', 'iDope']);" title="WP Clickcha Plugin by iDope for WordPress">iDope</a>* | <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-clickcha/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-clickcha/', 'Download']);" title="Download WP Clickcha Plugin for WordPress">Download</a> | <a href="http://clickcha.com/demo/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://clickcha.com/demo/', 'Demo']);" title="Demo for Clickcha Plugin for WordPress">Demo</a>

<p style="text-align: left">
  Clickcha replaces your post comment button with an image based CAPTCHA that requires the user to click the image in a particular area to solve the puzzle. Clicking the image also submits the comment.<a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/10/clickcha.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-15684 aligncenter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/10/clickcha.png" alt="WP Clickcha Plugin for WordPress" width="354" height="386" /></a>

</p>

This plugin verifies the users by a piece of javascript code that indicates that the visitor is a real human being, not a spambot. If the javascript check fails, there are three options &#8211; it can either put the comment into moderation (default), put the comment in the akismet queue, or delete it.

### Conclusion

There are many plugins which can prevent spam from your blog, though neither of them can provide 100% protection from spam. In this post I have tried my best to highlight the main and best plugins that can prevent spam from your blog. If you feel that any other plugin should have been listed here, feel free to discuss it in the comment&#8217;s section below!
