**NOTE: **Unhid has not been working for a while now. URLXray is a an alternative. [Read more about it here][1].

* * *Shortened URLs have been very useful, especially with the rise of Twitter. The problem is shortened URLs give you no idea about the page you are visiting and if it is safe website to visit or not. Recently a virus is circulating with random messages along with shortened URLs on many social networking sites. Click on the URL and your computer can be affected.</p> 

On DW we have [reviewed][2] a lot of ways to creating shortened URLs but not much on doing things the other way around. This is where **<a href="http://www.unhid.co.cc/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unhid.co.cc/', 'Unhid']);" >Unhid</a>** helps. It is a website which helped me convert a shortened URL and showed me the original URL where I would be redirected.

### <a href="http://www.unhid.co.cc/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unhid.co.cc/', 'Unhid']);" >Unhid</a>

  * **Unhid** is a great way to look up which site you are being redirected to before clicking on a shortened URL.
  * I copy pasted the short URL and clicked on &#8216;**Unhide**&#8216; as shown in the image above.
  * This showed me the actualÂ URLÂ of the page I would be taken to. In this case Devils Workshop homepage. ðŸ˜‰

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I find <a href="http://www.unhid.co.cc/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unhid.co.cc/', 'Unhid']);" >Unhid</a> quite handy to make sure if I have any suspicion on where I may be redirected by a shortened URL. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Hope you too find this website useful and let me know your views and opinions through your comments.</span>
