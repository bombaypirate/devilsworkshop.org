### Skygrid provides:

  1. Real-time aggregation of the financial news
  2. Presents it in a neatly designed flash user interface
  3. Allows the user to personalize their view, based on stocks, portfolio or sectors they follow
  4. Allows the user to filter news by its source type (news sites, blogs, press releases, etc.)
  5. Allow the users to filter historical news over a time line.

The only thing that might stop you from saying “Great!” is that it currently is working only for public listed companies. The private companies still have time before they mark their presence on Skygrid.
