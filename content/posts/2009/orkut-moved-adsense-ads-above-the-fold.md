A bad update for all Orkut users!

Orkut started showing adsense ads above the fold now. This is at the place where you used to see **&#8220;my friends&#8221;**.

They have shifted **&#8220;my friends&#8221;** section below. [Orkut was showing adsense ads][1] from last few month but earlier they were below **&#8220;my friends&#8221;** block.

If you find this is irritating you can use [AdBlock firefox extension][3]. You will get ad-free internet not only from Orkut, but all sites! ðŸ˜‰
