However, the European Commission seems to be unhappy and wants to see consumers being offered a genuine choice of browsers.

### Avoiding the EU fines

Microsoft will be selling Windows 7 in Europe starting October 22. Europe accounts for 5 % of consumers who buy Windows software in a stand-alone pack. Microsoft has been looking to avoid new EU fines. Earlier in January, EU charged Microsoft (euro1.7 billion) following a complaint from tiny rival Norway&#8217;s Opera Software ASA. It was believed that Microsoft was unfairly using its power as the dominant OS supplier to squeeze out browser competitors.

Microsoft did however say that it will give PC users who want the browser a way to obtain it.

Mozilla and Google have signed on as third parties against Microsoft in the case. Although Microsoft&#8217;s browser is the most widely used worldwide, but Firefox is gaining in popularity and Google, has released its own Web browser, Chrome.
