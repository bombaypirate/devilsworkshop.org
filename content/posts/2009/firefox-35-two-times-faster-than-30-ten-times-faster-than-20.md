Release Candidate 2 is the first version of Firefox 3.5 that average users might want to run, since it&#8217;s faster and more stable than the beta versions were.

Firefox 3.5 boasts a number of significant changes &#8211; ranging from new ways to work with the browser features to under-the-hood improvements that Mozilla developers say will make the browser more than twice as fast as Firefox 3 and ten times faster than 2.0 (based on the results of a SunSpider test of JavaScript performance on a Windows XP machine).

Here are some of the new features you&#8217;ll find in Firefox 3.5.
