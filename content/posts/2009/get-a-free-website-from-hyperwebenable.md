  Yes, you can now turn your blogs at www.yourname.blogspot.com [any blogging platform] to www.yourname.com provided the name is available. If not you can choose a different domain name from the available list.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  HyperWebEnable is a free web hosting service with as many as 400 websites and blogs provided till date. This will be really helpful for those who cannot afford for web hosting expenses. But there will be limited control on your HyperWebEnable hosted blog. You can even get multiple websites freely with unlimited bandwidth and email ids and many more services that the paid services.
