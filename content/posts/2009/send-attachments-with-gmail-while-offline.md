I am pretty sure that many of you might have heard of <a href="http://gmail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmail.com', 'Gmail']);" >Gmail</a> being available in [offline mode][1]. This mode which is still in **Labs**, allows me to use my Gmail account while I am offline. It supports conversation threading, search function along with composing and looking up Emails.

### Offline Gmail

  * When Gmail is in offline mode it uses Google gears to store data on your computer for you to access all your mails. It becomes more or less like a desktop application rolled into a web application.
  * This is quite helpful if the internet connection is unstable or keeps dropping. **Gmail** in offline mode gets notified when the connection is back on and downloads all the new mails to your computer along with sending the ones your have composed.
  * This if truly great when you are travelling and might have trouble with connectivity issues.

The trouble with <a href="http://gmail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmail.com', 'Gmail']);" >Gmail</a> in offline mode was that it did not allow me to send attachments. That has all changed sinceÂ <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/send-attachments-while-offline.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/send-attachments-while-offline.html', 'Google announced']);" >Google announced</a> that attachments will beÂ availableÂ for people using **Gmail** in offline mode.

If you do not know how to got in offline mode with Gmail, use the following steps.

  * Click on **Settings** and then select **Labs**.
  * Select **Enable** next to **Offline Gmail**.Â Click **Save Changes**.
  * After refreshing or when Gmail reloads you will see a new **&#8220;Offline&#8221;** link in the upper righthand corner next to your username on Gmail page.
  * Click on **Offline** link to start the offline set up process.

Having a feature to allow attachments actually makes theÂ experienceÂ of being offline with **Gmail** a lot more smoother than before andÂ I won&#8217;t be surprised if this feature in Gmail graduates out of **Labs** soon and also becomes a regular part of Chrome OS. ðŸ˜‰
