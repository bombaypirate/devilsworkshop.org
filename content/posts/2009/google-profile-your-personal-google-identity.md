    As you might be knowing already, Google profile has been around for quite some time, however, never really made it big. But it is now being integrated in most Google services allowing the user to have a uniform identity.
    
    Google profile will automatically connect you to your other Google contacts. This means that your contacts will get access to your complete profile, and vice versa. This will also allow you to connect your Google Profile to Google Maps and your Picasa photos albums.

As you might be knowing already, Google profile has been around for quite some time, however, never really made it big. But it is now being integrated in most Google services allowing the user to have a uniform identity.

Google profile will automatically connect you to your other Google contacts. This means that your contacts will get access to your complete profile, and vice versa. This will also allow you to connect your Google Profile to Google Maps and your Picasa photos albums.

#### According to Google:

> *“A Google profile is simply how you present yourself on Google products to other Google users. It allows you to control how you appear on Google and tell others a bit more about who you are. With a Google profile, you can easily share your web content on one central location.”*

### Features:

  1. **Receive messages** by enabling the “Send a message” feature to allow anyone with a Google Account to email you without revealing your email address. (Unless you are OK with spam, I am not sure how many people would like to do that. Somehow, this feature appears a little foolish to me)
  2. **Add photos** from Flickr or Picasa. (Make sure you re-check your Picasa settings to decide on what you really want to share in public)
  3. **Create a page about you** in the **About me** tab and tell people about yourself.
  4. **Add your contact information** and be sure of whom you are letting this info out to. There is a way to control that, so make use of it! (Unless you don’t mind strangers stalking you!)
  5. **Add links to your other profiles and sites** like your Blogger blog, public Picasa Web Albums, Google Reader shared items, Twitter, MySpace, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
  6. **Show your location** on a map with your current location and places you&#8217;ve lived.

I don’t have a Google profile yet, maybe because the idea of creating one sounds a little scary to me. It would only expose my personal profile details and even photos to a whole bunch of people. Google profile appears to be a very PUBLIC space.

However, if you wish to try this out yourself, here’s the link – <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/me/editprofile?edit=h#about" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/profiles/me/editprofile?edit=h#about', 'Create your Profile']);" >Create your Profile</a>
