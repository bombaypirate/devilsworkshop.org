**Knowledge Base** is usually a database which stores information on a specific subject. Usually it is used for technical trouble shooting steps and the updating is done by an individual or an assigned team of experts. Microsoft has a knowledge base and usually the articles stored in a knowledge base has separate KB ids.

**Alex Personal Knowledge Base** is a free software which allows you to create your own personal Knowledge Base on your computer.

### Knowledge Base and Wiki

  * The first question you might think of is why use **Knowledge Base** when you already have easy to use [Wikis on the internet][1]. The reason is simple. Knowledge Base has traditionally known to document trouble-shooting steps rather than all information.
  * Lets say for instance you are creating a software. When faced with bugs or errors you can note down the various reasons why things went wrong and you actually have a troubleshooting guide.
  * A lot of companies prefer knowledge base instead of wikis as knowledge base is more defined and controlled rather than online wikis.

### Alex Knowledge Base software

Installing the Knowledge Base software is quite easy. It is installed on your computer and can be exported to another computer with the **export** option.

One of the main examples of Knowledge Base being helpful is <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://support.microsoft.com/', 'Microsoft&#8217; Knowledge Bas']);" >Microsoft&#8217; Knowledge Bas</a>e. If you search for trouble shooting steps on Microsoft website, you will get to see their kb articles. **Alex Knowledge Base** is not really meant for companies but for personal projects. It could also be used as a pilot Knowledge Base before moving on to a bigger and more sophisticated software.
