Also one of our service, <a href="http://www.orkutfeeds.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutfeeds.com/', 'OrkutFeeds']);" >OrkutFeeds</a>, was completely down for one week. Reason was continuous rise in traffic for both Devils Workshop and OrkutFeeds.

### We do not blame Dreamhost…

We do not blame [Dreamhost][1] as they always offered more than one can expect from a shared hosting plan. From long time, we were planning to move to Virtual Private Server(VPS) hosting. But making a choice between <a href="http://www.dreamhostps.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dreamhostps.com/', 'Dreamhost Private Servers (PS)']);" >Dreamhost Private Servers (PS)</a> and <a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/dv/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/dv/', 'Mediatemple dedicated virtual (dv) hosting']);" >Mediatemple dedicated virtual (dv) hosting</a> is really tough. We have many open questions about Mediatemple which need 2-3 weeks time to sort them out.

For time being, we have shifted our web and mysql server to Dreamhost’s Private Servers. We will monitor our sites performance closely and then we will make final decision whether to continue on Dreamhost or move *our high traffic sites* to Mediatemple.

### We will be on Dreamhost always…

One thing is sure, even if we decide to move to Mediatemple, we will continue to host our non-profit services like Orkutfeeds on Dreamhost shared hosting plans as long as possible. We just can’t afford paying private server charges for free services. Its OK for us, if our free services run slowly.

Also we offered free hosting on our Dreamhost account to few non-profit organizations, friends and some of our readers. They all run low traffic websites which don’t require virtual private servers.

### Things we like about Dreamhost PS…

  * **Moving to PS was very smooth**. Only thing I remember was clicking on ***“Enable PS” ***option from control panel.
  * **Dedicated IP** &#8211; Every private server gets a dedicated IP. Dedicated IPs have many advantages. One of them is better treatment from anti-spam plugins like <a href="http://akismet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://akismet.com/', 'akismet']);" >akismet</a>.
  * If something goes wrong on any of our site, we can instantly reboot our server.

### Things we *don’t *like about Dreamhost PS…

  * You can not be selective about Dreamhost PS. Its either for all sites/users or for none. Given a choice, at this stage, we would have moved only Devils Workshop & <a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/', 'OrkutDiary']);" >OrkutDiary</a> to PS.
  * Cost! Dreamhost’s shared hosting plan offers best value for your money. Same is not true with their VPS solution.
  * Same control panel. Dreamhost have one of the best control panel but what we need exclusive support for reselling and ability to manage resources on per site/client basis.

I will update you with more details about Dreamhost Private Servers soon as we explore it. If you are among our regular visitors, please let us know if you can see any improvement in speed. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
