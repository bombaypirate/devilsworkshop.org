Now looking for graduation subject? What are your options? Engineering&#8230; MBBS&#8230; BCom, then CA? Ahh&#8230; the same old career options.

I am sure many of us feel the same way. &#8220;I need more choices&#8230; more scope to enhance my creative talent! There must be a &#8216;hidden&#8217; option somewhere out there!&#8221; Well there is good news people. There are more alternatives to choose from and this post is just about that &#8212; it is about the world of **ANIMATION**!

I think it&#8217;s still a path less known. Not many are aware of this industry and consider this as a sound career option. So here are a few facts to help you get acquainted with this industry:

<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5610" title="Garfield and Ody" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/04/garfieldwallpaper800-150x150.jpg" alt="Garfield and Ody" width="150" height="150" />

  1. Indian animation industry was approximately worth Rs.12 billion in 2006 while its estimated worth by end 2009 is Rs.42 billion. That is an impressive growth of 83% (avg) on year.
  2. Domestic animation studios like Toonz Animation, Crest Communication, Maya Entertainment, UTV Toons, Zee have picked up lots of good US and domestic projects in recent years. They even plan to produce full feature length 3D animation movies in the coming years.
  3. Growth potential in India is enormous as India has large pool of talented young people. If trained properly, they can be the biggest asset of the Indian animation industry. This is clearly visible by the trends in the companies like Arena multimedia, which offers several full time, long length diploma programs in animation.

India thus has a huge potential for outsourced projects from the US and Europe. The trend has already picked up momentum as many big production studios like Walt Disney, Warner Brothers, Sony etc. are outsourcing work to India. Many special effects in the movies like Independence Day or Pearl Harbour were done in Indian studios.
