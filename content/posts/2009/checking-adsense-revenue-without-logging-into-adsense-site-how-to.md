There are chances that you log-in to your adsense dashboard each morning to check your revenue reports, etc. So, here in this post I am going to mention various ways using which you can check your Adsense revenue reports without logging into the adsense dashboard periodically. 

### Firefox Add-on for Checking Adsense Revenue

[<img class="wp-image-52311" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="94" alt="why do work adsense addon" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/whydoworkadsenseaddon_thumb.png" width="299" align="right" border="0" />][1] You can either install a Firefox add-on â€“<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12735" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12735', 'Why do work adsense Monitor']);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Why do work adsense Monitor</a> that will continuously keep updating (refer the image) you about your adsense earnings on the Firefox status bar or you can even get adsense reports directly from Adsense team periodically which we will be discussing later on this post.

If you want to continuously keep tracking your adsense revenue and other reports such as CTR and eCPM then <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12735" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12735', 'this Firefox add-on']);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this Firefox add-on</a> is the best way, as it will keeps syncing the data in your Adsense dashboard. Once you download the plugin you will have to provide your adsense login credentials for this plugin to work.

### Email reports for Adsense Earnings

Recently I came to know that, you can even subscribe for daily reports from Adsense team containing the reports for the previous day. <a href="http://www.techpavan.com/2009/09/09/setup-adsense-earnings-daily-email-reports-track-adsense-inbox/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techpavan.com/2009/09/09/setup-adsense-earnings-daily-email-reports-track-adsense-inbox/', 'Pavan has explained']);" target="_blank">Pavan has explained</a> in detail on how to get adsense earning report on your mail box daily or over a given time period.
