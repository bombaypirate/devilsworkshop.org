Any student using Google Docs previously must have realized the difficulty in inserting mathematical and scientific equations into a document. Google has now added a new feature which allows you to type in the equation with many pre-set symbols. Very aptly this new feature in Google Docs is called &#8216;**Equation Editor**&#8216;

### Equation Editor

  * When you open a Google Document just click on Insert and then select Equation. This will pop up the Equation Editor to be used.
  * Equation Editor can easily display complex equations in a way which is similar to the way we write them on paper.
  * This is a tool to input and display equations and not to solve them. It is not a program for calculating results on equations. I guess if that is ever achieved by Google no one will learn how to solve equations. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
