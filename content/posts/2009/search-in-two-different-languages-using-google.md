A few days ago I wrote about Google Search allowing you to [translate the search query][1] into a different languages. It was brought to my notice that there were other options to do the same on the internet.

<a href="http://www.2lingual.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.2lingual.com/', '2Lingual.com']);" ><strong>2Lingual.com</strong></a> is one such website and I must admit it&#8217;s layout is much better than the Google search translate option.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17822" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Search with different languages" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/Search_different_languages.png" alt="Search with different languages" width="550" height="281" />

It has a simplistic interface. It shows up two separate search layouts one next to the other. Near the search bar there is a drop down option to select the language.

In the image above, the links to the left are from the English search while I has selected French on the right side and it has conducted a search of the translated query. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

It supports 52 languages seems like a pretty useful tool. Try it out at <a href="http://www.2lingual.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.2lingual.com/', '2Lingual.com']);" >2Lingual.com</a> and let me know if you know about similar tools through your comments.
