Its been long since we last posted a working Godaddy coupon code for purchasing .COM domains. So, if you are waiting to purchase a domain, then its the right time you can get one for just $2.99. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Coupon Code: **299BUYCOM**

### Things to remember:

  * Code applicable only for .com domain purchases
  * Code applicable only for new Godaddy customers. If you are an existing Godaddy customer, youâ€™ll have to open a new account on Godaddy and then transfer the domain to your primary Godaddy account free of cost.
  * Unlike customary domain purchases, if you would like to use this coupon code, you will have to make the payment either via a credit card or by check!
  * As you can see on the screenshot, $2.99 is the basic charge. The total checkout amount would come to $3.17 including taxes and ICANN charges.

**Update: **

As commented by Pavan, this coupon is valid for existing customers as well!

**Update:**

As pointed by Martin, this coupon is no more valid and you cannot get a domain using this coupon anymore.
