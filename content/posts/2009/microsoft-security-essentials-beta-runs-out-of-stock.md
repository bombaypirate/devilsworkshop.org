Available for download on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials', 'Microsoft website']);" >Microsoft website</a> in select countries (for users in the US, Israel and Brazil), the beta version of [Microsoft Security Essentials][1] or [Morro ][2]appeared to be a huge hit. The software was available for public download from June 23, 2009 for the first 75,000 users. However, the limit of 55,000 downloads reserved for the US and Israel was reached within 24 hours.

## Limited Downloads

Apparently, a limit for the number of downloads was set as follows:

  * 20,000 downloads reserved for Brazilian users
  * 55,000 downloads reserved for US and Israel combined

### Alert! Too late mate…

All those attempting a download the beta from the Microsoft site now, will get an Alert on the web page:

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/image-thumb4.png" border="0" alt="image" width="553" height="115" />
</p>

  However, Microsoft said that they might increase the number of downloads in the future if the need arises.
</p>

## Why the Restriction?

Microsoft said the restriction on the number of downloads was based on their ability to support the beta while still maintaining their commitment to delivering a quality product in the time frame promised.

The final version of the antivirus will be released in 19 countries during the second half of 2009.

## Scope of License?

The software is licensed, not sold, which means you have only some rights to use the software, while Microsoft reserves all other rights.

As per Microsoft, you may **NOT**:

  * **Make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation**;
  * **Publish the software for others to copy**;
  * **Rent, lease or lend the software;**
  * Transfer the software or this agreement to any third party;
  * Use the software for commercial software hosting services;
  * Disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software to any third party without Microsoft’s prior written approval;
  * Work around any technical limitations in the software;
  * Reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation.

## High-quality protection against Malicious Software

Microsoft claims that the software will provide high-quality protection against Viruses, Trojans, Worms, Spyware and other malicious software. The software would update and upgrade automatically. This free service is looking to compete directly with McAfee and Symantec.

Microsoft had previously offered security software called Windows Live OneCare by subscription – a commercial flop. Microsoft had announced in November that it plans to burry that product suite. Windows Live OneCare will continue to be sold for Windows XP and Windows Vista at retail through June 30, 2009. Direct sales of OneCare will now be gradually phased out with the arrival of Microsoft Security Essentials.
