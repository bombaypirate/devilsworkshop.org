Facebook now a days has became a social networking necessity rather than a just another social networking tool. No wonder, half of the people open Facebook as the first site while starting up their browsers in the morning. Facebook has all the features which one can expect from a social networking website. O<span style="background-color: #ffffff">ne of the most crucial features of Facebook are the <strong>events.</strong></span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff">Events were introduced in Facebook to make a bridge between the cyber social newtorking and the real life events and parties. With the help of events, you can create an online invitation of your party or function and can invite guests.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff">But <strong>Google Calender</strong> has been doing all the remembering thing for us, for ages. Let it be remembering birthdays of our pals, or remembering important meetings. Wouldn&#8217;t it be easy, if in any way, Facebook events and Google Calender can be synchronized? Well, there is a way:</span>

  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">Click your left bar on Facebook and go to Events.</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">Click on Export Events on the top.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-590" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/link.jpeg" alt="link" width="466" height="245" />

  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">You&#8217;ll get a url. That will be of iCal format. But it doesn&#8217;t matter for now. Note it down.</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">Login to your google calender.</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">Click <strong>ADD</strong> on the lower left side and then click <strong>Add from url.</strong></span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-589" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/google-calender.jpeg" alt="google calender" width="510" height="194" />

  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">Copy the url which Facebook gave you.</span>
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">And you&#8217;re DONE!</span>

Now, your Google Calender and Facebook Events are synchronized. All your Facebook events data will be now handled by Google Calender. Happy Facebooking!
