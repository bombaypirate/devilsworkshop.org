I’ve known a lot of people who often find it hard to trust online weather websites mostly because different sites give different results, some of which aren’t even recent or accurate.

Well, for all those who have been facing this problem, this attractive yet useful weather website called <a href="http://weatherflash.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weatherflash.com/', 'WeatherFlash']);" >WeatherFlash</a> could just be the answer.

WeatherFlash is a clean, classy, colorful website that gives you weather forecast for all world cities through dials, graphs and charts. The best past about this website is that the information is constantly updated, which means you can be sure of getting the latest updates for every minute.

### How does it work?

WeatherFlash pulls its data from Environment Canada, NOAA, and BBC Weather.

It’s very simple to search for results. You could easily find what you are looking for by entering the name of a city in the search box. The exact climatic data will be triggered by the system within seconds.

My traveler friend recently told me about this website and I personally like it and find it to be trustworthy.

If anyone knows of any better weather website, please feel free to share the links.
