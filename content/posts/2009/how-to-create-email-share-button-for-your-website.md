You might have noticed the tweet counter we have with all our posts. This **Tweet counter** actually helps you to **Retweet** the link of the post to your **Twitter** followers in case you like what you read.

Here is a website which allows you to introduce a <a href="http://getmailcounter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://getmailcounter.com', 'Mail Counter']);" ><strong>Mail Counter</strong></a> for your posts or articles on the web.

The counter adds up the number of times a post has been shared via email. All it requires you to do is add a **Java Script** code into your website (see image below).

<a href="http://getmailcounter.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://getmailcounter.com/', '']);" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17708" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Java Script code for Email Counter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/email_counter2.png" alt="Java Script code for Email Counter" width="412" height="150" /></a>

It also has support for **WordPress** where in you can enter a different code into your single.php or index.php files. Do look up their <a href="http://getmailcounter.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://getmailcounter.com/', 'website']);" >website</a> for the code.

Majority of subscribers still subscribe to a blog through e-mail rather using feed readers. This feature makes quite a bit of sense considering that a lot of people might want to share your content with email.

Hope you like the **Email counter** and find it useful. Let me know what you think about it through your comments.
