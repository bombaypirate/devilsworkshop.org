The Laptop named Nokia 3G Booklet was expected ever since [Intel and Nokia joined hands][1] back in June. Nokia had already made noises about entering the Laptop market ever since February this year. The obvious question most people asked was &#8220;Why was the cell phone giant entering the laptop market?&#8221;

The two obvious reasons are that the Mobile market is getting saturated and for growth prospects Nokia needs to branch out to tap other revenue earning opportunities.  The other reason is that Nokia has its eye on Apple ( PC and Laptop manufacturing) entering the mobile market with its iPhone products and also [Dell looking to enter the smart phone market][2].

Nokia gave out details of the 3G Booklet at Stuttgart at an event on Sept 2 2009.
