The idea is not new, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/whats-on/#movies" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/itunes/whats-on/#movies', 'Apple&#8217;s iTunes']);" >Apple&#8217;s iTunes</a> already does and sells movies online but if YouTube started showing rental movies online it would be the first time YouTube will end up charging its users for anything. üòê

I was reading in an article YouTube can get almost a $100 Billion in revenues if it provided statistical details to its high end corporate users. Often many plans have been talked about on &#8216;How to monetize YouTube?&#8217;

But for a website which is famous for showing clips, advertisements and movie previews and trailers the natural step forward would be to show films online.

### How does Google plan to do it.

  * YouTube its said and already in talks with Lions Gate, Sony and even Warner Bros.
  * Plans are afoot to show movies with a charge of $3.00 which for the US market is perfect.
  * It will directly start to compete with other film content websites like Netflix and Amazon VOD
