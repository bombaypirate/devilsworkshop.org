<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9970" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/image7.jpg" alt="image7" width="230" height="177" />A dedicated cyber crime police station, the first-of-its-kind in Maharashtra, third in India only the after the ones in the IT Hub Bangalore and Hyderabad has started functioning on May 30 in Bandra-Kurla Complex at suburbs of Mumbai.

According to one of the officials &#8220;The facility has been equipped with state of the art modern technology and advanced software&#8221;.

> According to Additional Police Commissioner (Crime) Deven Bharti,
> 
> &#8220;The dedicated police station will now register first information report on its own and investigate the offences pertaining to cyber space. The police station will take care of all cyber cases in the city including that of terror e-mails.&#8221;.

This facility will function under the supervision of Deputy Commissioner of Police (Preventive) and Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). A specially trained team of over 25 policemen, headed by an ACP (Assistant Commissioner of Police), has been selected for the new job.

This unit has state-wide jurisdiction and will tackle issues like threat emails, financial terrorism(money-laundering). It seems that the present Cyber Crime Investigation Cell (CCIC) of  Mumbai will be absorbed into this new unit.

How effectively these new police stations can tackle the cyber crime and cyber terrorism is yet to be seen. Personally i am of the opinion that these kind of high tech and well equipped cyber crime police stations should come up quickly at each  state&#8217;s capital at least.
