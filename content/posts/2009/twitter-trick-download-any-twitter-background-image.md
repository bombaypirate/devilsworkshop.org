It&#8217;s a huge micro blogging website and it has changed the meaning of micro blogging. Now micro blogging is like fashion. If you are not using twitter, I think you are missing out on something.

Today, I am going to write about a simple twitter trick. We all use different kinds of backgrounds on our twitter profile. Some people like to use pretty images and some use costume twitter backgrounds. You can show your brand, logo, personal details and more. You just need to edit it and make it however you want.

Here you can learn how to hack any twitter background.

Today, I had been reading <a href="http://twitter.com/babygirlparis" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/babygirlparis', '@babygirlparis']);" target="_blank">@babygirlparis</a> (Paris Hilton) updates. I love this girl, she is just awesome. After reading I saw an image in her background and I wanted to see which pic she is using in her background.

So I go to page source and search about that pic. So here is the tip on How I can download Paris Hilton&#8217;s twitter background.

You need to search this to grab any twitter background image.
