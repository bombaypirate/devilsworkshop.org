Dell claims that through its Twitter activity there has been an increase in the sale of their Dell computers and has earned more than $2 million in revenue from its @DellOutlet since 2007.

According to TwitterCounter, @DellOutlet is getting close to the top 50 most followed Twitter users.

> *“We’ve surpassed $2 million in revenue in terms of Dell Outlet sales, but we’re also seeing that it’s driving interest in new product as well. We’re seeing people come from @DellOutlet on Twitter into the Dell.com/outlet site, and then ultimately decide to purchase a new system from elsewhere on Dell.com. If we factor those new system purchases that come from @DellOutlet, we’re actually eclipsed $3 million in overall sales.”*

Since June of 2007, Dell’s follower base on Twitter grew substantially from 11,000 followers to over 600,000. Considering the number of followers and the big bucks it has been earning through Twitter, I’d say it sure is good news for Dell. Twitter, however, could learn a little “something” from this!
