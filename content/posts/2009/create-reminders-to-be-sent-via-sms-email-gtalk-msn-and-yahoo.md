Have you ever had this experiance that you wanted to call someone in the evenings and forgot every evening only to remember in the mornings? I often face this and sometimes I wish when its evening I had something to remind me about that call I have to make. I came across a website which does just that.

<a href="http://www.memorari.us" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.memorari.us', 'Memorari']);" >Memorari</a> is a nice web site which allows users to set reminders and then send them over SMS, Email, ICQ, MSN, AOL messenger, Jabber and Yahoo chat. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  * The website&#8217;s simplicity is what I liked best. No need so sign-in or register was also something that makes it easy to use.
  * This is not really a meeting scheduler where you can add details, it more like a one line reminder. So this is more useful on reminding yourself about chores or calls which often slip our minds.
  * If you want to remind yourself of an appointment this works great as I can simply send an SMS reminder to myself.
  * I tested the SMS reminder service and was quite impressed with it. It does support a huge list of mobile services from all over the world that is quite impressive.
