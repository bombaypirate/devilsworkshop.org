<img class="alignright wp-image-53066" style="border: 0pt none;margin-left: 12px;margin-right: 12px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/07/clip-image00222.jpg" border="0" alt="clip_image002" hspace="12" width="240" height="85" align="right" />When the competition is stiff, you often need to think of new innovative ways to mark a difference. The social networking market, with giants such as Facebook, Twitter, My Space, Orkut, etc. already thriving, the entry of a new social network into the market can be quite a challenge. That’s why Vyoom – a social community site comes with a twist. Words like FREE or PRIZES often catches a lot of attention, and that’s exactly what it has done to make people flock to its site.

The users are rewarded with points for chit-chatting and socializing which other members, and these points can be later redeemed for REAL LIFE PRIZES that the user wants. So why not get rewarded for the things you already do? Sounds like a great idea to me.
