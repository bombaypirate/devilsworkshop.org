### **Update: **[Migration is completed now][1].  You may like to check [Why Dreamhost PS is a Pathetic Server – 5 Reasons][2]

* * *This is to inform all our readers/contributors that we are finally moving Devils Workshop, Orkut Diary and few other sites to 

<a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/dv/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/dv/', 'MediaTemple']);" >MediaTemple</a>.</p> 

We had recently shifted to [Dreamhost PS][3] but unlike shared Dreamhost service, our experience was too painful to continue anymore on Dreamhost PS. As I have mentioned earlier, we will continue to host most of our small sites on Dreamhost.

So this migration may result in few hours downtime for sites listed below only, including any subdomains they have.

  1. [Devils Workshop][4]
  2. <a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/', 'Orkut Diary']);" >Orkut Diary</a>
  3. <a href="http://www.orkutbuddy.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutbuddy.com/', 'Orkut Buddy']);" >Orkut Buddy</a>
  4. rtCamp 

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">To all contributors, please do not post any comment/article as of now. We will notify you all again with a blog post once migration gets completed.</span> **Update:** You can start posting now as [migration is completed][1]. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Sorry for inconvenience and considerable downtime you have experienced in last 3-4 days. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I will write in more details about Dreamhost PS (Pathetic Server) once this mighty task gets completed.
