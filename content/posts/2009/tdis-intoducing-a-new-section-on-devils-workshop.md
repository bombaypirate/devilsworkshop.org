title: TDIS – Introducing a new section on Devils Workshop
author: rahul286
date: 2009-04-05
excerpt: In this new section readers can share their personal experience related to Internet, technology, social networking and other technology related stuff. Unlike other articles, where we demand technical tips, tricks, hacks, tutorials, etc which can be directly “used” by others, goal of this section is to give our readers a platform to share their views.

Few days back, <a href="http://www.callingallgeeks.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.callingallgeeks.org/', 'Vaibhav Kanwal']);" >Vaibhav Kanwal</a> posted about [his experience with Linux][1]. As an editor, I was initially reluctant to publish that article as it was based on more personal experience. But as a strong and active community many of our reader participated in healthy discussion surrounding that topic.

Since then we were thinking about starting a section on Devils Workshop where our readers can share their personal experience related to Internet, technology, social networking and other technology related stuff. Unlike other articles, where we demand technical tips, tricks, hacks, tutorials, etc which can be directly **used** by others, goal of this section is to give our readers a platform to share their **views**.

You can use this new section to initiate healthy debate/discussion or collect a feedback on a topic on your mind. You no need to be a formal blogger to write in this section. Of course, you can run still [run your adsense ads on your articles][2].

## TDIS &#8211; Thank Devil It&#8217;s Sunday!

This will be a weekly feature, published on Sunday only. We choose Sunday, because its holiday for most people. So rather than brainstorming with another technical how-to guide, its better to indulge in lighter discussion.

Of course, if we get more articles for this series, me may consider increasing frequency of posts in this new section.

### A note for non-bloggers&#8230;

We hope participation from many non-blogger readers. They may find registration process and using WordPress platform to publish articles little harder. In that case, they can email their articles to our editor team at email id &#8211; **editor@devilsworkshop.org**. Please add word **[TDIS]** into subject line.

If you want to publish your article anonymously, its fine with us. Otherwise include 2-3 lines about yourself in the beginning of that email.

### More experiments&#8230;

First we thank you Vaibhav for posting his own experience which gave us this idea. We are open to more experiments on Devils Workshop. After all its a community blog!

So feel free to use our [forum][3], [contact form][4] or comment section to suggest new ideas/sections which you will like to see on Devils Workshop. If you can contribute towards your idea, that will be a plus!
