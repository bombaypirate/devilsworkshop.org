Last month I wrote about a Firefox add-on which installs a [meeting scheduler][1] for **Gmail**. The meetingÂ schedulerÂ was pretty decent with a lot of options for scheduling a meeting and inviting others for the same. It was seamlessly integrated with Gmail.

### Does you chrome have extensions?

Make sure your **Chrome browser** supports **extensions**. This means the browser has to be a beta version and not a stable version. Ideally you need to upgrade to **Chrome 4 beta** version. Download Chrome 4 from Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/', 'landing page for Chrome beta versions']);" >landing page for Chrome beta versions</a>.

### Meeting Scheduler with Gmail

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17885" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Gmail meeting scheduler with chrome extensions" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/Gmail_meeting_scheduler_chrome_extensions1.png" alt="Gmail meeting scheduler with chrome extensions" width="550" height="350" />

  * Downloading Scheduler extensions is quite easy. Just visit the <a href="http://www.chromeextensions.org/other/meeting-scheduler-for-gmail/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chromeextensions.org/other/meeting-scheduler-for-gmail/', 'Meeting Scheduler extensions page']);" >Meeting Scheduler extensions page</a> on <a href="http://www.chromeextensions.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chromeextensions.org', 'ChromeExtensions.org']);" >ChromeExtensions.org</a>.
  * Once installed log into Gmail account and you will see to the right hand side of your Gmail page aÂ **Meeting Scheduler <span style="font-weight: normal">box.</span>**
  * **<span style="font-weight: normal">If you were using </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Meeting Scheduler</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> with </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Firefox</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> browser, it is synced with </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Chrome</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> browser thanks to this extension.</span>**
  * Here you can create meetings, schedule them with simple drag and select option.
  * The meeting onceÂ scheduled can be emailed to your email account. It also has the option forÂ syncingÂ meeting scheduler with Google Calendar using your Google account. ðŸ˜‰

If you were using **Meeting Scheduler **with **Firefox **giving it a try with **Chrome** Browser is worth a try. It seems a lot faster anyways.

Do let me know what you think about it through you comments.
