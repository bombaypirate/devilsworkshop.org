With Twootles, you can now run a search on Google and Twitter at the same time, making your job simpler.

As compared to the Twitter search, you might find Twootles better, as it has a number of improved features as well. Through Twootles, you could take a look at what others are looking for. This system uses the hashtag #twtls allowing easy filtering.

All searches are currently being monitored to see where all they need to build in improvements.

The search results are displayed in two columns… One column displays the Google search results, while the other column displays the Twitter search results.

For instance, when I search for “Beyonce” on Twootles, it gives me the following search results both from Google and Twitter, as a result, saving my time:
