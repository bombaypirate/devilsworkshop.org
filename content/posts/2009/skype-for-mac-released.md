<a href="http://www.skype.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.skype.com', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-50859" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="236" alt="skype-logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/01/skypelogo.jpg" width="236" align="right" border="0" /></a> As I said [earlier][1], more and more software developers are now targeting Mac users to increase their area for operation. If you remember, recently [Utorrent][2] was launched for Mac users followed by [Picasa][1] and now its time for Skype. For those who donâ€™t know what Skype is, it is said to be the best VOIP tool used for making calls via Internet. 

Well, I personally know people who prefer using Windows OS (specially XP) because it has got a huge collection of softwares and applications, to such peoples I would now say that its time for you to reconsider choosing Windows OS over Mac or Linux. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
