Have you ever thought that you mistakenly left someone important out of an email, or just spent too much time trying to decide who from your long list of contacts to include?

Some people from the Gmail team felt your pain and gave us a new Lab feature called **&#8220;Suggest More Recipients&#8221;.**

### How Does It Work?

If I wanted to send an e-mail to my family, I would insert my father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s e-mail ID and it would automatically show my sister&#8217;s and brother&#8217;s name too.

To enable it,  go to <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&fs=1&view=pu&st=labs" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&fs=1&view=pu&st=labs', 'Labs tab']);" ><strong>Labs tab</strong></a> and check &#8216;Enable&#8217; in Suggest More Recipients. Then, **Save Changes**.

That&#8217;s all! And you have Gmail&#8217;s new feature “Suggest More Recipients” at your service.
