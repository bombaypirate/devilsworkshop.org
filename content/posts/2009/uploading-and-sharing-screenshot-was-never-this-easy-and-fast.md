  If you are much addicted to the internet and always need to keep sharing <a href="http://screensnapr.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://screensnapr.com/', '']);" rel="nofollow"><img class="wp-image-52734" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/08/screensnapr.png" border="0" alt="screensnapr" width="240" height="112" align="right" /></a>screenshots to your friends online, then I doubt there may be anything easier and simpler than using a free windows utility &#8211; <a href="http://screensnapr.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://screensnapr.com/', 'ScreenSnapr']);" rel="nofollow">ScreenSnapr</a>.

  Once you download and install this amazing app for Windows, you just need to click a pre-defined shortcut key (ctrl+1 by default) on your key-board and you can select the area on your screen and immediately the selected area will be uploaded to screensnaprâ€™s website and the image URL will be copied to your clip board. If you still think this procedure complicated, then just have a look on the <a href="http://vimeo.com/5375077" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vimeo.com/5375077', 'demo video here']);" >demo video here</a> and I bet you will definitely refer this app to your friends too!
