Orkut has started sending out selected invites to some of its users to try out its new layout. I got the invite thanks to <a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/author/rahul/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/author/rahul/', 'Rahul Bansal']);" >Rahul Bansal</a>. The layout is pretty good and handy and with a lot of changes. It seems to be incorporating a lot of thing from Facebook as far as functionality is concerned.

### How different will be the new look?

*New look home page for Orkut*

  * One thing that stands outÂ immediatelyÂ is your profile pic inside a blue box (color can be changed to green, orange, pink and black). The predominant thing about it is the &#8216;What are you upto?&#8217; text box. It seems Orkut hasÂ realizedÂ people like to write more about themselves and what they are doing rather than write scraps to others. ðŸ˜›
  * There is the added functionality to add applications (another Facebook like feature). ButÂ accessingÂ the application is neatly tucked in under a &#8216;Add&#8217; button on the main page.
  * The main difference seems to be all a higher priority to updates rather than scraps. The format seems to be designed around it.

I was quite impressed with this new design even though some may complain it has taken a lot from Facebook. But I think they have got the balance right. It still has the Orkut feel to it and hence I doubt it will have much negative reaction.
