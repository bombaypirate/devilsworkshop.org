  1. ## Tera Copy
    
    Perhaps the most recognized file copier, Tera Copy is the leader in the market of external file copier&#8217;s. One of its best features is that it replaces the default Windows file copier with its own version. So you don&#8217;t have to do anything extra to copy a file via Tera Copy than Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.

      * ## Extreme Copy
        
        Extreme copy is another popular file copier. It replaces the default Windows copier with it own version, however you can disable this feature. One interesting feature of Extreme Copy is it supports Break Point which is able to pause the copying operation if or when it encounters any problems, such as file being locked, and resume back when clicked on the “Continue” button once the problem is fixed.

          * ## RichCopy
            
            Well this one&#8217;s got a history to itself. Although created in the days of Windows 95, it was used as an internal tool at Microsoft. It was not only before some months that they released it for public use. The highlight of this software is that it supports multi-threading copying, ie. multiple files are copied at once hence saving time in the copying process.

              * ## Talent Copy
                
                Talent Copy looks to better in the hardware side of file copying. It uses an advanced algorithm to limit empty HDD head moves, HDD waste, noise and power on file copying and increase file copy speed dramaticaly. In short, it is better for your hard disk than the default Windows file copier.

                  * ## Copy Handler
                    
                    Well this one doesn&#8217;t replace your default file copier, but resides comfortably in your system tray. You can call it from up there, schedule the files that you want to copy and even have an option to automatically switch off your computer once the copying is over.

                    The recommended one? Well all are good in their own right, but I prefer Tera Copy for its simplicity. Got any other alternatives? Do comment and let us know.
