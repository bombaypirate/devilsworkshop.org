Gmail Labs recently introduced a new features &#8211; &#8220;Insert Image Button&#8221;.

## Insert Images Button

This feature when activated allow you to upload/insert images into email. Until now there wasn&#8217;t anyway to add images into your email from Gmail&#8217;s WYSIWYG editor.

To activate this feature, simple go to **Gmail >> Settings >> Labs** and look for **Inserting images.** You better use browsers search feature as Gmail labs is now have more than 20 features to choose from!

### No Integration WIth Picasa

Only thing surprised me is missing integration with Picasa albums. Other Google services like [Orkut supports complete integration with Picasa][1].

### Why in Labs???

I hope such a basic feature will be added to Gmail when it will come out of beta. (Gmail is in beta for more than 5 years now!)
