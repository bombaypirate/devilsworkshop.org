But the question that is now arising is &#8211; Is the GPS close to its end or is it going to breakdown? Some experts have said that the system maybe close to breakdown or even fail as early as 2010! <!--more-->

A <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-325" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-325', 'report']);" >report</a> from GAO tells us that the US government officials are concerned that the quality of the Global Positioning System (GPS) may start to deteriorate as early as 2010, which could result in regular blackouts and failures or even telling wrong directions to people.

The US Air Force has been maintaining the GPS networks and satellites from the 1990s. According to a study by GAO, mismanagement and a lack of investment could result in the failure of some of the important GPS satellites. The report says that the Air Force has failed to successfully build the GPS satellites within the cost and schedule goals due to technical problems.

More delays might result in service outages which means millions people getting wrong directions or failed services. The military would also be affected as it uses GPS for mapping, reconnaissance and for tracking hostile targets.

If the service would fail, it would open gates for the European-funded attempt to rival America&#8217;s satellite navigation system, which would be rolled out later next year. More countries like India, Russia, and China have developed their own satellite navigation technologies that are currently being expanded.
