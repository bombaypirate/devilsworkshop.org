In last few days, you might have noticed site going down or sometimes showing weird content or no content at all. No, nothing was wrong with our server and no problem was there from our hosting company <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/go/order/?refdom=rtcamp.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mediatemple.net/go/order/?refdom=rtcamp.com', 'MediaTemple']);" >MediaTemple</a>! Only reason was, we were busy in moving all our blogs, scattered all over the Internet, into a single <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mu.wordpress.org/', 'WordPress MU']);" >WordPress MU</a> installation.

It was tougher than anticipated. WordPress MU, unlike its counterpart WordPress (standard package), is very hard to configure. Also to get expected results I needed to modify may WordPress MU core-files. In fact, in the course, I have developed a small plugin for WordPress MU which will be released into open-source after some more testing.

### So why we switched to WordPress MU&#8230;

We till now have only 3 blogs in network and one more expected to launch in a day or two. So maintaining 3-4 separate blogs isn&#8217;t tough task but maintaining 30-40 of them can be nightmare. So with WordPress MU, we are now ready to roll on many blogs into our blog network without much efforts. Setting up a new blog now is just few clicks away!

### What it mean to our contributors&#8230;

You no need to bookmark all URL&#8217;s separately to log into different blogs. All blogs will feature a log-in link in navigation menu. Just log into any blog. You can switch to other blogs with just one click.

Only problem here is, we are using different top-level domains for all our blogs so when you switch to different blog, you will be shown login box again. We recommend, checking **&#8220;Remember Me&#8221;** option. That way you need to enter username & password only once per blog and then you can switch between them seamlessly. We are trying to fix this problem as well, but till then bear with us! Sorry!

## About AdSense&#8230;

If you can notice above, there is **&#8220;My AdSense&#8221;** item in above screenshot. You can use that to configure your AdSense account. [Instructions are here][1]. You need to do this only once on any blog. Other blogs will use your AdSense settings automatically!

***Important:*** AdSenese plugin we are using to share revenue is originally developed for WordPress single-blog setup. We patched it to work for WordPress MU. As patch was applied in hurry, we request you to verify if your old posts are showing your AdSense correctly. We will soon replace this patched plugin with a new, developed for WordPress MU plugin.

### More options for our community soon&#8230;

The moment we done with fixing our WordPress MU 2.7, we came across <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/04/17/wordpress-mu-271-beta-2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/04/17/wordpress-mu-271-beta-2/', 'release post']);" >release post</a> for WordPress MU 2.7.1 beta 2. As new release is in beta and we am tired with playing with WordPress MU *(for more than a week)*, we decided to take a brake before going for new minor version. It has some really nice features which we will love to offer, but first we want to get comfortable with WordPress MU. So&#8230;

### Feedback Please&#8230;

We need your feedback as there many be few things left broken or not working. If you come across something which was there in past but broken oe missing, please let us know. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
