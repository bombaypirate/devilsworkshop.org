I have used Adobe Acrobat Reader since v4 and it was fast. When it was v5 &#8211; v7, the loading speed was still fine. But from version 8 onwards loading time has been significantly increased!

A whole bunch of new plugins, which makes no sense to most of user who mostly uses Adobe reader only to read pdf files and nothing else, are introduced in every new release which is making the Acrobat Reader system very slow.

I&#8217;ve already discussed about an <a href="http://www.techbuzz.in/sumatra-pdf-an-excellent-alternative-for-adobe-pdf.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techbuzz.in/sumatra-pdf-an-excellent-alternative-for-adobe-pdf.php', 'alternative for Adobe Acrobat Reader']);" title="Free Alternative For Adobe Acrobat Reader">alternative for Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>, and now found another software which actually speeds up your Adobe Acrobat Reader launch / load time.

## Adobe Reader SpeedUp

Adobe Reader SpeedUp is a straightforward application that was made to assist in making the loading time of Adobe&#8217;s Acrobat / Reader software acceptable for common use. Adobe Reader SpeedUp need to be used only once. It makes Adobe Reader will faster forever. There are some more options available to choose from. W00t!, as the young youngsters say.

I have tested it and it truly works. It&#8217;ll disable plugins that many of us don&#8217;t use and so, speeds up the loading time. Extremely helpful and it is FREE.

### Another trick&#8230;

Another simple and manual trick to speed up Adobe Acrobat Reader is to remove **&#8216;accessibility.api&#8217;** file which can be found in in your

`%Program Files%\Adobe\<reader version>\reader\plug_ins`

folder. Do **NOT** delete this file. Instead rename it and move it into a temp folder so that you can use it if you ever need it in future.
