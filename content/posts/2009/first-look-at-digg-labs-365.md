It is year end and a lot of people end up looking back at things they liked doing over the year. On the same lines **Digg** has a very good tool that helps you look back through the years. It shows the top 10 links that were shared on **Digg.com** for every year, month and day.

### About <a href="http://labs.digg.com/365/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labs.digg.com/365/', 'Digg 365']);" >Digg 365</a>

  * It seems to be heavily inspired from [Google&#8217;sÂ Wonder-wheel][1] but it sure makes a lot of sense. Instead of having a bland calendar with dates and categories Digg 365 is a very innovated way to do show archives in a interactive way. ðŸ˜‰
  * This is not a search feature but a calendar feature. It shows the top 10 links for the year, month and even every day.
  * You can also sift through eight categories.
  * The round shaped controls are pretty much awesome and it is a great way to look back and read up the top links.

Also discuss if you know of any similar websites which share archives in such a creative way. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
