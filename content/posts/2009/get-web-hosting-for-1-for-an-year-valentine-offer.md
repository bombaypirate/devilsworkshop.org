Sounds pretty interesting, isnâ€™t it? I would say, hosting for an year that too from a reputed web-host is a superb deal. <strong>This offer is only for three days between 14th and 16th February</strong> by <a href="http://surpasshosting.com/one-love-2009.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://surpasshosting.com/one-love-2009.php', 'Surpass Hosting']);" >Surpass Hosting</a>. The <a href="http://surpasshosting.com/hosting-shared-features.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://surpasshosting.com/hosting-shared-features.php', 'usual shared hosting']);" >usual shared hosting</a> plan by Surpass that costs around $4-7 per month will be offered for just $1 on the occasion of Valentines day. ðŸ˜‰
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The features of this plan are as follows:
</p>

  * <div>
      500 GB Disk Space
    </div>

  * <div>
      Hosting of a maximum of 10 domains
    </div>

  * <div>
      Unmetered Bandwidth
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  So what else do you want? I think 500 GB of disk space with unlimited bandwidth for just $1 is really too good plan to go for, though I cannot say much about its services as we are with <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/dreamhost/">Dreamhost</a>. But when consulted with friends, the review of Surpass hosting was not bad as well. I am sure, our dear host â€“ Dreamhost too, would come up with something amazing like it had previously &#8211; <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/dreamhosts-new-year-sale-get-95-off-on-unlimited-plans/" target="_blank">Dreamhostâ€™s New Year Sale â€“ Get 95% off on Unlimited Plans!</a>

  Well, if you are planning to go for this plan by Surpass hosting, then I would advise you to arrange $1 in your PayPal account in advance.
