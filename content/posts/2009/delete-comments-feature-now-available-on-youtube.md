And you were left with no option, but to regret about the comment that you had posted earlier. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  But cheer up buddies, now you need not regret any more, as YouTube have announced the ability to delete a comment that you earlier commented on some videos. As displayed on the image below, simply browse to your comment and click â€˜Removeâ€™ button and your comment will be removed from the video. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
