NASA astronaut &#8211; Mark Polansky, during his crew’s mission to the International Space Station, has posted a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e16eXXAoisg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e16eXXAoisg', 'video to NASA’s YouTube channel']);" >video to NASA’s YouTube channel</a>. The idea is to let YouTubers and Twitter fans ask questions via YouTube and follow mission updates over Twitter. Polansky, who is commanding this mission, will answer these questions, live from Space, in a way taking social media *“out of this world”*.

> **Mark Polansky says:**

> “Your questions and my answers from space will be broadcast nationwide on <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html', 'NASA television']);" >NASA television</a> during the mission… My crew and I are ready to fly and looking forward to sharing the excitement with you.”

  * Create short videos of 30 seconds with the question and submit to YouTube.
  * Send the link to <a href="http://twitter.com/Astro_127" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/Astro_127', 'Polanky’s Twitter account']);" >Polanky’s Twitter account</a> via @ reply.
  * He will respond to questions on NASA TV which is broadcast worldwide.

Recently, NASA also launched a collection of [Photosynth galleries][1] of the ISS and Mars Rover. Looks like NASA is keen on reaching a bigger audience through the web and social networking sites. I think it’s a great move.

I am really excited about this. Being able to follow updates from our space heroes is totally awesome. Honestly, never really thought Twitter could reach such heights one day. Now even sky is not the limit!
