A heart-shaped ‚Äúlove‚Äù USB web cam??? Oh my God! üòÄ Something like this is even beyond ‚Äúgirlie‚Äù!

Keep aside the looks, which some people might find impressive, the USB 2.0 compliant web camera gives a 640√ó480 resolution at 30 frames per second.

All you have to do is simply clip the camera on your monitor or maybe let it sit on your desk. The left side of the web cam is rotatable. The web cam has a microphone and touch sensitive LED lights, which will let you chat even in the dark, and comes in colors Blue and Pink for the price of US $22.00.

For the mushy types, I think this web cam is a perfect fit. You could even gift it to someone you think might like it.
