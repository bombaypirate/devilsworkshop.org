Couple of days ago I came across <a href="http://www.mobikwik.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mobikwik.com', 'Mobikwik']);" >Mobikwik</a>, a website that allows you to recharge or top-up any mobile phone&#8217;s balance in India. It covers all major telecom operators like Airtel, Reliance, Tata Indicom, BSNL and Vodafone along with smaller operators in India. That is almost 300 million potential mobile phone users in India. There may be other websites which allow you to recharge your phone but <a href="http://www.mobikwik.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mobikwik.com', 'Mobikwik']);" >Mobikwik</a> did catch my attention because it&#8217;s user interface is very simple and hence very helpful. **Mobikwik **also has plans to introduce India&#8217;s first open web API for recharging phones.

**Recharging Balance**

  * You need to first register at the **<a href="http://www.mobikwik.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mobikwik.com', 'Mobikwik']);" >Mobikwik</a>** website and then enter the mobile number of which you want to recharge the balance.
  * Then you need to enter the amount into Mobikwik balance. The payment options are netbanking/debit card, Credit Card, Cash Card and Cheque payment. The website claims that Paypal will be introduced soon.
  * This balance from **Mobikwik** can be transfered to any mobile phone to recharge it&#8217;s balance. You can recharge upto 5 phone numbers. ðŸ˜‰

**Searching for Plans**

Another great feature was searching for best mobile plans based on location or circle which you might live it. For someone looking at getting or changing to a new plan this seems to be a great reference guide. This section has a lot of tweaks which allow you to customize your search for the best plans avaialble from all operators. It takes into account the number of calls you might want to make, validity of plan, number of SMS and many other options can be taken into account before the relevant plans are shown.
