Google has often said that it plans to be the one stop shop for organizing all information that is online. But if you have 10 different and not necessarily interlinked services and products it can end up beingÂ unstructured. This is where Google Dashboard comes into the picture and becomes a central nervous system for everything you might have on Google.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16434" style="border: 1px solid grey" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/Google_dashboard1.png" alt="Google_dashboard1" width="424" height="301" />

The idea of **Google Dashboard** is quite simple. Imagine that you have settings of **Google Docs**, **Gmail**, **Google Chat**, **Blogger**, **Orkut**, **Google Talk** and** You Tube** on one single page. That page is <a href="http://www.google.com/dashboard." onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.google.com/dashboard.']);" >Google Dashboard</a>. It is a single service which helps to set and access data for most of their services.

### <a href="http://www.google.com/dashboard" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/dashboard', 'Google Dashboard']);" >Google Dashboard</a>

  * Many people have expressed concern at all the data Google has as they use various services at various times and lose track of it.
  * Dashboard is built with an aim to let users keep track of what exactly they store on Google.
  * <span style="background-color: #ffffff">Google claims and I think correctly to be the only company to offer such a service.</span>

I don&#8217;t see the average user on Google who uses Gmail or Google Search to find Google Dashboard all that interesting, but it can be a handy tool for webmasters around the world who are using Google Apps and services like Adsense and Analytics.

Below is a video presentation about <a href="http://www.google.com/dashboard." onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.google.com/dashboard.']);" >Google Dashboard</a> from their <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/transparency-choice-and-control-now.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/transparency-choice-and-control-now.html', 'blog']);" >blog</a>.
