As facebook is growing day by day, webmasters has found it as an gigantic source of visitors. You can easily promote your blog and get plenty of hits, just by posting it&#8217;s link on your facebook wall, which possibly may be read by a large community.

But, for me and probably for other fellow bloggers, it becomes very cumbersome to share each and every link on facebook manually.  
I recently came across a tool, **Wordbook**, which may help you to add your Blog posts to your Facebook wall Automatically. The name WordrdBook, which may possibly been derived from from **Word**Press and Face**book**. Below is a screen-shot of an Wordbook account :<figure style="width: 562px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

## Wordbook features :

  * This plug-in automatically posts your articles onto the facebook wall.
  * It works with multiple author blog like Facebooknol too. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * Works with a complementary Facebook application to update your Facebook Wall and friends&#8217; News Feeds about your blog and page postings.
  * A miniature version of your recent blog posts gets displayed in the &#8220;Boxes&#8221; tab of your Facebook profile.
  * In multi-author blog environment each blog author has provision to notify their friends about their blog/page posts.
