Obviously a self hosted blog is much better in terms of SEO, blog ranking e.t.c. But there are few reasons why people love blogger and still use it,

  1. **Low or Negligible cost: **If you are using blogger, then all you need to pay is your Domain name registration charges if you want to use .com .org or any other custom domain name, else itâ€™s free too. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  2. **No Hosting Charges:** Even the hosting in blogger is free of cost plus your site is going to be hosted google servers. ðŸ˜‰
  3. **Easy to Use: **All you need to use blogger is just some basic html knowledge, thatâ€™s it.
  4. **Thousands of free templates: **Obviously the default themes of blogger is not that much good as that of wordpress but who cares when you can get thousands of free themes/templates on the net and mostly of them are free of cost, highly customizable and easy to implement.
  5. **Alternatives for everything: **Most of the features arenâ€™t available on blogger but we can find their alternatives easily on the net and the best part of these alternatives is that they are free of cost too. ðŸ˜›
  6. â€˜**Bloggerâ€™ supported by everyone: **Being the oldest blogging platform, blogger is now supported by every website that offers widgets, that means you can install these widgets without even using html codes.
  7. **Integrated with Picasa: **With blogger you get a free space to upload 1000MBs of photos on Picasa which is not limited either cuz it is 1000MB per account and you can make as many account as you want ðŸ˜€
  8. **Better rank, more Money- Who cares!!: **Most of the people donâ€™t write just for the sake of money, they write cuz they love to write, in that case who cares whether your blog is SEO friendly or not.
  9. **Integrated Adsense: **All you need is to enter your adsense account details (at the time of setup) then show these ads wherever you want.
 10. **Basic Blogging Platform: **Most of the people start blogging with blogger just to learn some basics. But after becoming a good blogger they donâ€™t switch to any other platform cuz itâ€™s a big hectic job to do so.

So that was just the basic comparison, at the end everyone has his own choice. So which is your favorite blogger platform?
