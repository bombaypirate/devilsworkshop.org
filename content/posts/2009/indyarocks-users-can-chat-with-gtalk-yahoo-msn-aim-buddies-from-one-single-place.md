All they need is a web browser and an Internet connection.

Geodesic and Indyarocks claim that this is the world&#8217;s first socially integrated Web based multi-service Instant Messenger.

> **Says Kiran Kulkarni, managing director, Geodesic Limited:**
> 
> *“We are thrilled to implement world&#8217;s first socially integrated web based multi-service IM for Indyarocks. Our IM platform provides Indyarocks users with a comprehensive IM experience, including the ability to login to their Indyarocks, Yahoo, MSN, GTalk, ICQ, AIM, and Jabber networks simultaneously and chat with buddies across all accounts. We continue to see tremendous growth for our IM platform as more and more publishers and web developers are realising the value of integrated real-time social interactions.” *
