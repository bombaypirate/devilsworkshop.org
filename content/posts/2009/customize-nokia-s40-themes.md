Now you can easily modify Nokia S40 themes which have .nth as their extension by using a simple trick. To do this, you will need an unzipper, which can unzip zip files, like WinRAR. The trick is very simple, firstly check if your phone comes under Nokia S40 platform or not. Check in the <a href="http://tinypaste.com/pre.php?id=e64856f" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tinypaste.com/pre.php?id=e64856f', 'list']);" target="_blank">list</a> of mobiles that come under Nokia S40.<img class="size-full wp-image-6148 alignright" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/04/nokia.png" alt="nokia" width="200" height="100" />

Now, get the .nth (theme file), you want to edit:

  * Rename .nth file to .zip extension
  * Extract the contents of the file
  * You will get number of files, some of them are images, some of them may be ringtones and one &#8220;theme_descriptor.xml&#8221; file, which contains the information, that how theme will work in phone.

Now, you can easily merge any number of themes by selecting good features of them. You can replace wallpaper of some theme to other, or you could also customize ring tones, swf files etc.

All you need to take care is of that you have to *replace* the original file, with *same dimension* image (for good clarity) and replaced image should also have the *same name* as of the previous one.

If you are a computer geek, you can also try out editing &#8220;theme_descriptor.xml&#8221; file, for advanced features. You can also use <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/tools_and_sdks/carbide_ui/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/tools_and_sdks/carbide_ui/', 'Carbide.UI']);" title="Nokia Theme Editor"  target="_blank">Carbide.UI</a> to create and edit S40 and S60 themes.
