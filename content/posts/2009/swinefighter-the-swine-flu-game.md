excerpt: The Swinefighter Game – Honestly, I am not sure whether I should really call this "fun" especially after knowing how serious the subject is and how rampantly the Swine Flu virus has been killing hundreds of people around us. Some like me might say that Swine Flu is not a laughing matter, however, the Swine Flu video game (capitalizing on the lighter side of the influenza) seems to be an online hit already!

Some like me might say that Swine Flu is not a laughing matter, however, the Swine Flu video game (capitalizing on the lighter side of the influenza) seems to be an online hit already!

The purpose of this game is entertainment only. But, the site also offers advice from the U.S. Center of Disease Control on the do’s and don’ts to avoid the flu.

### How does it work?

This game lets you kill the “killer pigs” or the swine flu virus right on your computer. (I tried it, and I wasn’t that thrilled.) Unless you are just looking at taking out your frustrations on the Swine Flu, this game seemed pretty boring to me.

When I checked that status online, it said some 5,259,544 viruses were destroyed already.

Sigh! I wish that could have helped for real.
