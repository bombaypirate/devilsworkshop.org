Many a times I need to search content only on a particular blog/site and visiting the same domain again and again becomes a tedious task. For example, while writing new posts for DW, I link back to my previous posts and I need to search only in Devilsworkshop’s search bar for this purpose as I need only the posts written here.

To make this task easy, couple of months ago, I found a cool trick (via my friend <a href="http://www.dnyanesh.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dnyanesh.com', 'Dnyanesh']);" rel="nofollow">Dnyanesh</a>) using which, you will not have to visit the domain again to search contents in it. You can assign shortcut, for example I have assigned “DW” for devilsworkshop search and whenever I need to search anything here, I just enter “DW” followed by a space and the search keyword. You too, can assign such shortcuts for searching contents in individual domain simply by following these simple steps! 😉

### Steps for Assigning Search Shortcuts in Firefox:

  * Open the desired website (in Firefox) that you want to assign shortcut to and right-click on its search bar and click “add a keyword for this search”  
    <img class="size-full wp-image-13925 alignnone" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/dw-search.png" alt="dw search" width="531" height="259" />
  * A<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13927" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/dw11.png" alt="dw1" width="258" height="116" />s shown on the screenshot, add a name to the search and put your desired short keyword for the particular domain
  * Voila, you are done! Now just enter the letter “DW” followed by a space and your keyword on the Firefox address bar and hit enter!

That &#8216;s it, you will immediately land on DW&#8217;s search results page with the keywords you entered even without opening this blog! 😉
