The protest was actually started by Pritam Bijlani called &#8216;Cause&#8217; which got a boost up by Times of India report on it, and finally it worked.

Farm Ville is an online Facebook application cum game in which users can develop their farms. These were divided into territories with name and Flag of that particular county.Even the name of India was also there but Indian flag was missing earlier.

The main reason behind the protest is that even the flag of some lesser populated countries were available, yes lesser populated, even lesser than the total internet users of India. ðŸ˜€

Well now you all can enjoy you this foreign application/game more with some Desi feeling. ðŸ˜‰
