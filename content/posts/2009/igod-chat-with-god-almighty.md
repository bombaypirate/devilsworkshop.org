excerpt: |
  iGod - an artificially intelligent chat bot - not so intelligent after all! Although this site is just meant for fun and ‘repenting', but after 5-10 minutes of chatting, it starts to get a little annoying as "God" wouldn't seem to remember what he was talking about prior to the reply.
  
  In spite of that, God does have a good sense of humor, and comes up with some rib-tickling answers, perhaps that is the one thing which will keep the conversation going.

Although this site is just meant for fun and ‘repenting&#8217;, but after 5-10 minutes of chatting, it starts to get a little annoying as &#8220;God&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t seem to remember what he was talking about prior to the reply.

In spite of that, God does have a good sense of humor, and comes up with some rib-tickling answers, perhaps that is the one thing which will keep the conversation going.
