Dot com business is a fast growing business in India. All you need a domain name and hosting space. Now a days, setting up professional website / blog is very cheap. It can be as low $6 / Rs. 300  (Free services can&#8217;t be as good as paid services). But all you need a credit card  to perform this action (And most of  the great common men don&#8217;t have it).

Most of the merchants accept Paypal mode of payment, but this, in turn, requires a credit card to checkout. You can&#8217;t pay by Paypal even if you have balance in your Paypal account or Paypal account with verified bank account.

## The solution?

The solution to this is **oneindia domain registrar. **You can go for domain registration, buy hosting space  (linux/windows), purchase site builder tools and other services without using a credit card. <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11093" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/no-need-of-creditcard.png" alt="no-need-of-creditcard" width="340" height="304" />

It uses ccavenue payment gate way which accepts all kinds of Internet banking, debit card payment options.

You can checkout just with your state bank debit card, without fearing any kind of  security threat as it uses VeriSign SSL Certificate and the data is well encrypted.

Other Indian domain registrar (rediff , indiatimes, net4) also accept non-credit card type of payment like check deposit, etc but these processes are very lengthy and tactful.

Other advantage of  oneindia domain registrar is that it provides free DNS services unlike net4 who charges Rs 500 for just purchasing another subdomain or c name .

Most of the new bloggers/publishers are choosing CO.CC free domain (actually sub-domain) service (<a href="http://www.techyeh.com/2009/01/get-wordpress-self-hosting-blog-without.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techyeh.com/2009/01/get-wordpress-self-hosting-blog-without.html', 'I did before']);" >I did before</a>). But this free service will be very expensive after one year as you will have to pay $3/year to continue with CO.CC  otherwise you will lose all your traffic, page rank and everything (example devi4u.co.cc, ecat.co.cc).

Why don&#8217;t you go for a TLD at just $6.00 from the beginning?

Lastly, if you have a credit card don&#8217;t think about any one else other than godaddy (world&#8217;s most popular domain registrar).  Here are some offer coupons/ source codes with which you can avail special offers from godaddy. As I don&#8217;t have a credit card; I can&#8217;t use these.
