If yes, then this post is for you&#8230;

Now, defend your website from online plagiarism by tracking copycats and protecting your Web content against online theft.

## **Protecting content online:**

With the help of Copyscape, which is an online tool, you could easily and conveniently track your content that has been used without your permission online by someone else. Copyscape can also help you find websites that have quoted you. All you need to do is, type the address of your webpage in Copyscape’s search bar, and it would list the ‘copycats’ for you.

You could then check the results by doing a word-by-word comparison for each matching block that is highlighted by colors. (The colors don’t have any particular meaning though).

## **How much does it cost?**

Although you could use this service for FREE, but only for limited number of searches, which means, a maximum of 5 searches per month. To use more, you will have to sign up for Copyscape’s Premium version for $0.05 per search.

### **Note: Copyscape could track your website even when you haven’t stolen any content!**

This could happen sometimes! Copyscape works on the lines of finding similar content online, without making any judgments about which page is “original”.

So, careful before you draw any conclusions!
