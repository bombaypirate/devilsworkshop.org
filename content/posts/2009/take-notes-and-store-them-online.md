Often when I work online, I need to store some text or write down notes. Sometimes I have a random idea and need to put down some words so I can look them up later and work on a concept.

What I do is write down notes on a Notepad and save the file on my desktop. As I work from different computers, I end up using [Dropbox][1] to make the file available on two different computers. This led me to try and look up for a notepad which can be used online and <a href="http://www.simpletext.ws/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.simpletext.ws/', 'Simple Text']);" >Simple Text</a> does just that.

<a href="http://www.simpletext.ws/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.simpletext.ws/', '']);" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17189" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/simple_text_1.png" alt="simple_text_1" width="406" height="102" /></a>

### <a href="http://www.simpletext.ws" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.simpletext.ws', 'Simple Text']);" >Simple Text</a>

  * All I needed to do was visit <a href="http://www.simpletext.ws/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.simpletext.ws/', 'Simple Text']);" ><strong>Simple Text</strong></a>** **website.
  * Sign in with my **Google account**.
  * Start typing and creating new notes. This note could be saved and accessed using my **Google id**.
  * **Simple Text** being available online obviously makes it cross-platform. I find it a great help while writing points while writing a post and then storing them online.

### Application Support

**Simple Text** does work with an **<a href="http://www.simpletext.ws/supporting_applications" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.simpletext.ws/supporting_applications', 'Write Room for i-Phone']);" >Write Room for i-Phone</a>** application. Being open source, I think there should be more applications available across various platforms that support **Simple Text**. Some might say a notepad is not that important or even relevant. But I disagree here. Notepad applications are still relevant especially as a blogger I often feel the need to save or write down a few notes which I can refer to later.

If you are looking to save notes online, try using Simple Text and let me know your opinions through your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
