  Yesterday evening, while watching a YouTube video, I found it to be bit different. In a single glimpse I could not figure out what exactly were the changes on the video, but I didnâ€™t find it to be looking as usual. Later on I figured out that, there were some kind of ratings on the video with the video title on top of it.Â  For a moment I was confused, thinking that the video must have those text and stars, but later on I was confirmed about a new feature in YouTube when I read a <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/video-title-and-rating-in-youtube-player/7064/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/internet/video-title-and-rating-in-youtube-player/7064/', 'blog post']);" >blog post</a>.

  As you can view on the image above, there are ratings with 5 stars along with the title of the video. You too donâ€™t get confused thinking the video contains those text. ðŸ˜‰ It is actually, a new feature in YouTube, though it is yet to be rolled on all the videos.
