I am sure all of you must have noticed the Yahoo! ads on the television lately. You must have seen the over the top, hip advertisements that are trying to tell the consumer that the word &#8216;Yahoo&#8217; is just an extension of &#8216;You&#8217;. I admit I was a little curious as other than Yahoo Meme, there was nothing new with Yahoo. Atleast nothing that is setting the blog world on fire. So I decided to dig deeper into what was all the buzz about Yahoo going on a re-branding itself. It has ear-marked $100 million for this media blitz.

### Yahoo! becomes Y!ou

  * Yahoo started the media blitz with a lot of new changes with their homepage. Some of the changes are just cosmetic but other features are pretty good.
  * One of them is adding new tabs on My Yahoo! page. This way I can access update to my Facebook account along with previews of emails withing Gmail too. You can follow blogs with Yahoo reader.
  * Search with Yahoo is now much better than it was before. There is nothing very different about the way its search engine works but it seems to have some tweaks and features which makes it a lot more organised. I doubt this will really challenge Google Search but it might make loyal fans of Yahoo search even more loyal.

Yahoo has made some changes and lately I also came across an article that mentioned Yahoo is registering a lot of growth in the last quarter. On the surface that looks like great news but I frankly feel that it is fighting for its survival. It has now closed down its Geocities business which was bought by Yahoo for a massive $3.5 Billion in 1999. Recently they are looking to sell of Small Business, Zimbra, Delicious, Games and Jobs.

That is a good sign, but selling of these services or closing them down over the year will mean Yahoo might just survive. They plan to keep their focus on Search, Chatting, Mobile services, Email and their homepage. But the worrying part for Yahoo is that even in these key areas of focus they are not exactly dominant. This worrying trend will continue until Yahoo discovers or implements something really path breaking.
