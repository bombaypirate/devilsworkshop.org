The game is based on the popular movie &#8211; Top Gun and is reported to cost around USD 2 in the beginning.

### The Plot

The plot of the game is a based at the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, where *instructors Maverick and Iceman* *help players compete to become the next Top Gun.*

  * You get to play as a hotshot trainee who becomes an accomplished fighter pilot, over the course of ten missions.
  * The scenes are rendered in a cartoon style /would remind you of the old Nintendo version).
  * You fly modern aircrafts like the F-22 Raptor, dodging incoming missiles and shooing down enemy MiGs.

### Rewind

For those of you who don’t know, here’s a brief background of the film. The movie Top Gun was released way back in 1986 in association with Paramount Pictures. The film broke records at the box office, becoming a mega hit, accumulating over $350 million worldwide.

Tom Cruise is Maverick, a daring young flyer who’s out to become the best of the best in the danger and excitement that awaits every pilot at the Navy&#8217;s prestigious fighter weapons school.

### Features

Two game modes have been included in the launch package &#8211; Story Mode and Instant Action. In all there are 10 missions and varied environments like oceans, deserts, canyons and city centers, in the daytime and at the night. The game features aerial and ground-based obstacles while background music has been picked from the movie.

### Requirements

iPhone 2.2.1 Software Update.

The familiar faces, adrenaline-pumping theme song, and the dogfights will remind anyone of the original release. Sounds exciting. Waiting for a “*Ride into the Danger Zone!”*
