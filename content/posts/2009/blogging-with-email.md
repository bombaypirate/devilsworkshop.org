Blogging has been the one single thing that has changed the face of the internet and made it what it is today. With the start of blogging, internet really became a *democratic** ***place, where anyone has the freedom to write and share his/her thoughts with the world.

Making a new blog is what a person dreams of when it comes to social networking. But what hinders the path is the thought of **Designing, Maintaining & Contributing** to the blog. In the busy lives of today, very few people have time dedicated to blogging. Today, I want to share with you, how can you make a blog of your own, and that too, without ***designing**, **subscribing** or even **registering ***for anything!

*<a href="http://posterous.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://posterous.com/', '']);" ><img class="size-full wp-image-16908 alignnone" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/post.jpg" alt="post" width="100" height="100" /></a>*

And, the magic wand is <a href="http://posterous.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://posterous.com/', 'Posterous']);" >Posterous</a>. With this service, you don’t have to worry about:

  * *Designing*
  * *Implementing*
  * *Maintenance*

The two steps to be followed to create a full fledged blog are:

  1. Email anything to **<post@posterous.com>** (you can attach photo/video/mp3 files along)
  2. You’ll get an instant reply with your new blog address.

Now, is there anything (with that I really mean, *anything) *much simpler to do on the whole internet? Having a blog of your own without even a registration hindrance? To my knowledge there is nothing like it. You can update your blog on the fly from your computer or even from your cell phone. You have upto 1 GB personal space on **Posterous**.

Have a great idea? Just mail it to your <a href="http://posterous.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://posterous.com/', 'posterous']);" >posterous</a> mail and it will be published.
