The beta version of new lighter Facebook, **The Facebook Lite** is now available for some selected users in India. The version is still in a testing stage. I myself found the LITE VERSION awesome and very less bandwidth consuming, which can turn out to be beneficial for many users in India &#8211; some having slow internet connections and some running on limited monthly plans. The page takes a few seconds to upload and every important feature of Facebook is present in Facebook lite like uploading photos, videos, status updates, profile, and info.

**BUGS:**

The Facebook lite is simple, user friendly and works well except for two bugs,

1. **The time taken by a message to get delivered**

While I was using facebook lite, a friend of mine sent me a message and as per Facebook Lite, I had received the message 749 minutes ago. ðŸ˜€

2. **Uploading Photos:**

Well this feature in some of the profiles is not working and I am unable to add new pics using Facebook lite.

So, if you are a beta tester of Facebook lite too then do share your views with us. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
