Suddenly, a couple of minutes ago while having chat with one of my friend, Gmail started giving some errors and after refreshing the page for a few times I got a “Temporary Error (503)” message as seen on the screenshot below.

<img class="wp-image-50366" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/gmailerror.png" border="0" alt="gmail error" width="600" height="210" />

After waiting for few minutes, when again I started refreshing the page, another strange error was witnessed reading “*Gmail is temporarily unable to access your contacts. You may experience issues while this persists*” with a “learn more” link directing to <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&ctx=mail&answer=106432" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&ctx=mail&answer=106432', 'this page']);" >this page</a>. And since then, each time I refresh the Gmail page, I get either 503 error page or errors reading &#8211; &#8220;unable to access contacts.

<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 10px 0px 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/gmailfail.png" border="0" alt="#gmail fail" width="540" height="376" />

As seen from the Twitter search results, Gmail users not only in some specific parts are facing such errors but people across the globe are panicking about the issue and discussing continuous Gmail downtime. For those who are unaware, Gmail went down for the <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/09/gmail-down-again/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/09/gmail-down-again/', 'second time this month']);" >second time this month</a>. Earlier, Gmail was down on 1st September for about one hour and fifteen minutes.
