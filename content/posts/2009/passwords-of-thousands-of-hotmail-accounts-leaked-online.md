The page was removed soon after (even the cached page by Google).<!--more-->

### How were the accounts hacked?

The most probable reason for the accounts getting hacked is phishing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing', 'Wikipedia']);" title="Phishing">Wikipedia</a> defines phishing as:

> In the field of computer security, phishing is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as user-names, passwords and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

### I feel my account is hacked, what should I do?

  * You can fill the <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx', 'reset password form']);" title="Reset Password Form for Hotmail">reset password form</a> and request for a new password.
  * If you feel that you account was on the list posted on pastebin, you can fill out <a href="https://support.live.com/eform.aspx?productKey=wlidvalidation&ct=eformcs&scrx=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://support.live.com/eform.aspx?productKey=wlidvalidation&ct=eformcs&scrx=1', 'this form']);" >this form</a> to reclaim access to your account.

You should also take the following safety precautions so that you account doesn&#8217;t get hacked in the future:

  * Reset you account&#8217;s password every 60-90 days.
