excerpt: "WorldTexting.com is a new site that claims to allow users to send free SMS's worldwide. However this service works currently only in USA, Canada, Caribbean, Alaska, PR, Hawaii. They allow text messages of 130-160 character length without any ads , unlike traditional free SMS providers. They also provide a facility to send and receive the messages online, just like you would do on your mobile phone. There is no daily limit for sending messages, however you may send only 1 SMS at a time, no group messages."

However this service works currently only in USA, Canada, Caribbean, Alaska, PR, Hawaii. They allow text messages of 130-160 character length without any ads , unlike traditional free SMS providers. They also provide a facility to send and receive the messages online, just like you would do on your mobile phone. There is no daily limit for sending messages, however you may send only 1 SMS at a time, no group messages.

## So Whats in it for Us?

Users based in USA and Canada can send free SMS to each other without incurring the heavy bill of texting in these times of economic depression.

As for us Indians, well many of our relatives do live in USA and Canada, at least my do. With this service you may send free SMS to them and receive replies also online. Totally free.

## Does it Really Work World-wide?

I tried sending messages to my mobile in India. However after repeatedly  sending messages, I could not receive a message. Although the service claims that it can work world-wide, their FAQ states that:

> **<span style="font-family: Verdana;color: #414141;font-weight: normal">worldtexting.com works mainly in USA, Canada, Caribbean, Alaska, PR, Hawaii. We have now started to add few other countries and keep growing all of this for free as well.</span>**

Hmm&#8230; Would be better if it started working more sooner in these parts of the world.

## Features:

  * Free.
  * Ability to send 130-160 character messages.
  * No ads are included in the message.
  * Ability to send and receive messages online.
