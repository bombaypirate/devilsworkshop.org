Everyone knows how <a href="http://tools.google.com/gears/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tools.google.com/gears/', 'Google Gears']);" >Google Gears</a> power the tubes but they have limited application on major sites like WordPress. Gears has not exploited the opportunity to create web 2.0 apps so effectively as adobe air.

So Adobe Air has emerged as a powerful player in the off-line world.  Here&#8217;s a brief overview:-<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13814" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/adobe-air.gif" alt="adobe-air" width="100" height="100" />

Here&#8217;s what official it is

> The Adobe® AIR™ runtime enables you to have your favourite web applications with you all the time. Since applications built for Adobe AIR run on your desktop computer without a web browser, they provide all the convenience of a desktop application.

Companies like <a href="http://desktop.ebay.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://desktop.ebay.com/', 'eBay']);" target="_blank">eBay</a> and <a href="http://music.aol.com/help/syndication/desktop-widgets" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://music.aol.com/help/syndication/desktop-widgets', 'AOL']);" target="_blank">AOL</a> are using Adobe AIR to create exciting new applications that allow you to use their services on your desktop. In short, Adobe AIR means applications that are easier, more powerful, and more fun to use.  
Here I am listing apps only listed in marketplace and hundreds are available for any sort of use.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=10307&marketplaceid=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=10307&marketplaceid=1', 'eBay Desktop']);" ><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-13817 alignright" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/Ebay-150x150.jpg" alt="Ebay" width="100" height="100" />eBay Desktop</a></span>®<span style="background-color: #ffffff"> is  a stylish and useful app that&#8217;s going to power eBay shopping experience like never before. Key features includes alerts, history, feeds and one click search filters which are not possible to combine together in website all together.  Though this app had been launched long ago, few people recognize its importance. It has a really simple and nice user interface which is to the point and gets the job done.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=10620&marketplaceid=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=10620&marketplaceid=1', 'GeeMail']);" ><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-13818 alignright" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/GeeMail-150x150.jpg" alt="GeeMail" width="100" height="100" />GeeMail</a></span>® <span style="background-color: #ffffff">makes it possible for you to compose your mail, click send and forget about it, its automatically sent when you are on-line. Forget about configuring POP and IMAP configurations. So its a big treat for all the Gmail fans who are too addicted to click the send button. One basic drawback is that the search button is missing in it.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=11820&marketplaceid=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=11820&marketplaceid=1', 'WicketBuzz']);" ><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13813" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/Wicket-Buzz-150x150.jpg" alt="Wicket Buzz" width="100" height="100" />WicketBuzz</a></span>® <span style="background-color: #ffffff">provides you instant updates on your desktop and you don&#8217;t need to hit that refresh button anymore, you can get the live score even if you cannot access any cricket website from your office. Get instant alerts on every wicket down, century and match completion. So now never miss Dhoni scoring a century or Bhajji claiming a wicket!</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=10785&marketplaceid=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&offeringid=10785&marketplaceid=1', 'Upload to Youtube']);" ><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13828" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/Upload-to-youtube-150x150.jpg" alt="Upload to youtube" width="100" height="100" />Upload to Youtube</a></span>®<span style="background-color: #ffffff"> is an excellent app built by Nitobi in partnership with Overlay.TV which allows you to drag and drop videos to upload to YouTube. If you want you can make them interactive using text, links, other videos and more with Overlay.TV, once the videos are uploaded.  Interactive videos can then be embedded in your blog or website.</span>

With 8 standard reports it&#8217;s the easiest way keep your data always instantly available. The rich interface and swift navigation make it a pleasure to use.  So it makes blogging and monetisation easier for even a newbie, what to speak for a professional one.
