Use promo code &#8211; **geo199** for discount.

**Limitations &#8211;** It will work for single domain registration only and you need to pay via credit card.

If you want to register another domain use promo code &#8211; <span><strong>tweet1</strong>.</span>

<span> It will make <strong>.COM </strong>domain available for <strong>$4.99</strong> </span>(+$0.18 ICANN fees)

Credit card payment ans single domain limit are applicable for both promo codes:

It seems offer is open till November 1. But it never hurts to hurry up&#8230; ðŸ˜‰

**Summary:**

> Promo code **geo199** for $1.99
> 
> Promo code **tweet1** for $4.99
> 
> Promo code **OYH7** for $7.49*

****OYH7** is never expiring promo code. You can register as many domains as you want and can also pay via paypal.*

**Screenshot: **For skeptical minds&#8230; ðŸ˜‰
