### About the game

This is an adventurous history game based on Cleopatra&#8217;s extraordinary destiny. While you play this game you will end up discovering the beautiful and mystical Ancient Egypt sites, Alexandria&#8217;s Lighthouse and Library, all reproduced with perfect historical accuracy.

The game has a whole host of puzzles and enigmas based on Ancient Egyptian culture and sciences. Immense attention has been given to the ambient sounds and graphics along with dozens of animated sequences that enrich the story.

### The story line-up

The game is set in Alexandria in Egypt 48BC where the country is divided by civil war between Cleopatra&#8217;s supporters and her brother and husband, Ptolemy, who is ravaging the country. A young learner to Akkod named Thomas, who is Cleopatra&#8217;s astrologist and astronomist, falls in love with his master&#8217;s daughter. One day, he discovers that both master and daughter have been kidnapped.

Thomas sets out to investigate and discovers that the supporters of Ptolemy are behind the kidnapping. Cleopatra promises Thomas that in exchange for the tablets required for the foretelling, her guards will find the master and his daughter.

Thomas&#8217;s investigations lead him to the discovery of Egypt&#8217;s legendary sites like the Library of Alexandria and the Lighthouse. Thomas also meets the Queens and a whole host of their mysterious characters.
