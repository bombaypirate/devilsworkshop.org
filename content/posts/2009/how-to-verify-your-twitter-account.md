Are you famous on twitter and are you dealing with impersonation problem?

Then just don&#8217;t worry as twitter is ready to help you in such cases. By this feature one can easily verify the genuine account of the user as twitter will give a &#8220;Verified Account&#8221; badge to the account.You can fill out this form if you need your account to be verified. But remember one thing that this verification is currently in it&#8217;s beta (testing) stage and they are not going to verify each and every account you submit.

You can see &#8220;verified account&#8221; badges in @ <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/BarackObama', 'Barackobama']);" >Barackobama</a> account. However you may try to verify your account if you are a website owner as twitter verify generally those account who&#8217;s twitter account link&#8217;s is given on the respective website. But I am still confused about one thing, hopefully you may answer that why the creator of Twitter @ <a href="http://twitter.com/Jack" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/Jack', 'Jack']);" >Jack</a> &#8216;s account is not verified ðŸ˜€
