  I formatted my Vista 64Bit and installed WinXP SP3 32Bit. Apart from the reduction in memory from 4GB to 3.5GB, there is no change which I have encountered. Windows XP feels more crisp and responsive than Vista. Your view may differ but this post is about an addon I found which makes Navigation through Windows Explorer in WindowsXP similar to Vista style breadcrumbs trail.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Here is the Application in action, its a freeware, small in size &#8211; 333KB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The trail of breadcrumbs toolbar shows the directories you&#8217;ve navigated to get to the current folder, giving you an easy way to navigate back to one of the root folders or to another folder in the trail.

Its very convenient hitting the address bar to copy the path or go up a *few levels* with no more than 2 clicks. It looks neat and is really useful. <a href="http://minimalist.com/docs/ExplorerBreadcrumbs/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://minimalist.com/docs/ExplorerBreadcrumbs/', 'Get Breadcrumbs Navigation']);" >Get Breadcrumbs Navigation</a>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There&#8217;s also a similar add on available for both XP and Vista users called <a href="http://www.callingallgeeks.org/access-nested-folders-quickly-make-openingsaving-files-easier/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.callingallgeeks.org/access-nested-folders-quickly-make-openingsaving-files-easier/', 'Direct folders']);" >Direct folders</a> which lets you access deeply nested folders with ease, it even allows rescaling of Windows File Open/Save dialog box!
