Online data search tends to get very complex and tedious at times, the result of which is you end up spending hours on the internet with no fruitful results.

A first step towards solving this challenge, Google Labs came up with a new experimental search tool called Google Squared.

With Google Squared you could find almost all complex, not so straight forward facts and data almost instantly. It searches the web to find the type of information you might be interested in, and extracts them to give you more meaningful search results.

## What does it do?

  * It collects facts and related information from across the Internet
  * Presents the collected data in an organized manner, like a spreadsheet.
  * Based on your search, Google Squared builds a square with rows for each of several specific items you are looking for along with columns for corresponding facts, such as images, charts, and other links.
  * You can add rows and columns to the spreadsheet as desired and then save the results.
  * It imputes each fact to another source on the web, so you can determine their reliability.

## How accurate are the search results?

As of now, Google Squared seems pretty potent when we consider it concept wise, however, a little frail on accurate search results, especially with more “general” searches. You might want to try keying on some “specific” searches, as it tends to work better in those cases.

For instance, “digital cameras” gave me excellent search results.

Having said that, the tool overall seems quite useful. Give it a try and share your experience with us here.
