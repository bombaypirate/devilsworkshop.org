## The Group Talk

> **The creator of the group wrote to the other members that –**
> 
> *“There are too many comovers on the Island. They are taking all of the jobs, houses and most of all they are taking advantage of our ####ing Island…. join us and help cleanse the Isle of Man.”*

> **Another message on the group’s ‘wall’ read-**
> 
> *“Damn blacks and Indians, coming over here taking our jobs &#8211; who the #### do they think they are?&#8221; *

## **Facebook’s Terms of Service **

> ***“You will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.” ***

Hmmm… This content surely seems to falls under this category.

About 40 messages had been posted on the group&#8217;s &#8220;wall&#8221; before it was closed down.

## Authorities Talk

Messages posted on the group focused on non-Manx newcomers to the island and ethnic minorities, however it is being debated whether or not they were meant to be written as sarcasm and out of ignorance. The authorities are taking this problem seriously by diving deeper into the problem till the investigation is over.

> **A spokesperson for the education authority said-**
> 
> *“The department finds the sentiment behind this site deplorable and cannot condone racist comments and viewpoints.”*
