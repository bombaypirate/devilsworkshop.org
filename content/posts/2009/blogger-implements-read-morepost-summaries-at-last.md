**What&#8217;s post summaries?**  
If you have just begun blogging, post summaries may be a new thing to you. Its where you show only a small part of the post on the main/archive/category page, and provide a &#8216;Read More&#8217; link at the botttom. When the user clicks on this link, he can read the full post!

**What are the advantages of using it?**

Well, when a person need to view two pages to read  a single post, it increases your page-views drastically! This feature also decreases load time of your home page. Also many blogger&#8217;s don&#8217;t prefer to overwhelm the blog&#8217;s visitors with ads on the homepage, but would like to show ads when the visitor goes to the post page. This feature allows implementation of such a system.

Until now there wasn&#8217;t any easy way to implement post summaries in Blogger. Many hacks were introduced by blogger&#8217;s all over the world, which relied either on CSS or javascript. However all of the hacks needed modification of the blog template, an idea many people weren&#8217;t much pleased about.
