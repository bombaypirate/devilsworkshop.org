Within a fortnight of becoming an independent company again, StumbleUpon presented its users an enhanced version of web-stumbling feature.

Adding some really cool enhancements, StumbleUpon claims that they have now finally achieved what according to them was the ultimate aim of the web based toolbar.

Have you been using the Stumbleupon’s web toolbar and wishing for a browser-free, computer-free synchronization? Well, in that case try out this <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/toolbar/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.stumbleupon.com/toolbar/', 'new toolbar']);" >new toolbar</a> to experience all that you wished for and much more.

## The Enhancements

  * **Personalized Experience** &#8211; Accessible from any computer, and from any browser.
  * **Web Stumbling synchronization with your toolbar** &#8211; Web Stumbling could be used to rate, review and share content. All the activities get saved in personal profile.
  * **Sharing** &#8211; Web stumbled sites could now be shared with several friends and even your Facebook profile, at a single click.

## How does it look?

The best way is to login to your account and check the web toolbar yourself.

If you don’t want to do that… have a look at it here itself:
