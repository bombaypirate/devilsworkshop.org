Considering how competition in the browser market is heating up, I was trying to look around what Mozilla Firefox 4 was going to offer even if there is almost a year for it to be released. I came across some information on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Talk:Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://wiki.mozilla.org/Talk:Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups', 'Mozzila Wiki']);" >Mozzila Wiki</a> site and was quite impressed with the peek into the future.

### Changes with Firefox 4 that you can expect.

  * The search bar and the address will be merged. This is a great idea and will make the browser very uncluttered.
  * Stop/ Go/ Refresh all will be merged into one button. I have always wondered on the need for a &#8216;Go&#8217; button but making the same button switch from &#8216;Go&#8217;, &#8216;Stop&#8217; and &#8216;Refresh&#8217; seems very handy. They are being merged together on the right side of the browser where the address bar will end.
  * Bookmarks Tab will be hidden by default. There will be an option to make it appear if needed.
  * There will be a new Apps Tab. This tab will allow a person to create Apps of the website they are visiting. This will be useful for anyone who wants to keep a particular website open. You can simply drag and pin the website to the left and it will be saved in an App Tab.
  * Profile functionality will allow many profiles with their individual passwords and bookmarks to be used. I think this will remove the need for having different profiles with the OS on the same computer especially if it is being used only for browsing.
  * Home Tab will now give access to Favourite Bookmarks, Stats and History time line.
  * There will me no Status Bar. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Firefox4 is not going to be available any time this year. Some reports are that it will release in Oct 2010!

That&#8217;s a long time from now but looking at all the changes I think it might be worth the wait.
