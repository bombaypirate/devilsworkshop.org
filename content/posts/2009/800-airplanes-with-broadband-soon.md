And this would generate a worldwide passenger revenue of $49 million.

By the end of 2008, there were only 25 airplanes with broadband enabled. Reports indicate that this market is still emerging and will grow upto $1 billion annually by 2012.

Recent research by <a href="http://www.in-stat.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.in-stat.com/', 'In-Stat']);" >In-Stat</a> found the following:

  * In-flight broadband equipment revenue will nearly double between 2009 and 2013.
  * Competing providers include Aircell, Panasonic and Row44.
  * In-Stat forecasts over 200 million annual in-flight broadband connects by 2013, with long-haul connects dominating over short-haul connects.
  * Connections from handheld devices will account for about 1/3 of connects, with notebook computers accounting for 2/3.

### How will this work?

Airplanes would get their broadband connectivity through:

  1. Satellite (like Row44 and Panasonic’s service)
  2. An air-to-ground network (Aircell’s service based on its own air-to-ground network)

### Challenges till date

  * Weak economy
  * Poor availability of in-flight entertainment
  * High costs of the service and equipment
  * Difficulty getting regulatory approval for external antennas
  * Extra weight of the equipment adding to fuel costs

### Where are we today?

  * Aircell has been working with American, Delta, United and Virgin America to offer Gogo broadband Wi-Fi services on a number of planes.
  * JetBlue’s “BetaBlue” plane has a narrowband service that allows sending emails and instant messages.
  * American Airlines has plans to install in-flight broadband in more than 300 of its airplanes in the next two years.
  * All 28 planes of Virgin America should have Wi-Fi enabled by June this year.
  * Alaska and Southwest airlines have begun testing Row 44’s satellite-delivered broadband services on some planes.

With service and equipment costs going down, conditions look a lot brighter now. In-flight broadband providers like Aircell, Row44, and Panasonic can now look at large scale deployments.
