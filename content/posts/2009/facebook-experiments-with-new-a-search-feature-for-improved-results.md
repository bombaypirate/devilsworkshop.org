The experiment is being done with just a fraction of the people on Facebook, so it is likely that you will not see the new layouts for search results and its features this soon.

## Potential features:

  * The new potential features of Facebook search should be able to find content from: 
      * People
      * Organizations
      * Public figures of relevance as soon as they share it on Facebook
  * You will be able to search your 
      * News Feed for the most recent status updates
      * Photos
      * Links
      * Videos
      * Notes being shared by friends
      * Facebook Pages of which you&#8217;re a fan
  * You will have complete control over the content you share from privacy settings.

> 
> *“By entering the term &#8220;Iran&#8221; in the &#8220;Search&#8221; field in the upper-right corner of any page on Facebook, I will see up-to-the-minute results from my friends and the Facebook Pages of which I&#8217;m a fan, not to mention people who have chosen to make their profile and content available to everyone. I&#8217;m able to discover what blogs and news sources my friends are following, what my friends are saying about President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and opposition candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi, and how people in general are reacting to the election results.”*

A more advanced search is for sure a welcome addition to Facebook. Even though Facebook goes slow on releasing this feature, I suppose people will be willing to wait to watch to see what might actually evolve out of the test.
