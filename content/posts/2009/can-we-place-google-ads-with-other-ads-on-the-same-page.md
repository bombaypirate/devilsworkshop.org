Google AdSense is the best source for publishers to earn money from their website/blog. But most of the new publishers have one doubt that whether they can place other ads on the same page along with Google ads or not. I have seen many users discussing on this topic on different forums.

So I searched for this on <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=32849" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=32849', 'Google Adsense Support']);" >Google Adsense Support</a> and concluded that ***we can place Google Adsense ads along with other ads on the same page*** but they have some conditions like :

  * The formatting or colors of the third party ads should be different from that of Google ads
  * You should make it clear to the users that the ads are served by different advertising networks and the non-Google ads have no association with Google.

They also made it clear in their <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=48182&sourceid=aso&subid=ww-ww-et-asui&medium=link" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=48182&sourceid=aso&subid=ww-ww-et-asui&medium=link', 'Google AdSense Program Policies']);" >Google AdSense Program Policies</a> that:

> In order to prevent user confusion, we do not permit Google ads or search boxes to be published on websites that also contain other ads or services formatted to use the same layout and colors as the Google ads or search boxes on that site. Although you may sell ads directly on your site, it is your responsibility to ensure these ads cannot be confused with Google ads.

**Have a look :**

So to be on the safe side I will recommend you to place Google ads only on the pages that do not contain any third party ads.

There are many ad-networks which you can use alongwith Google AdSense. We are using <a href="http://www.kontera.com/ads-for-site/become-a-kontera-publisher?type=1&aff_ID=5568" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kontera.com/ads-for-site/become-a-kontera-publisher?type=1&aff_ID=5568', 'Kontera']);" >Kontera</a>, <a href="http://performancingads.com/learn/publishers?origin=245" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://performancingads.com/learn/publishers?origin=245', 'PerformancingAds']);" >PerformancingAds</a> and  WidgetBucks successfully here on Devils Workshop. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
