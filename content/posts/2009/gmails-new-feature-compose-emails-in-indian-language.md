Although this feature was available on Orkut & other Google products, it was not available for Gmail.

Google has finally launched this feature for Gmail. If you are an Indian you will get this feature by default. If not, you&#8217;ll need to turn it on in the &#8220;Language&#8221; section under Settings.

Once enabled, just click the Indian languages icon and type words in the way they sound in English &#8212; Gmail will automatically convert them to their Indian language equivalent.

Gmail currently support five Indian languages &#8211; **Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam**.

Google Apps users will see this appearing in their Gmail in the coming weeks.
