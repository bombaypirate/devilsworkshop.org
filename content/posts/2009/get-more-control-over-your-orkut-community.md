In order to maintain a civil and cohesive overall experience, and encourage active and engaged community online, Orkut has now introduced more controls for community owners.

### More controls:

  1. Access to &#8211; ***only owner and moderators can create forum topics*** . This can be turned ON an OFF as desired from the “edit profile” page of your community.
  2. Access to &#8211; ***only owner and moderators can create polls*** . This can also be turned ON an OFF as desired from the “edit profile” page of your community.

</p>

According to the Orkut blog:

> *When passions run high, you can now make use of this feature within your community. You can also try creating a few new forum topics like &#8220;Rant Room&#8221; or &#8220;Suggest new forum topics,&#8221; where community members can continue their discussions without affecting everyone else&#8217;s experience.*

Now, the world of Orkut can hopefully breathe a quiet sigh of relief!
