Now another interesting and useful service from Airtel has been launched, wherein Airtel have announced their tie-up with India&#8217;s  leading online entertainment ticketing company &#8211; <a href="http://www.bookmyshow.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bookmyshow.com', 'bookmyshow']);" >bookmyshow</a>.

  To avail this facility you just need a GPRS enabled phone or you can also call Airtel’s customer care. Henceforth, if you want to book a movie, show, dance or any other entertainment event ticket then forget about all hassles of going early to the venue, dabbling around office computer by keeping an eye on surrounding, blah blah. Just take your mobile log on to  Airtel WAP site &#8211; <a href="http://live.airtelworld.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://live.airtelworld.com', 'live.airtelworld.com']);" >live.airtelworld.com</a> (Airtel Live) and choose the option to book movie tickets. Thats it! Now tickets will be delivered at your door steps. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  Nice initiative right? Now mobile service providers are trying to hook up their valued customers by such value added services due to stringent competition. So if you are an Airtel customer, give this cool service a try next time you are planning for an event!

  Alternatively, if you own a cell phone of some other service provider (Except Airtel) and have a GPRS enabled mobile, then you can also directly book your tickets via BookMyShow by visiting <a href="http://m.bookmyshow.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.bookmyshow.com', 'm.bookmyshow.com']);" >m.bookmyshow.com</a>.
