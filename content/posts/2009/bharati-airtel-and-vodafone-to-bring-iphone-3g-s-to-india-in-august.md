In August, Bharati Airtel and Vodafone Essar will bring Apple’s latest iPhone- iPhone 3G S to India. We are still unsure about the date and the iPhone pricing for Indian market. Apple has exclusive tie-ups with Bharti and Vodafone in India. Bharti and Vodafone together account for over 170 million of the over 400 million cellphone users in the country.

This phone was unveiled in the US earlier this week. iPhone 3G S claims to offer the fastest, most powerful iPhone yet, packed with new features including improved speed and performance, up to twice as fast as iPhone 3G, with longer battery life, a high-quality 3 megapixel autofocus camera, easy to use video recording and hands free voice control. iPhone 3G S is said to be twice the capacity for the same price with a 16GB model for just $199 and a new 32GB model for just $299.

For more details, please refer to [Shyam’s earlier post on iPhone 3G S on Devils Workshop][1].

As per Apple’s issued guidance, the iPhone 3G S would be launched in 31 other countries in August. Additionally, as per information made public by Apple, the iPhone 3G S will go on sale in 10 countries, including the US on June 19, and another 32 countries in the month of July.

### Competition for iPhone 3G S in India?

Possibly Nokia’s N97 and similar offerings from BlackBerry and Samsung.

Let’s wait and watch how iPhone 3G S is introduced in the Indian market. If it is coupled with a steep price tag and poor advertising, then it would result in a huge failure, like for the earlier model.

Do share your comments on what you think.
