Out of all the new features, best ones are&#8230;

## Opera Turbo

Ever felt a Web site was loading slowly? Do you think it will happen again? Think again: Opera Turbo is a compression technology that provides significant improvements in browsing speeds over limited-bandwidth connections like a crowded Wi-Fi in a cafe or browsing through your mobile phone while commuting. Opera compresses the data when Opera turbo is turned on.

Opera 10 Beta here actually combines the best features of Google Chrome(Clear, bright, Stunning Looks), Opera Mini(Java App /Browser)(Image & Data compression) and Flock(Mail Integration).

### What makes Opera run faster than other &#8216;ordinary&#8217; browsers on slow speed?

Opera like its mobile Java version , Opera Mini, compresses data packets and thus, reduces the quality of images. So, if you want to browse wallpapers, it&#8217;ll a bad choice to turn on Opera Turbo&#8230;!!

The All-new Opera 10 is based on the engine Opera Presto 2.2 makin&#8217; it more faster, secure and reliable. Unlike Firefox, it won&#8217;t hang, leaving you stuck! It requires less memory(RAM) to run, hence it runs faster.

**Now, these are the most useful points of the all-new browser from Opera&#8211;**

  * Opera Turbo for fast browsing on slow connections.
  * New enhanced tabs and sleek design.
  * Completely Customizable looks, speed dial and everything!
  * Web Integration.
  * Data and Image compression which reduces the quality of images yet makes browsing upto 3x faster.
