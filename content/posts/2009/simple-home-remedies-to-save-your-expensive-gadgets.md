## <span><span style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rescue your cell from water</strong></span></span>

<span><span style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/oops-cell-phone-slashing-into-water-thumb5060983.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4911" style="margin: 3px;" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/oops-cell-phone-slashing-into-water-thumb5060983.jpg" alt="Cell Phone slashing into water" width="87" height="84" /></a></span></span><span><span style="text-align: justify;">You always try to protect your cell from not going into water, but atleast once in its lifetime, it finds its way into water. That&#8217;s a very sad moment. But does this mean that it’s time to abandon your cell phone? No! Especially not if you try this home remedy.</span></span>

  * First of all, take out the phone battery from the cell immediately. This will prevent electrical short circuits within the cell which can even burn the internal parts of your cell.

  * [<img class="size-medium wp-image-4909 alignright" style="margin: 3px;" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/blackberry-in-rice-300x225.jpg" alt="Cell Phone in Uncooked Rice" width="219" height="165" />][2]<span><span style="text-align: justify;">Next, gently wipe your cell with a tissue, and bury it into a jar full of u</span></span><span><span style="text-align: justify;">ncooked rice. </span><span style="text-align: justify;">Yes, rice! Remember that the coconut is kept in dry rice to keep moisture away? It’s the same logic that works here too. It has been found that rice has a high chemical affinity for water. In simple words, it attracts water. So, water doesn&#8217;t stick to the cold metal of your cell, instead it is</span><span style="text-align: justify;"> soaked by the rice, thus leaving your cell dry (well, almost dry). <em>That&#8217;s awesome remedy, isn&#8217;t it?</em></span></span>

## <span><span style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Extend laptop battery</strong></span></span>

<span><span style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong>Most common problem with laptops is that that its battery runs out when you need it. So these are simple tricks to improve your laptop&#8217;s battery life.</span></span>

  * <span><span style="text-align: justify;">Remove the battery from your laptop when you are using the AC power. This reduces the constant re-charging of the battery. Maintaining the battery at full charge for extended periods can shorten its life. </span></span>
  * <span><span style="text-align: justify;">It’s a good idea to remove the charger cord frequently if you are lazy to remove the battery and fix it back into the laptop — at least once a week.<br /> </span></span>
  * <span><span style="text-align: justify;">A similar trick  works for your iPod too. If your iPod’s battery refuses to charge completely, make the battery completely </span><span style="text-align: justify;">dry. Next, simply take out the battery from the iPod and leave it outside for 24 hours. Plug it back in and notice the difference.</span></span>

## <span><span style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Print with dried cartridge ink</strong></span></span>

<span><span style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong><a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/251105_canon_printer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4908" style="margin: 3px;" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/251105_canon_printer-300x276.jpg" alt="Canon Printer" width="117" height="109" /></a>If your printer&#8217;s ink dries out just when you are in the middle of printing an important document, simply take out the cartridge from the printer and run a hair dryer for three to four minutes and place it back into the </span><span style="text-align: justify;">printer and print again while it is still warm. Experts say that the hair dryer melts the thick ink inside the cartridge, thus releasing some extra ink for a page or two. <em>Another good one!</em><br /> </span></span>

## <span><span style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Revive your dead hard drive</strong></span></span>

<span><span style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong><a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/31harddrive.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4907" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px;" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/31harddrive-300x169.jpg" alt="Hard Disk Drive (HDD)" width="244" height="142" /></a>If you have been hit by the blue screen of death (on your computer) — and the hard drive just crashed — don’t panic! You might be able to retrieve your precious data. The trick is that simply freeze the hard drive for an entire night.<br /> This might sound silly, but the logic is that, many hard drive failures are caused by worn parts that no longer fit with each other, making it impossible for the computer to read from the drive. If you freeze the drive for an entire night, lowering the temperature causes its metal and plastic internals to contract slightly. Thawing it will cause those parts to expand again, and possibly, they will bind with each other. This might not bring the drive back to its life essentially, but give you enough time to transfer your precious data to a safe place. <em>Worth a try, right? </em></span></span>
