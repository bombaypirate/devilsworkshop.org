Our reader <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=11729233806804754446" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=11729233806804754446', 'Vish']);" >Vish</a> has been facing problem while posting comments on some friends pics. You can see screenshot of new error message, *“Adding of comments temporarily disabled”*, below.

[<img class="wp-image-51743" height="122" alt="Addition of comments disabled on Orkut" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/additionofcommentsdisabledonorkut-thumb.png" width="468" border="0" />][1]

While I am not sure if this is bug on Orkut, there are few activities which may cause this problem.

  * [Using a scrap all script to send scraps to all friend][2] 
  * [Flooding any scrapbook][3] 
  * [Deleting all scraps from your scrapbook using script][4] 
  * [Deleting all orkut inbox messages using script][5] 
  * [Deleting all pending friend requests][6] 

Any of above activity, or any other similar activity, performed intentionally or unintentionally by you or on your behalf may block you temporarily from performing few activities on Orkut.

In case of such use of scripting, you will be banned to add comments, post scraps, etc. Your account will go into sort of read-only mode for 8-10 hours. 

Now if you continue to see error after 1-2 days, then try sending a scrap to a friend. If you get again temporarily disabled error, then problem is with your account. If you are not performing any activity as mentioned above, its time to change your orkut login password as chances are someone else, a person or a third-party orkut tool/service, abusing your account.

Just in case this error keeps coming only with comments on photos, don’t worry much. A similar bug was reported on Orkut in the past. So hopefully, problem will be rectified automatically in coming days by Orkut itself.
