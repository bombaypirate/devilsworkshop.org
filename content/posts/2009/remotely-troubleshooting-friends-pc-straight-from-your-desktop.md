Software not being installed correctly, Software not functioning the way it should, Driver problem, Configuring IIS on windows, Resizing Partitions etc

There are time when you must have faced a situation in which a friend of yours could help you out only if he could have access to your PC. Not only troubleshooting, if you have multiple systems and keep one turned on while not being physically present, this software may come as a life saver.

Its basic version is free but has various other flavours for which you need to pay depending on the Version you are opting for.

All you have to do is download the LogMeIn Client and register for a free account. Install the client on every PC you wish to access remotely using your credentials. Then, you can connect to the system from anywhere in the world as long as it has a decent broadband net connection.

<a href="http://www.logmein.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.logmein.com', 'LogMeIn']);" title="LogMeIn">LogMeIn</a> allows control of the PC through Mouse, Keyboard and you can see the Desktop to work as if it was your own PC! I access my system from my college lab to view the status of the active torrents which i leave behind running when I am not home. Its that easy and cool.

Feel free to drop in your comments.
