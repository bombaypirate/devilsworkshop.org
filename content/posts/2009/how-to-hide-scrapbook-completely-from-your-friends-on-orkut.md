Ketan Goyal and few other readers are interested in hiding their Orkut scrapbook from their Orkut friends.

Sometimes it happens that you get a friend request from a bully from your school or workplace. You love your privacy but you cannot reject his request as you are in same social circle. At such times you really wish you can just hide your scrapbook, albums and other content from such people even after accepting their friend requests.

Now such privacy features are available on Facebook but on Orkut there is no official way. Personally, I am waiting for such feature on Orkut sine long but for time being I am using a workaround.

I run [Orkut scrapbook cleaner script][1] periodically on my account. This script when run, deletes all your scraps automatically.

I know it really hurts to delete all your scraps but that&#8217;s the best way to avoid information misuse. If you have some important content in any scrap, you can copy it to your email account or save it as a file on your computer.

I hope Orkut will improve its [scrapbook privacy features][2] in near future. Till that time if you are really concerned about your privacy, you can use this script.
