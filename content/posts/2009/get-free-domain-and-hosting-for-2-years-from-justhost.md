I remember few months ago Dreamhost was giving free hosting for 2 years to Geocities users, if you have missed that opportunity here is another chance to get free hosting for 2 years from JustHost.

### How to get free hosting

<a href="http://www.justhost.com/signup" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.justhost.com/signup', 'Click here']);" >Click here</a> to go to sign up page. Now select *Please register a new domain* *for me* and in the Coupon code type **DOMAIN4LIFE** and click on Continue.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

When you will click on Continue, you will be taken to the next page, here enter your details.

Please note that you will need a credit card to get this hosting. After entering the credit card details, at the bottom click on Complete and wooo, you have got a free domain and hosting for 2 years.

### Alternative Code

If by any chance this coupon code is not working, you can also enter the alternate code **TEMPLATEMONSTER**. This will give you free hosting for 1 year.

### What you will get

  * Free $25 Google Adwords credit
  * $25 Yahoo Marketing Credit
  * $200 Automated Sales agent credit and many more&#8230;
