Most of the top SEO experts and webmasters always emphasize on targeting social media for traffic building.

<p align="justify">
  The major websites that plays a considerable role on building great amount of Traffic are <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.stumbleupon.com/', 'Stumble Upon']);" >Stumble Upon</a>, <a href="http://www.digg.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.digg.com/', 'Digg']);" >Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reddit.com/', 'Reddit']);" >Reddit</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twitter.com', 'Twitter']);" >Twitter</a>. The most common thing about these websites are they entertain quality over quantity.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Twitter have given a new look to social media in terms of traffic building. In case if you are not aware of Twitter . It is a micro blogging platform and simple answer to all the&#160; question "Where are you and what are you doing ?". Read more about twitter <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/twitter-explained-in-plain-english/">here</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  When it comes to <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-know-when-any-article-is-submitted-from-your-website-on-digg-and-get-notified.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-know-when-any-article-is-submitted-from-your-website-on-digg-and-get-notified.html', 'Digg']);" >Digg</a> and <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.stumbleupon.com', 'Stumble upon']);" >Stumble upon</a> the significant difference is on traffic flow. Digg can give you over 10k+ traffic overnight if your post appear on the front page and same is in the case of stumble upon but the major difference is that stumble upon traffic keep flowing after that also.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  One of the important aspect of social media is quality back links from many websites. If your post become popular you will get back links from many social news aggregate websites and that will be benefit for good SEO and page rank.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Now achieving success in social media is quite time consuming and if you think you can spare 2 hour daily then only target social media else quality posts are the best solution for you.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  This is for all those who submit their posts on social media sites like Digg, stumble upon and reddit. Overdoing of anything is bad for you and your websites. This might lead to blacklisting of your domain. So instead of submitting every post, submit posts which are favored by these websites.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Posts like <strong>"Top 10" , "Most amazing", "America politics news"</strong> are always favored by these websites but when you write and post to target social media do a complete research before you hit the publish button.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  If you want to understand Digg more your can refer to my articles on <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/digg-the-beginners-guide.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shoutmeloud.com/digg-the-beginners-guide.html', 'Digg: The beginners guide']);" >Digg: The beginners guide</a>.

  <em>Tips on getting recognized on Social Media:</em>
</h3>

<p align="justify">
  # <strong>Maintain your Identity</strong>: Using one <strong>handle</strong> (Nickname) and <strong>common logo</strong> will make you recognize easily. The best practice will be if you can use common username and nickname everywhere this will lead to universal presence. You can check the availability of your desired username everywhere by using <a href="http://www.usernamecheck.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.usernamecheck.com/', 'usernamecheck']);" >usernamecheck</a> website.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  # <strong>Submit quality contents</strong> : If you want to see a difference, then instead of submitting content from your blog you should also submit quality posts from white-listed websites like <a href="http://mashable.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mashable.com/', 'mashable']);" >mashable</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/', 'washington posts']);" >washington posts</a>, <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lifehacker.com/', 'Lifehacker']);" >Lifehacker</a> and many more. There are two benefit of doing it, first is all people will recognize your submission and&#160; second you will have an insight on what kind of contents people like to see. If you submit each and every contents from your website/blog I recommend stop doing so because soon your blog will be marked as spam-blog. If we talk about Digg or stumble upon there are many websites and blogs which are banned from them because of this.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  # <strong>Socialize</strong> : It&#8217;s very important aspect of social media you need to understand people there. People who are social media experts are generally webmaster, SEO. If you connect with them offline too that will be very helpful for you. I have experienced it and I know the importance of it. You can socialize with them using either IM&#8217;s, twitter or E-mail.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  # <strong>Review them</strong> : This is specially in the case of stumble upon . If you like someone submission, sending them a word of appreciation will buy respect for you. If we talk about websites like digg, reddit, delicious then dropping a word of appreciation by email or PM will be productive for you later.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  # <strong>Commenting</strong> : Comments last for ever and adding appropriate comments which add value to the submission or post is always recognized and that too is good for your own identity because people recognize you for you valuable comment and like minded people will love to add you in their friends list.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Though it&#8217;s very important that when you plan to target social media to promote your articles make sure you have created your identity there and for that you need to be a quality contributor rather then quantity contributor.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  If you have not targeted social media traffic you are missing a significant amount of traffic for your blog. Try to give it a shot but make sure to follow the important rules mentioned above.
