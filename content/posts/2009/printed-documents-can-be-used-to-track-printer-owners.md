While printing pages, some Laser printers print tracking dots that are invisible but contains crucial data in it, and these dots can be used to track the Serial Number of the printer and the owner can be easily traced.

The US government has succeeded in persuading some color laser printer manufacturers to encode each page with identifying information. That means that without your knowledge or consent, an act you assume is private could become public. These tracking dots include :

  * date
  * time
  * printer serial number of a laser printed sheet

You can read the whole list of printers which do or do not display Tracking Dots <a href="http://www.eff.org/pages/list-printers-which-do-or-do-not-display-tracking-dots" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eff.org/pages/list-printers-which-do-or-do-not-display-tracking-dots', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>.

Now, every time you print a document, it will automatically include a secret code that will be used to find the printer owner.
