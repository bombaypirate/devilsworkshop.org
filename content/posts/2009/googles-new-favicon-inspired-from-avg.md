Today, I was surprised to see the new favicon on google and its related sites. I knew someone would have surely made an entry on Devil&#8217;s workshop and Deepak did mentioned it <a title="here" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/again-google-revamped-its-favicon/" target="_blank">here</a>. But the new image was so familiar to me and later I found out it was like that of <a href="http://free.avg.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://free.avg.com/', 'AVG']);" title="AVG"  target="_blank">AVG</a> antivirus logo. Actually, Google was inspired for the new logo by a design submitted by André Resende, a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Campinas in Brazil. But I think this what would have actually happened.

**AVG favicon + 90 degree turn + Old favicon + Some smudging -> New favicon**
