  Recently I saw an item on my feed reader that mentioned about some YouTube <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=cTDln2f0GvQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=cTDln2f0GvQ', 'videos']);" target="_blank">videos</a> wherein a â€˜downloadâ€™ option was present by default. Though there are thousand of softwares available to download videos from YouTube, but there are many such users who were desperately waiting to see such feature inside YouTube. Seems YouTube have heard such users and rolled out this feature, though all YouTube videos donâ€™t have this option yet.

  Possibly, like Orkut, YouTube too, is trying to roll out this new feature phase wise. Or YouTube may be promoting viewers to view Obamaâ€™s video, because as of now I saw this (Download) feature only in â€˜manyâ€™ videos related to Obama. But I am still optimist and think YouTube is rolling this feature slowly to all its videos! ðŸ˜‰
