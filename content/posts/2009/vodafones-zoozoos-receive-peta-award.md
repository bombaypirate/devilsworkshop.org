Here&#8217;s good news for the ZooZoos fans. Vodafone has won the first Glitter Box award which was given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals', 'PETA']);" title="PETA">PETA</a> (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) India. This award is given to those businesses that take the advantage of humane alternatives to the use of real animals in their advertisements. <!--more-->

Vodafone has started a new ad campaign &#8216;ZooZoo&#8217; in the place of its old ad campaign which contained a &#8216;pug&#8217;. PETA had also raised objections in the past to the use of animals in Vodafone&#8217;s ad campaigns.

> The &#8216;pug&#8217; advertisement was bad for real life pugs as many viewers purchased pugs and breeders cranked out as many puppies as they could. Late when the fad appeal wore off, many dogs ended up in shelters or were abandoned, **the release said.**
