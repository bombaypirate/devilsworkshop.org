Twitter has released the [Retweet feature][1] on its website albeit the feature is still in BETA. I have written previously about it, but my <a href="http://twitter.com/bombaypirate" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/bombaypirate', 'Twitter account']);" >Twitter account</a> is now part of the beta experiment, hence I was able to experiment a bit with Twitter&#8217;s **ReTweet** feature. I liked a few things but I think there is room for improvements. If you see the below image after logging into your Twitter account, your account is also part of the experiment. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### The Good

  * There is no need to copy-paste or use the various desktop applications to send a **Retweet**. Click on the **Retweet** button on the tweet you are reading and it is sent to all your followers as **Retweet**.
  * There was a way for me to keep track of all the Retweet activity by checking on details like **Retweets by others**, **Retweets by you** and **Your tweets, retweeted**. ðŸ˜‰
  * I liked the feature where I could **undo the Retweet**. This is great option if you have inadvertently done a Retweet to a spurious link by someone.

### The Bad

  * The **Retweet** option does not show up when you look up tweets in a list. This means if I am looking up tweets in my list I need to visit the profile page to send a Retweet.
  * I guess this is because it it not integrated with [**Twitter Lists**][2]. I hope this is a temporary thing, as I would find it quite cumbersome to visit the profile of someone I am following every time just for sending a **Retweet**.
