With two giants already in this cut-throat competition, Opera browser has preserved its place firmly among its tiny share of user base (0.71% in 2009 Q1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers', 'according to Wikipedia']);" >according to Wikipedia</a>).

So, what makes its users stick to it by the way? The features it offers of course. Here is a list of 10 such unique features of Opera that you may not find in other browsers all at once. Of course, some browsers like Firefox have plugins for most of them, but again adding plugins to Firefox slows it down.

## 10 Unique Features of Opera Browser

  1. **Speed Dial**: The most innovative of all, this feature creates thumbnails of your favorite sites. Clicking on that thumbnail takes you directly to that site.
  2. **Feed preview**: From Opera 9.63, you can view the feed content before subscribing to that feed.
  3. **IRC client**: Enjoy IRC right from your browser itself. You don&#8217;t need any dedicated client to enjoy IRC.
  4. **Opera Mail**: Opera has a built in Mail client too. Again, no need to install any dedicated mail client.
  5. **Notes**: Find something interesting on web and want to jot it down immediately? Notes are at your service.
  6. **Web Page preview**: A great feature to resemble Windows Vista&#8217;s Live Thumbnail preview. Hover your mouse cursor over a browser tab and a small thumbnail of the webpage is displayed.
  7. **Torrent client**: From Opera 5, it is shipped with a built in torrent downloading client. This shipment is the result of agreement between Opera Software and BitTorrent way back in 2001.
  8. **Trash can**: This simple feature can save you a precious time on web as it can open closed tabs. If you&#8217;ve mistakenly closed an important tab, just head on to Trash can and restore your tab back.
  9. **Scroll marker**: Starting from Opera 9.63, this feature marks at the end of the webpage window, so you can continue reading from that mark while scrolling.
 10. **Mouse gestures**: As the name suggests, this feature performs mundane tasks by movement of your mouse.
