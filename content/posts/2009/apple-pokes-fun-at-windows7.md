They have released a series of ads making fun of Windows 7.

This particular ad is called &#8220;Broken Promises&#8221; which has a man called PC who resembles Bill Gates slightly and another man called Mac who are talking about Windows 7 and how it wont have any problems that previous Windows versions had.

I personally think such advertisements can be considered petty and it is not always a good strategy to make fun of your rivals. Every one knows Mac is better than most machines that run Windows but then Mac is also more expensive than 90% of the Machines that run Windows.



Early reports and reviews on Windows 7 give the impression that it is the best thing to come out of Microsoft but there is still one problem consumers will have. The migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 is being called very complicated and a test of patience and it seems that is what Apple will look to highlight.

I wonder what sort of advertisements would go out when Google launches its Chrome OS. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
