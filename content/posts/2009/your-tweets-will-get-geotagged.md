With the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/11/think-globally-tweet-locally.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.twitter.com/2009/11/think-globally-tweet-locally.html', 'announcement']);" >announcement</a> of **Geotagging** feature for your tweets, Twitter has added another feather in their cap. With this feature, all your tweets would be tagged and enabling a person to know, exactly from which location you are tweeting.

What is the need of this? Well, with the help of geographical data, display of local ads and information will be much more easy.

*Twitter&#8217;s Geotagging in Action*

But don&#8217;t worry. If you think, this is a security breach in your privacy, this service is NOT enabled by default. You have to enable it manually.

### How to Enable/Disable Twitter Geotagging:

  1. <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
      Login to Twitter and go to Settings page.
    </p>

  2. Scroll down in the accounts tab. There you can enable or disable the geotagging feature.

You are also given an option to delete all the previous location data that has been geotagged on Twitter, just in case you want a complete opt-out from the service. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
