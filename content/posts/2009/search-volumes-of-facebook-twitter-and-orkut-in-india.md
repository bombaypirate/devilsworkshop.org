Over the last two years I have started using Facebook a lot more than Orkut and recently Twitter has become quite addictive. So it got me thinking how did these websites compare on Google Search.

I decided to compare the three websites and their search volumes over the internet using <a href="http://www.google.com/insights" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/insights', 'Google Insights']);" >Google Insights</a>.

The calculations are done on comparable percentile.

The high is taken as 100 and then the averages are calculated in comparison to the 100.

### In 2007

Orkut was at an average of 80 and Facebook only 3 with Twitter comparatively standing a hopeless zero.

### In 2009

Clearly Facebook has made an impact with 46 and Orkut has had a constant high of 92 as the red line shows compared to the blue. But looking at the graph Facebook and Orkut seem to be at a meeting point sometime in January next year.  😉

  * Orkut was at 100 at a particular high on the graph hence an average of 92 this year signals a much more consistant performance than back in 2007 when it was at 80.
  * It might also mean that this year Orkut is hit a plateau and not really managing to grow its user base in India as Facebook is doing.
  * A similar study of insights done for the whole world shows Orkut at zero pretty much for the last five years. 😐
