Finally, the days of deals for out ever loved VOIP communication <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-17045" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/skype.jpg" alt="skype" width="148" height="71" />software, <a href="http://www.skype.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.skype.com/', 'Skype']);" >Skype</a> have ended and it has been sold. Skype, which was originally acquired by the online auction giant, <a href="http://www.ebay.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ebay.com', 'eBay']);" >eBay</a> has been sold and the deal is completed. The confirmation is given on the <a href="http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2009/11/sale_completed.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2009/11/sale_completed.html', 'Official Skype Blog']);" >Official Skype Blog</a>

The investor group is led by Silver lakes. The deal valued Skype at a massive exchange of $2.75 B, with eBay still retaining approximately 33% of it.

eBay purchased on the first hand in September 2005, for $3.1 billion and worked hard to integrate it into the mainstream business model.

**Would it make any difference to me?**

Of course, yes. Since skype is now owned by a new company, expect a more feature packed and reloaded skype.

**The impacts**

With Skype being the most popular VOIP client in the world, maybe more companies will jump into the market. The competition will elevate the quality of service. If that doesn&#8217;t happens, Skype will be much better than what it presently is. Anyway, I believe it is a win-win situation for the customers!

We wish Skype all the best for the future and hope it becomes much better and let&#8217;s us continue to cut our phone bills and staying close to our friends, at the same time <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
