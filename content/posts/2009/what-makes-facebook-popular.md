There has got to be something that it’s doing extremely well to have achieved such heights. So, let’s take a look at some of the areas where Facebook has gone “right”, and added to its rapid growth.

### 1. Clean design

Reports from Neilson Online tell us that most people find Facebook to be well organized, simple and easy-******<img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px;" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/07/clip_image00211.jpg" alt="clip_image002[11]" width="204" height="201" align="right" border="0" hspace="12" />******to use. I personally found Facebook really confusing at first, till I eventually got used to it. Although opinions might vary, Orkut, in my books, is a lot simpler with a much easy-to-use interface.

### **[2. Privacy controls][2]**

Users have a much higher control over their content and account, and can [manage who sees their content or not][3]. Facebook has tailored its privacy controls based on 3 principles: Control, Simplicity and Connection.

### 3. Little advertising clutter

Reports indicate that Facebook appeals to a larger audience because of less advertising compared to many of its competitors.

### 4. Large demographic

Facebook has a broader appeal and is not limited to a particular demographic as such, like students or youth alone.

### 5. Multi-purpose networking activities

Facebook focuses not just on entertainment but also connecting. Facebook is an all-in-one &#8211; Reunion, LinkedIn, Yahoo! Personals, Flickr and Twitter all put together.

### 6. Creative architecture and features

Various applications, invites, requests and Facebook’s open architecture are some of the things that have led to a much higher visitor engagement.

### 7. Media buzz

Facebook took off well from minute go due to the large free media coverage it received and still is till date.

## Local offerings keep Facebook at bay in some countries:

Facebook has majorly come into global prominence in the last two years. However, there are countries where Facebook is yet to catch up. For instance:

  * In **Germany**, local player Wer-kennt-wen is twice as popular as Facebook.
  * In **Japan**, Mixi is around 27 times more popular than Facebook.
  * In **Brazil**, Orkut is 29 times more popular. Facebook barely exists in Brazil compared to Orkut – being visited by just over 2% of Brazilians online.
  * In **China**, because of a different culture, language and the regulatory issues of doing business, the US social networks aren’t dominant there. By the time the US networks arrived, local players such as Xiaonei; the portal QQ and 51.com had achieved dominance in key demographic groups.
  * In the **US **also, MySpace had established itself as an entertainment portal rather than just a pure social network. Although Facebook has taken over MySpace, but it still remains a huge player in the country.

Do you, as a Facebook user, agree with the statistics from the report mentioned above? Feel free to add more points to the list and share your thoughts on what you think.
