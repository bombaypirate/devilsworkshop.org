<img class="alignleft wp-image-53688" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ovRzqKMK4D0/SkoJbjSlsUI/AAAAAAAABIU/MuEJknGNp5o/s200/google-adsense-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" height="74" />Google Adsense, as we know, is the pioneer of content-related advertising, using bloggers, small-time business or any website (that gets approved!) as advertising estate. Their revenue system helps many people get online and earn a little dough (or for some people like [Rahul][1], a full-time income!) The ads come from another Google service called Adwords, where advertisers just create ads and set of on campaigning. However, all this automated behavior by Google is bound to create bloopers!

Take for example, during the 26 Nov. Mumbai shooting, the following ad was reported by <a href="http://notesfromearth.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://notesfromearth.com/', 'notesfromearth']);" >notesfromearth</a> on IBNlive (newportal):

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <img src="http://notesfromearthy.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/googlebad-1.jpg" alt="Terrorism Anyone?" width="567" height="588" />
    </dt>
    
    <dd>
      Terrorism Anyone?
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

Another weird ad, that came out due to the automated and non-reviewing nature of Adsense is seen below. This ad came in my Gmail account, when I was reading about Photoshop.

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <img class="size-full wp-image-11583" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/adsense.jpg" alt="Qulity. Oh Yeah!" width="304" height="254" />
    </dt>
    
    <dd>
      High qulity. Oh Yeah!
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p style="text-align: left">
  I&#8217;d have to say that this ad had no relation to the content I was reading, and the ad had no meaning or clarity itself!
</p>

Another one came in the Adsense dashboard of the author of <a href="http://www.hooverwebdesign.com/blog" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hooverwebdesign.com/blog', 'Hoover Web Design Blog']);" target="_blank">Hoover Web Design Blog</a>.

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <img class="size-full wp-image-11597" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/weird-google.gif" alt="WTF!" width="526" height="447" />
    </dt>
    
    <dd>
      WTF!
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

Here is another funny one from <a href="http://www.geckoandfly.com/2007/04/11/are-you-stupid-google-adsense-ad/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.geckoandfly.com/2007/04/11/are-you-stupid-google-adsense-ad/', 'geckoandfly.com']);" target="_self">geckoandfly.com</a>

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <img src="http://www.geckoandfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/simple_google_adsense_ad_ban.jpg" alt="Let me know what Google says!?" width="468" height="81" />
    </dt>
    
    <dd>
      Let me know what Google says!?
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

Not saying anything against Google. It&#8217;s one of the best tools on the web that helps us earn money. However, a little rectification of that famous code could improve it. What say?
