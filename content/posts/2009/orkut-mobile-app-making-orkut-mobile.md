Looking at this trend, Orkut has now come up with a mobile application offering Orkut’s core functionality to users wherever they happen to be.

With the beta launch of Orkut’s Mobile application, you can make your Orkut account as mobile as you are.

### How much does it cost?

The application is **free** to download and use, however, your phone provider&#8217;s regular data charges will apply, so you might want to check that out first.

I think this is totally awesome. If you get a chance to play around with its feature, do share your experience with us here.
