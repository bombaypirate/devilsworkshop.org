<img class="alignright wp-image-52953" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3303/3484963606_943f3eb726.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="110" />There’s just something about radio &#8211; that element of surprise, that anticipation of what’s coming next, that man-I-haven’t-heard-that-song-in-years sensation. That’s the promise of the new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307564553&mt=8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307564553&mt=8', 'free Yahoo! Music iPhone app']);" >free Yahoo! Music iPhone app</a>. Powered by <a href="http://www.cbsradio.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cbsradio.com', 'CBS Radio']);" >CBS Radio</a>, it lets you browse through 300+ stations within more than 20 genres (from Bollywood to Goth to Naughty Comedy). CBS RADIO crammed a lot of great features into the Yahoo! Music app so that you will never be without your favorite music when you’re on the go. Here are just a few of the great features included:

  * Browse through 20+ genres
  * Skip up to six songs an hour
  * Browse stations by genre or find local stations ‘near you’ utilizing GPS
  * Share stations with friends
  * Browse your listening history or recently played stations
  * Buy albums/songs via iTunes
  * Listen to 1010WINS, KROQ, WFAN and more than a hundred other CBS RADIO stations in addition to Yahoo! Music’s 150 music stations
  * Add presets for instant access to your favorite stations

The Y! Music app streams two distinct kinds of stations; interactive & non-interactive. The main difference between interactive and non-interactive streams is the ability to skip songs. Every time you launch an interactive station, you will be listening to a unique music experience. No two streams are the same! With non-interactive stations, you will be listening to the same stream that is being broadcast on the air. If you&#8217;re in Los Angeles, you can listen to a station in New York as if you were really there! It&#8217;s like being in two places at once!
