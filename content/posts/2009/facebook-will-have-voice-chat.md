Just when I thought Facebook has done quite a bit in the past month of so with a [new version][1] and [added features][2] it has gone ahead and announced that soon its users will be able use voice chat in the near future.

Facebook&#8217;s voice chatting service will be powered by Vivox Labs.

So gear up to voice chat with your Facebook friends very soon.

### How does Facebook plan to do it?

  * Facebook has got <a href="http://vivox.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vivox.com', 'Vivox Labs']);" >Vivox Labs</a> a voice chat provider for Video Games to allow voice chatting for Facebook Users.
  * Facebook users will be allowed to use voice chatting for even playing games online on Facebook.
  * Vivox Labs announced that these results should be out in Q4 of 2009. So Voice chat on facebook should be up and running before the year ends.

What this will do finally is make Facebook a very active competitor to Skype and other voice chat providers.

I wonder whats next for Facebook! Video Conferencing? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
