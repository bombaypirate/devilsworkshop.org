For all those Twitter users who don’t quite have an audience for their messages or are struggling to find more can now actually buy them. That’s right… now you can get 1,000 brand new Twitter followers starting at $87 in 7 days to 100,000 Twitter followers in 1 year for $3,479 from uSocial&#8217;s Twitter follower service.

uSocial is an Australian social media marketing company that provides cheap ways of generating high-quality, unique traffic.

## How does this work?

uSocial finds potential followers for your Twitter account by:

  * Searching Twitter and working out what individual users are interested in.
  * Profiling where people are so it can more closely match users with those they might want to follow.
  * Sending messages to potential followers telling them about the new Twitter user they might want to follow.
  * It is up to the user to follow them or not, which means uSocial will keep looking for followers until the specified number is achieved.

This service claims to guarantee the users a large number of new followers in a set time frame. In case that does not happen, the company promises to get the users 20% more followers than they have paid for in the end.

There are various offers available. Take a look:
