After Brazil&#8217;s Morro de Sao Paolo beach, the free service is code-named as **Morro!**

Currently, Microsoft is testing the product within the organization with their employees. Once the testing completes, Microsoft plans to make a trial version or maybe a product beta which will be available for the general public from its website.

### Morro to take over Microsoft’s Live OneCare?

Morro is being introduced into the market after Microsoft’s commercial flop &#8211; Live OneCare 3 years ago. Microsoft had announced in November that it plans to burry that product suite and is gearing up to make a come back with the free Morro service by the end of 2009. We are still unsure about its exact launch date.

Windows Live OneCare will continue to be sold for Windows XP and Windows Vista at retail through June 30, 2009. Direct sales of OneCare will be gradually phased out when “Morro” becomes available.

## Features

According to Microsoft, Morro will offer basic features like fighting wide range malicious software including viruses, spyware, rootkits and trojans, making it comparable to low-end consumer products already existing in the market.

It is being said that the launch of the free Antivirus from Microsoft could overthrow sales of Symantec and McAfee products that cost about $40 per year, currently generating billions of dollars a year.

## Supported Operating Systems

“Morro” will be available as a stand-alone download and offer malware protection for

  * Windows XP
  * Windows Vista
  * Windows 7 operating systems.

Microsoft says that when used in conjunction with the ongoing security and privacy enhancements of Windows and Internet Explorer, this new solution will offer consumers a robust, no-cost security solution to help protect against the majority of online threats.

It sure will be very interesting to see how the features of Morro would compare against products from its competitors. Let’s wait and watch!
