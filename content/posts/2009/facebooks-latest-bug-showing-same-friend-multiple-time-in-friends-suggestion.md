I must say that last few weeks were not good for<a href="http://www.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com', ' facebook.com']);" > facebook.com</a> and it&#8217;s designer team. First the <a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/10/24/refreshed-news-feed-look-new-facebook-homepage/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/10/24/refreshed-news-feed-look-new-facebook-homepage/', 'new news feed']);" >new news feed</a> which was not liked by most of it&#8217;s users and then the <a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/10/28/the-latest-facebook-virus-via-password-reset-e-mails/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/10/28/the-latest-facebook-virus-via-password-reset-e-mails/', 'virus which attacked Facebook']);" >virus which attacked Facebook</a> last month. And now we have some bugs on the world&#8217;s best social networking site one of which is in the friend&#8217;s suggestions or find friends section.

Yes the friend&#8217;s suggestion column which show the people you can add as friends and become a fan of public profiles you like. It&#8217;s working fine but the bug here is that it&#8217;s showing same friend multiple time on the same page ðŸ˜›

Just check out the screenshot below and see what I mean.

Obviously it&#8217;s not a bug that harms someone, it&#8217;s just so annoying to hide the same suggestion again and again. To go to your friend&#8217;s suggestion page <a href="http://www.facebook.com/find-friends/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/find-friends/', 'click here']);" target="_self">click here</a> and see whether it&#8217;s there in your profile or not.
