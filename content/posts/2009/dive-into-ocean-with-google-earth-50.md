  Google over the last years have developed many things that many never imagined to be possible. Continuing the trend of online search, Google launched a new service on Monday to allow Internet users to explore the depths of the oceans from the comfort of their homes on dry land.

<p align="justify">
  The “Ocean in Google Earth” feature allows users to virtually dive beneath the water surface, explore 3 D underwater terrain and browse ocean-related content contributed by marine scientists.

  Ocean in Google Earth was unveiled formally at the San Francisco Academy of Sciences by former vice president Al Gore, acclaimed oceanographer Sylvia Earle and Google executives.

  Users can click icons on “sea maps” to see video of creatures that thrive in those locations. Internet surfers can opt to swim virtually undersea as though they are sharks, dolphins or turtles. The feature includes 20 different layers of content contributed by leading ocean explorers, scientists and researchers, like photos and videos of “hot spots” around the world and information on marine protected areas.
