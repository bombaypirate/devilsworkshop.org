Yahoo Messenger, one of the most popular messenger for &#8216;Instant Messaging&#8217; worldwide. But the main reason why people are not able to chat everytime on Y! messenger is that they have to download the whole software and install it which is not possible all the time specially when you are using internet from a cyber cafe, you friend&#8217;s laptop or your college&#8217;s Internet lab.

Most of the people uses <a href="http://www.meebo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meebo.com', 'Meebo']);" target="_self">Meebo</a> as an alternative which is obviously a good option. But there&#8217;s one more official way of chatting with your Yahoo messenger friends without even downloading anything. It&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://in.messenger.yahoo.com/platform/web/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://in.messenger.yahoo.com/platform/web/', 'Yahoo! Messenger for the web']);" target="_self">Yahoo! Messenger for the web</a>&#8221; which is currently in it&#8217;s beta stage. All you need is to type,

<a href="http://in.web.im" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://in.web.im', 'in.web.im']);" ><strong>in.web.im</strong></a>

in your address bar and you are all set to chat with your buddies. Simple isn&#8217;t it?
