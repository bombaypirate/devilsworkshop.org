Few days back, I posted about [vote on Facebook’s Governing Document][1].

Just few minutes back, I tried checking <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/', 'Facebook&#8217;s official blog']);" >Facebook&#8217;s official blog</a> as I was expecting result today when I noticed blog was down.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6528" style="border: 1px solid black" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/04/invalid-url.png" alt="invalid-url" width="469" height="233" />

Thankfully, rest of the Facebook is up and running.

**Update: **Just noticed on <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techmeme.com/', 'TechMeme']);" >TechMeme</a>, Facebook announced voting results. But again link on TechMeme, pointing to <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=79146552130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=79146552130', 'official Facebook post']);" >official Facebook post</a> is broken.

But some <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/04/facebook-governance-vote-is-a-homework-assignment-no-one-did.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/04/facebook-governance-vote-is-a-homework-assignment-no-one-did.html', 'news']);" >news</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8016532.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8016532.stm', 'sites']);" >sites</a> managed to read Facebook post before blog went down.

Following quote from David at <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/04/facebook-governance-vote-is-a-homework-assignment-no-one-did.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/04/facebook-governance-vote-is-a-homework-assignment-no-one-did.html', 'Los Angeles Time']);" >Los Angeles Time</a> suggests some bad news for privacy-savvy Facebook users who voted for new policy document&#8230;

> By the time voting closed today at noon Pacific time, only 0.32% of Facebook&#8217;s users had weighed in on the question of whether the site&#8217;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=183538190300" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=183538190300', 'lengthy new policy documents']);" >lengthy new policy documents</a> were better than <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/terms.php', 'the lengthy old ones']);" >the lengthy old ones</a>.
> 
> About 75% of that 0.32% chose the newer policy, while the rest chose the old. But the election won&#8217;t count anyway: Facebook said that for the results to be valid, 30% of its roughly 200 million users would have to weigh in. That&#8217;s about 100 times more than the 0.32% of people who actually did.
