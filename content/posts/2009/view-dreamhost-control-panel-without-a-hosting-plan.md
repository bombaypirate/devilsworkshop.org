  But I am quite happy that, now I can easily explain them or give them a demo of a Control Panel atleast, because our dear hosting company â€“ <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/dreamhost/">DreamHost</a> have now realized the problems of such guys (like my friends) and have launched a Control Panel demo portal wherein a user willing to know more about Cpanel can try out this <a href="https://demo.dreamhost.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://demo.dreamhost.com', 'DreamHost Control Panel Demo']);" >DreamHost Control Panel Demo</a>. The user interface of the demo control panel is totally similar to the actual control panel.

  So, if you are also a newbie and donâ€™t know much about these technical terms, then I would personally suggest you to just check out the options and features in this Demo Control Panel to know more and understand Control Panel, after all its totally free. ðŸ˜‰

  <strong>Updated</strong><strong></strong><strong>: </strong>While checking the demo, I was never being asked for user ID and Password, but to some others it asked for login. So, you may try &#8216;<strong>DEMO</strong>&#8216; as the ID and password.
