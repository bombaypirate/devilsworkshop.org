**Attraction of the theme:**

**Homepage:**

Homepage is what we are always looking for. Zeoal comes with highly style homepage with two feature content, stylish box style and blog style content excerpt, tabbed style recent, popular and comment widget, availability of social network, feature video, stylish footer with extremely good-looking twitter follow widget, Flickr widget, translation and of course subscription. Moreover great area for advertisement with header banner and the 125&#215;125 box banner in sidebar.  All the things said homepage is eye-catching.

**Post Page:**

Post page is also well customized with feature content (you can disable it from admin setting of theme) better placement of Adsense advertisement with post rating just below title, sociable, about the author, entry details and the threaded comments. Great to have these in free wordpress theme.

**Archives: **

There is no any archive page in theme demo. But I can give you some point about it from my side. The theme contain its own archive page with great modification. In archives page all content are categorized as date based, category based, tag based, pages and finally search area. Well enough this for any cool archive.

**Admin Panel:**

Admin panel is in JavaScript tabbed style format with stylish look. Easy to access and well required php 5 for working not sure. Check screenshot just below:
