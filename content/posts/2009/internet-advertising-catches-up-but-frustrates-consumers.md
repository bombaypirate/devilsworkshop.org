  * 4 in 5 consumers, i.e., 80% say they find ads that expand on the page and cover the content very frustrating
  * 79% say ads where they can’t find the close or skip button are very frustrating.
  * Three-quarters of consumers, i.e., 76% find Internet ads that automatically pop up very frustrating
  * Two-thirds, i.e., 66% say ads that open if they are “moused over” are very frustrating.
  * 3 in 5 consumer, i.e., 60% find both animated ads that automatically start playing and ads that play music and/or have loud soundtracks to be very frustrating.

Advertisers clearly have to walk a fine line. At least three in five consumers are very frustrated with six of the main Internet advertising characteristics, and there is the potential to see a backlash forming. Internet advertisers will have to invent more engaging ways to connect with the end users.
