When users click on a particular trending topic listed on the sidebar of the page, a short description related to the event or product will be displayed.

For example, as I clicked on ‘Typhoon Ondoy’, Twitter will show a paragraph of text, telling me what ‘Typhoon Ondoy’ is all about and why is it trending. This is particularly useful as it enables me to find out more about the natural catastrophe in the Philippines, without reading multiple updates posted by users to get an insight of what’s happening.
