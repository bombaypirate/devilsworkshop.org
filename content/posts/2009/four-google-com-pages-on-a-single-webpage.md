**Note: **The website reviewed has moved to a different location. Links have been updated.

There are many websites and web services which are interesting, useful and sometimes downright weird. <a href="http://googlegooglegooglegoogle.com.br" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlegooglegooglegoogle.com.br', 'Googlegooglegoooglegooogle']);" >Googlegooglegoooglegooogle</a> is one such website. No that is not a typo and I am not chanting Google over and over. It is a website which opens 4 <a href="http://google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com', 'Google search']);" >Google search</a> pages within a single page.

<a href="http://googlegooglegooglegoogle.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlegooglegooglegoogle.com/', '']);" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17920" title="Google X 4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/google_4times1.png" alt="Google X 4" width="550" height="350" /></a>

### About <a href="http://googlegooglegooglegoogle.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlegooglegooglegoogle.com/', 'Google X 4']);" >Google X 4</a>

  * It seems like a fun website with 4 Google search engines being accessible for you. It needs **JavaScript** to be enabled on your browser.
  * The joke about it, is that the creator was looking to purchase a url with Googlegoogle.com. It was already taken and hence he took what was available and that was Google spelt 4 times one after another. The idea to insert four search pages in one came later.
  * The website is quite useful if you want to be signed in to two or three email accounts or even follow 4 content websites. Click on the green arrow at the top and insert the address of the website you want to visit. This way you can have four different website open at the same time on the same page (see image below).
  * One drawback is the back button. This is a problem as individual pages within the page cannot be made to go back as the whole page is refreshed and you go back to the previous URL that was on the browser.

*Below is a screeshot of Â blogs we have on <a href="http://rtBlogs.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtBlogs.com', 'rtBlogs']);" >rtBlogs</a> on a single page*
