Thankfully, this will not be a hindrance for Orkut users any more.

Now, Google&#8217;s chat feature is being enabled for all Orkut users, irrespective of whether they have a Gmail ID or not. You will be able to use your existing email address as your user name and chat on the Google Talk network without any hassles.

This is still work in progress, so if you do not see this feature enabled for you yet, give it a few more days, it must be on its way into your account, for sure.Â  <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

As a security measure, you will be required to do a simple email verification in order to use this feature.
