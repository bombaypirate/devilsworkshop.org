rtCamp, a concept that I visualized during my masters course has finally become a reality.

We received all the necessary registration documents from the concerned government authority on 13th March and then I was busy for last 2-3 days building the website for â€“ rtCamp Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

We also started our <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog/', 'company blog']);" >company blog</a> which I recommend all our clients, friends, partners and everyone who wish to join us to follow. All the future announcements related to <a href="http://rtcamp.com/services/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/services/', 'our services']);" >our services</a>, <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog-network/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog-network/', 'blog-networks']);" >blog-networks</a>, etc. will be made on the <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog/', 'rtCamp blog']);" >rtCamp blog</a>. This is the last time I am annoying Devils Workshop readers with a non-technical post. ðŸ˜‰

rtCamp site is stillÂ  in infant stage as our basic goal was to inform visitors about our <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog-network/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog-network/', 'blog-network']);" >blog-network</a> and <a href="http://rtcamp.com/services/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/services/', 'services']);" >services</a> at the earliest.

As a part of our blog-network we will be launching around 10 blogs which will cover topic related to photography, finance, cricket, travel, blogging and wordpress over the next 2 months .

We will soon start our next round of recruitment. If you happen to be good wordpress programmer from Pune, you can get in touch with our <hr@rtcamp.com> ahead of time!Â  Keep checking <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog/', 'rtCamp blog']);" >rtCamp blog</a> and <a href="http://rtcamp.com/careers/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/careers/', 'career']);" >career</a> sections for more opportunities.

Thank you all for being with us. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
