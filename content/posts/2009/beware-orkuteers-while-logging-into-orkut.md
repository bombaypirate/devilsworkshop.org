  With the growth of Orkut users, there are equal amount of rise in creation of fake profiles and malicious & other hatred activities being carried out inside this ‘so called’ Social networking sites.

<p align="justify">
  Recently <a href="http://blog.arpitnext.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.arpitnext.com/', 'Arpit']);" target="_blank">Arpit</a> sent me a profile link that automatically gets diverted to a page that is cloned exactly with that of Orkut’s login page and when you enter your Orkut login information into the cloned page, they seem to store your data and automatically divert you to the homepage of Orkut.

  So, this post is to aware you on how your password too, can be hacked within seconds. To prevent from such kind of hacking, you are requested, not to provide your Orkut login information in any other sites except in Orkut. <strong>As a precautionary measure, you should always punch in your password only in the login form that you get after typing </strong><a href="http://www.orkut.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com', 'www.orkut.com']);" ><strong>www.orkut.com</strong></a><strong> on the address bar.</strong>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Those who want to have a look on the fake login page, its here. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000">But make sure that you do not enter your correct password</span></strong> on the page if you don’t want to loose your Orkut account. Open the page on your own risk, OrkutDiary will not be responsible if anything wrong goes with your account.

  <strong>Note: The link of the fake Orkut site is removed because it was not working any more. Still there are many more such sites, so beware while logging into Orkut.<br /> </strong>
