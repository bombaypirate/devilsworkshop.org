A couple of days ago I came across a great software to fix the **Internet Explorer** browser. I did not have the opportunity to test it until yesterday when a friend had his IE browser crashing. It is called **IE Utility** which fixes the Internet Explorer browser by re-registering 89 .dll and .ocx files.

### IE Utility

  * All I needed to do was <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/repair-internet-explorer-with-fix-ie-utility" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thewindowsclub.com/repair-internet-explorer-with-fix-ie-utility', 'download']);" >download</a> the .zip file. Extract its contents and run **IE Utility**.
  * It registered the .dll and .ocx files and fixed the IE browser which was crashing.
  * This is a great utility for systems which have suffered malware attacks and have their IE browser acting up.
  * Usual method of restoring the browser is to re-install it. This is not easy especially with Vista. Also re-registering .dll files by using .bat files can be quite tedious and confusing.
  * IE Utility does this all by itself after you run the software. It works with IE7 and IE8 on **Vista** and **Windows7.**
