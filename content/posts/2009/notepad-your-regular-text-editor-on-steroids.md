  One utility any Operating System can not be complete without is a text editor. To many people the first example that comes to mind is Notepad (In case of Windows). Some on the other hand, may shout &#8220;Microsoft Word&#8221;, I’d like to offer an explanation here – Word is NOT a text editor instead its a WORD PROCESSOR.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Power users, enthusiasts & programmers will agree on the fact that there are things which Notepad does better  Its a lovely piece of software that hasn’t changed much over the years. Its “Complete” in every sense of the term.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, there are little improvements which can be made and simple addons like line numbers, syntax highlighting, indentation, spell check do make life a lot easier.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Notepad++ is as the name suggests an incremental version of Notepad, its a an Open Source application and has remarkable set of features.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It would be impossible for me to write about all of its features but here’s a screen shot to make things simple, as they say, A picture speaks louder than words :

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I suggest Windows users must substitute the default Notepad for this Notepad++. It’ll be worth it. And yeah, did I mention its just 2MB and can even be added to the context menu – Open With Notepad++

Out of which my favorite is the FTP integration which allows you to edit and save files directly on the Server on the fly! Read about the FTP plugin <a href="http://www.callingallgeeks.org/updatemodify-and-save-files-on-web-server-on-the-fly-no-need-to-download-files-for-editing/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.callingallgeeks.org/updatemodify-and-save-files-on-web-server-on-the-fly-no-need-to-download-files-for-editing/', 'here']);" >here</a>.
