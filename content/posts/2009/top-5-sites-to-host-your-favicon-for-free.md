A favicon (short for favorites icon), also known as a website icon, shortcut icon, url icon, or bookmark icon is a 16&#215;16 pixel square icon associated with a particular website or webpage. You may learn how to make a favicon from [here][1]. Many free image hosting sites like photobucket, do not provide hosting for favicon files(.ico files) Getting good hosts to host these favicons is hard. Here is a list of top 4 sites that allows hosting of your favicon.

  1. ## <a href="http://www.fileave.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fileave.com/', 'Fileave']);" >Fileave</a>

My personal favorite. This site needs you to register with them before you can host images on their servers. They provide 50 MB of free storage. Hotlinking is allowed, with data transfer or bandwidth of 1 GB per month. <a href="http://www.fileave.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fileave.com/', 'Visit Fileave.']);" >Visit Fileave.</a>

  2. ## <a href="http://www.imageboo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imageboo.com/', 'ImageBoo']);" >ImageBoo</a>

You may upload the file in private or public mode, but I don&#8217;t know what it means. Both the methods give the same output! The maximum file size can be upto 2 MB. <a href="http://www.imageboo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imageboo.com/', 'Visit ImageBoo']);" >Visit ImageBoo</a>.

  3. ## <a href="http://www.picpanda.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.picpanda.com/', 'PicPanda']);" >PicPanda</a>

Allows images of upto 5 MB to be uploaded at one go. However if you register, the limit goes upto 10 MB. Hotlinking is provided. <a href="http://www.picpanda.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.picpanda.com/', 'Visit PicPanda']);" >Visit PicPanda</a>.

  4. ## <a href="http://www.qfqy.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.qfqy.com/', 'qfqy.com']);" >qfqy.com</a>

Allows you to upload images straight from your PC or from a link of the image, that may be hosted on another server. Maximum file size of a single image is 2 MB. Visit <a href="http://www.qfqy.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.qfqy.com/', 'qfqy.com']);" >qfqy.com</a>.

  5. ## <a href="http://www.myupload.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.myupload.org/', 'MyUpload.org']);" >MyUpload.org</a>

Maximum size of image that may be uploaded is 5 MB. Uploading allowed in public and private mode. <a href="http://www.myupload.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.myupload.org/', 'Visit MyUpload.org']);" >Visit MyUpload.org</a></ol>
