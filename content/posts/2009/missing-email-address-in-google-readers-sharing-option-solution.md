Google Reader is my favorite web based feed reader. I often come across posts which I want to share with directly with few people. Most of the time I am unsure if they are using Google Reader at their end. So best bet is to &#8220;email&#8221; posts to their mailbox right from Google Reader.

Now as Swati joined our blog network recently, I often needed to send her news tips and article links for Google Reader. What surprised me that Gmail&#8217;s autocomplete finds her email address correctly but Google Reader&#8217;s email function failed to autocomplete her email address. This is quite annoying as I frequently need to send her posts from Google Reader. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**Solution:**

Our another editor Deepak Jain found this solution few months back. It basically point to Gmail&#8217;s recently introduced &#8220;suggested contact&#8221; feature.

  1. Go to Gmail&#8217;s contacts.
  2. Find **suggested contacts** list.
  3. There you will find the missing email address. Just move it to main contacts.<img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/05/suggested-contacts-gmail-1.png" width="480" height="232" alt="Suggested Contacts - Gmail-1.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
  4. Now if your Google Reader is already open, reload it.
  5. Now you must be able to see missing email address is Google Reader.

That&#8217;s it. You will see **&#8220;missing contacts&#8221;** in Google Reader now.

For some weird reason, Gmail may move some particular email address to &#8220;suggested contacts&#8221; few more times. In that case follow above step until Gmail starts respecting your choice! ðŸ˜‰
