Orkut added support from mobile Orkutting sometime back by creating a mobile optimized version at m.orkut.com.

Today I noticed some scraps were marked as being **&#8220;sent from orkut mobile&#8221;** as highlighted below.

Initially, I confused it with scraps sent from mobile phones as SMS. I guess in Brazil people can use more Orkut features via mobile SMS than getting scrap notifications.

On side-note, even though Orkut do not list Airtel as supported carrier for SMS notifications, its working now! ðŸ˜‰
