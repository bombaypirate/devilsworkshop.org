Business Standard reports that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) had 4.3 billion IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses of which, 68% have already been allocated and 13% are unavailable due to technical issues.

### What is an IP address?

  * A numerical identification of a company’s name that the web understands.
  * Used to trace the origin of an email, malicious worms or location of a defamatory website or blog.

### What is IPv6?

IP version 6 (IPv6) is the next version that supports a total of 16 billion IP addresses.

> **The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) urged the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) that:**
> 
> “The fast growth of Internet and likely migration towards NGN (next generation networks) will require IPv6 addresses. In this background, the creation of a National Internet Registry (NIR) is urgently required”.

### The roadmap ahead

****

  * The Indian IT industry, however, is yet to acknowledge the need for IPv6.
  * It is very important for TRAI to create awareness about this among ISPs.

The migration could prove fatal unless there is a proper migration process in place. The Indian IT industry is yet to gear up for this migration. A whole lot of systems need to be configured and equipment needs to be put in place supporting IPv6.
