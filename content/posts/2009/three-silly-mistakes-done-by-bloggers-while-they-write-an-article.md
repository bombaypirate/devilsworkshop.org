Hi! Today I am going to share my views on &#8220;Three Silly mistakes done by blogger&#8217;s while they write an article&#8221;.

### Incorrect Hyper-linking

The most seen mistake which annoys the visitors is incorrect<span style="color: #111111;font-family: Verdana,Tahoma;font-size: 13px;line-height: 20px;text-align: justify"> URL linking. I will show your the best example for it. </span>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <span style="color: #111111;font-family: Verdana,Tahoma;font-size: 13px;line-height: 20px;text-align: justify"><img class="aligncenter size-full  wp-image-53004" style="border: black 1px grey" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/10/Incorrect-URL-linking.PNG" alt="Incorrect URL linking" width="544" height="117" /></span>
</p>

<span style="color: #111111;font-family: Verdana,Tahoma;font-size: 13px;line-height: 20px;text-align: justify"> </span><span style="color: #111111;font-family: Verdana,Tahoma;font-size: 13px;line-height: 20px;text-align: justify">Here If I keep my cursor on GoDaddy it shows me that the URL is &#8220;</span>*http://www.devilsworkshop.org/some-tips-to-follow-before-buying-a-domain-name/**www.godaddy.com**&#8220;.* This really annoys the user. Its a very common mistake and have seen this even with one of the most famous blogs like <a href="http://problogger.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://problogger.net', 'ProBlogger']);" title="ProBlogger">ProBlogger</a>.

<span style="color: #111111;font-family: Verdana,Tahoma;font-size: 13px;line-height: 20px;text-align: justify"><img class="size-full wp-image-15375 alignnone" style="border: grey 1px solid" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/10/2133qb.png" alt="The Mistake" width="576" height="92" /></span>

<span style="color: #111111;font-family: Verdana,Tahoma;font-size: 13px;line-height: 20px;text-align: justify">This mistake is because while hyper-linking, he didn&#8217;t put the <em>&#8220;http://&#8221; </em>before <em>&#8220;www.godaddy.com&#8221;</em>. So the web-browser thi</span><span style="color: #111111;font-family: Verdana,Tahoma;font-size: 13px;line-height: 20px;text-align: justify">nks that <em>www.godaddy.com</em> is a directory in DevilsWorkshop.</span>

### Spelling Mistake&#8217;s

This is the most common mistake seen in a blog. This is caused mainly if the blogger doesn&#8217;t check the spelling mistakes after he completes writing his article. This affects your readers. And mainly affects your non-English readers because if they want to translate your blog into their language. They use some Translators like Google Translator, Yahoo BabelFish etc. If that article consists of spelling mistakes, the Translator will not be able to translate the article. So, it affects the reading and also the non-English readers. So it annoys them.

### Irrelevant Advertisements

We are now seeing the kind of advertisements even in Tech Blogs which are not at all related to the content and also some of them are **CPA offers**. This really affects the traffic of the particular site.

<img class="size-full wp-image-15496 alignnone" style="border: grey 1px solid" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/10/jgl14r.png" alt="Irrelevant Keywords Used in a Tech Blog" width="493" height="80" />

This is mainly due to adding/using irrelevant keywords in the meta tags and also keyword stuffing. Mainly bloggers do this because if they use keywords like lung cancer, CPA etc., their websites will be displayed with the advertisements which pay a lot as compared to other advertisements.

Hope it helped you <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .
