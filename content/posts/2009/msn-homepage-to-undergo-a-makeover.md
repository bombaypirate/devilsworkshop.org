The <a href="http://www.msn.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msn.com', 'MSN homepage']);" >MSN homepage</a> will be undergoing some changes very soon. This won&#8217;t be just restricted to its style and format but also will have some added functionality. I looked it up on the <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/search/archive/2009/11/04/msn-and-bing-a-match-made-in-redmond.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/search/archive/2009/11/04/msn-and-bing-a-match-made-in-redmond.aspx', 'Bing blog']);" >Bing blog</a> which made the announcement. I used the <a href="http://www.msn.com/preview.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msn.com/preview.aspx', 'preview version']);" >preview version</a> of MSN homepage which will be available by next year.

### The Old and the New

*New Version (preview)*

  * The new version seems to be distinctly white and a lot less blue which has been the hallmark of the **MSN homepage** for over 10 years now. <span style="background-color: #ffffff">Also the logo looks different and minimalistic.</span>
  * The new version looked a lot less customizable but that is probably because it is still in preview mode and hence might not have all the functionalities.
  * From the homepage I can access a feed from **Hotmail**. That is not a novelty as I can do that with the old version too, but the new one allows me to get feeds from social networks like Windows Live, Facebook and Twitter.
  * I also found that Bing search has been integrated in a more wholesome way. The information with Bing search results will take into account the zip code you are living in. This will be a way to localize search content. MSN has had success with this by localizing weather and news updates by using the zip code of the person logged into the homepage.

*Soon to be Old Version*

Comparing the two, it is obvious that MSN is trying clean up it&#8217;s act and prefers to let people explore the website rather than bombarding them with information.
