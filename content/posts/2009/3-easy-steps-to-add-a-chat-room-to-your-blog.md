If you want to make your Chatroom available on all the pages/posts of the blog/website (hosted by WordPress) as a widget, instead of dedicating just one page for Chatroom, please see [Adding a Chatroom to wordpress as a widget][1]. (*If the link is not working, please [tell me][2])*

So you’ve decided to add chat functionality to your blog or website.

** **<a href="http://chatroll.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chatroll.com/', 'Chat rooms']);" >Chat rooms</a> are a great way to let your visitors meet each other and discuss your content. Chat creates a community feel and adds interactivity that can set your blog apart from the rest and keep your visitors coming back!

We’ve put together 3 easy-to-follow steps to embed a <a href="http://chatroll.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chatroll.com/', 'chat room']);" >chat room</a> in your blog or website using <a href="http://chatroll.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chatroll.com/', 'Chatroll']);" >Chatroll</a> <a href="http://chatroll.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chatroll.com/', 'live communities']);" >live communities</a>.

All Chatroll live communities can be easily used as embedded chat rooms. Here’s how:

  1. **Create a Chatroll live community to use for your chat room.**  
    Go to <a href="http://chatroll.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chatroll.com/', 'Chatroll']);" >Chatroll</a>, enter your community’s name in the “Name Your <a href="http://chatroll.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chatroll.com/', 'Live Community']);" >Live Community</a>…” box and click “Create”. Choose a name that fits with your blog, as this name will appear in the <a href="http://chatroll.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chatroll.com/', 'chat box']);" >chat box</a> title. Write an attractive and detailed description so that people can easily find your new Chatroll community (this will also help drive traffic to your blog).
  2. **Copy the embed code from the community’s home page**. On your live community’s home page (the page that appears after your community has been created) you’ll find a text box labeled ‘embed’ under the chat window. Click the embed code and copy it.
  3. **Paste the embed code in your blog or web site**. Paste the code where you would like the chat room to appear in your site. If you have a blog, you can either place the chat room in individual posts, or you can create a dedicated page on your blog to host the chat.

(<span style="color: red;font-weight: bold">IMPORTANT</span>: If you are using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/', 'WordPress']);" >WordPress</a> Visual Editor, or other visual editors, make sure to switch to HTML editor mode, otherwise WordPress will remove the embed code! This is a <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/131103" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/support/topic/131103', 'known issue']);" >known issue</a> with WordPress.)

You&#8217;ll see something like this&#8211;
