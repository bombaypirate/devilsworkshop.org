In a series of its ads, Microsoft is trying to show Google as a cluttered, irrelevant and confusing search engine. Even though the campaign doesn&#8217;t directly mention the name Google, but the target is pretty clear to all. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Bing’s ad campaign strategy

Microsoft is trying to center its campaign for the coming months on four major categories:

  * Travel
  * Shopping
  * Health
  * Local

Commercial spots are to be followed by online ad campaigns. Radio advertising will also be a part of the traditional [advertising][2] mix.

## The second phase of Bing advertising

After [Bing’s first TV commercial picked on Google for the collapse of the US economy][3], Bing’s advertizing has now entered its second phase.

Bing TV commercials are showcasing more dramatized versions of what it’s like when people interact with their friends, family and partners the way they do to a search engine. The ads would show how they get back responses that have the same words as their question, but nothing at all to do with what they asked.

The campaign develops a theme similar to the one Microsoft used in its earlier commercials directed at Apple.

Take a look at Bing’s recent TV spots. The ad calls today’s confusing and cluttered online search as &#8220;Search Overload Syndrome&#8221; and says Bing is the cure.
