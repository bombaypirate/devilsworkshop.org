Facebook and it&#8217;s features is so vast that it&#8217;s nearly impossible to use it hundred percent. But I found a very useful feature of it while accessing it. It is that you can hide your profile pic from all those who are not in your friend list.Isn&#8217;t it a cool feature which ensures a total privacy specially for female users because anyone can misuse their picture anywhere on the net. Also it ensures that nobody can ever make a fake profile of yours until and unless he&#8217;s your own friend. ðŸ˜€

An important feature with a simple implementation.Just go to,

Settings>Privacy Settings>>Search.

Or simply <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search', 'click here']);" >click here</a>. It redirects you to the same page.Now uncheck the first option that is &#8220;My profile picture&#8221;.You can also hide friend&#8217;s list, add as a friend link and send message link e.t.c.

For more clarity check the screen shot below:
