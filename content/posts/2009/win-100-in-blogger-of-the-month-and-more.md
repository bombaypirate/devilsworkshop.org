Blogger of the month is our new initiative to encourage good blogging standards and help new bloggers improve their blogging skills.

Starting this month, things will be changed for DW guest bloggers forever!

### First, the story so far&#8230;

More than a year ago back Devils Workshop opened for guest bloggers, with a difference. Unlike many other blogs where you submit your posts as guest only, Devils Workshop offered dedicate login to all guest authors treating them as co-bloggers, making sure they get proper credit and exposure for their work! One step ahead, we appreciated your efforts and [opened revenue sharing program][1] so that you can get paid for your posts transparently.

Even though revenue sharing took away all the focus, main motive behind community blogging was to create a system where experienced editors like [Swati][2] and [Deepak][3] can spend time on improving blogging skills of new bloggers. But with volume of guest posts Devils Workshop receives, managing things manually was too painful.

Thanks to our coder Radhe, who created a new plugin for wordpress MU, which makes things easier for our editors&#8217; team. They can find info about you easily, communicate with you in single click and most importantly can rate posts using different parameters.

The plugin is right now under testing cycle but it will take care of old posts as well. Hopefully, our editors will get a chance to use it by tomorrow. As this plugin interface will be accessible to editors and admins only, we have decided to give you a sneak preview of how things will look like. Below is a box added on post-editor screen *(available to editor team only)*.

Enough about plugin for now. Lets move to main course! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Bloggers of The Month&#8230;

As you can see above all guest posts will get rating. Editors will give points based on many factors.

  * **English** &#8211; be kind enough to run spell-check atleast. Use windows live editor for blogging. üòâ
  * **Presentation** &#8211; Use headers like h2/h3 to highlight sections of your articles. Add screenshots wherever possible! Break posts in small paragraphs. Things like this will be considered.
  * **Ethics** &#8211; Spend some-time on linking back to other sources you may use in post. Do not excessively promote anything particularly. We hate links that open in new tab or window. Do not force or irritate visitors!
  * **Tools **&#8211; Use blogging tools that generate nice markups and respect web-standards. We recommend using online wordpress post editor or [windows live editor][4]. Never use Microsoft word!

### Post Topic

This is one factor that will be considered most. A user posting a tutorial or nice post like [posts in &#8216;featured&#8217; category][5] will definitely gets more points. Do not look at my announcement posts in featured category. üòâ

Important thing to consider is that, write quality article! One article like [this][6] will definitely get more points than **10** news or review posts. So spend time on writing good quality and **original** article. **Let me repeat.. Original articles please! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />**

Actually there is nothing wrong in covering news as long as you add your analytical views to it. Lazy people copying news with copied screenshots will not get any points!

### Comments and accountability!

Many time we notice people just come on DW to write one guest post and get a backlink to their blog! Well, we do not have problem with giving link juice and whatever else we can give to our fellow bloggers but what hurt us that some guest bloggers do not answers comments and queries asked by visitors.

So we made our ranking algorithm consider accountability while answering comments. So always answer a question asked on your post. If you don&#8217;t know the answer, let your visitor know. Don&#8217;t keep them waiting!

## Reward&#8230;

In addition to direct revenue from ads running on your posts, **you can win $100 monthly prize!** We are planning to add more rewards and prizes.

Apart from consistent ad revenue and chance to win big monthly prize, most importantly, you will get free suggestions & feedback about your blogging skills. This will help you in long run! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

We have more exciting plans but we will unveil them on right time! üòâ

For time being, if you haven&#8217;t joined DW as blogger join it and start posting.

Those who are already in, don&#8217;t forget to update your profile!

**P.S.** This month we will be celebrating 3rd anniversary of DW. Stay tuned for more surprises throughout the month! üòâ
