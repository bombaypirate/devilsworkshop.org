Its comparison with Apple’s iconic iPhone is inevitable.

I think, Palm Pre is a legit challenger to the iPhone. Some are already claiming it to be an iPhone killer. iPhone fanatics, however, think otherwise.

### Reasons why I think Palm Pre will create its own niche:

  1. Apple has shown the world that instead of confusing the customers with array of features, focus on limited features and provide complete narrow experience.
  2. Even Steve Jobs keynote too the Press had revolved around on few features only like: Music, Video , Call simplicity (many would agree that having a call conference has never been this easy!)
  3. People do frown on the absence of many features like camera features (only 2 mega pixel? Come on! Nokia’s low end mobile does better than that), Bluetooth file transfer etc.
  4. Palm with its new management has shown some re-incarnated spirit by reverting to what they were i.e., innovating mobile platform.
  5. Palm unveiled the new mobile operating system they will be using henceforth, called WebOS . Palm claims developers can create applications with *html *and *css  &#8211; *no new language has to be adopted (there is a hot debate going on this right now on how viable is this, although Palm has showcased it Mojo SDK which is yet to be tested and seen)
  6. Like iPhone, Pre too uses multi touch (Tim Cook , Interim CEO of Apple had clearly given a hint that a legal war might be very well in waiting but guess we have to wait how that tide turns out ) and any one who has used multi touch would tell you how superior it feels as compared to other touch screens.
  7. It also has a removable battery and physical Qwerty keyboard that many users were craving for.

### There are things that go against Palm too, like:

  * Their consumers&#8217; lost faith
  * Current financial woes
  * Ever increasing competition

But if every thing goes right, we could have a new exciting mobile platform in waiting. For consumers, I&#8217;d say, bring it on. More the competition&#8230; the merrier!
