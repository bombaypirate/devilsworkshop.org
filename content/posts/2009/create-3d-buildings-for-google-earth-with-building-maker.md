Have you ever killed time on <a href="http://earth.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://earth.google.com/', 'Google Earth']);" >Google Earth</a>? I do pass my time looking up cities all over the world which I don&#8217;t think I can afford to visit. One of the great features of **Google Earth** are the 3D buildings they have. This gives you a 3 dimensional birds eye view of monuments and famous buildings across the world.

### <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html', 'Google Building Maker']);" >Google Building Maker</a>

  * With **Google Building Maker** you can choose a building from **Google Earth&#8217;s** interface and create a 3 dimensional model of it.
  * It is quite simple. I needed to visit the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html', 'Building Maker']);" >Building Maker</a> website. Sign in with my Google Id and select the city in which I wanted to create my 3D building.
  * Building Maker comes with a host of shapes and sizes in 3D forms which can be called building blocks. Using 6 different pictures provided by Google a decent 3D model can be made.
  * Once that is done, the 3D model is up for review and if it is good enough the model is included in Google Earth with credits. ðŸ˜‰

There are still some questions being asked on why someone would invest valuable time on **Building Maker** when there is not payout. Also some have dubbed building maker as a way for Google Earth to get their work done free. I have to agree with this notion as what might be just fun and entertaining for me and you might end up making short work of 3D mapping for Google Earth.

*Here is a video which pretty much sums up Building Maker.*
