It has been a couple of months since I really started using Twitter regularly and hence the number of people and organizations I follow have gone up dramatically.

Sometimes it is quite difficult to stay up to date with all the links that are sent out by people and in the process might lose out on a vital update. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

But today I came across a tweet thanks to following <a href="http://twitter.com/googlereader" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/googlereader', 'Google Reader']);" >Google Reader</a> on Twitter which recommended using <a href="http://www.readtwit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.readtwit.com/', 'ReadTwit']);" >ReadTwit</a> a website that basically transforms the links sent by people I follow into RSS format.

It is a website with the tag-line &#8220;Links from your Twitter feed in clean RSS format&#8221; and it does exactly that.

### How to subscribe ?

  * For obvious reasons you need a Twitter account and then need to visit the homepage of <a href="http://www.readtwit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.readtwit.com/', 'ReadTwit']);" >ReadTwit</a>. Then click on &#8216;Get Fed&#8217;.
  * Next you sign-in with your Twitter account.
  * And Finally choose the RSS reader you want. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Now you are ready to follow 100s of updates and links everyday on Twitter a lot more effectively ðŸ˜‰
