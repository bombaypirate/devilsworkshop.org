A couple of weeks ago [Sriganesh][1] had announced the contest for giving away 7 licence codes for [Kaspersky Internet Security 2010][2]. In all there were 31 valid comments who stood a chance to win one of the 7 license codes.

### Random.org used for picking winners

We used Random.org/lists for picking our seven winners. We entered all the entries in Random.org as a list (as shown in the image below).
