**With this plug in you could do the following:**

  * Use specific themes for specific devices / mobile browsers, such as iPhone, Opera Mini, Windows CE Mobile and other generic handset browsers.
  * Theme designers can create custom mobile themes for WordPress blogs using this plugin.

Up until the release of MobilePress, there was no plugin that offered the ability to render a WordPress Blog on a mobile device, while at the same time giving the user the ability to use a well-designed theme. This solution comes completely free of ads, and there are no backlinks to worry about either. What you see is what you get.

### Installation steps

  * Upload the MobilePress directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
  * Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
  * If you are using a caching plugin (ie, wp-supercache), clear your cache now.
  * If you plan on using custom themes, or wish to specify a custom title/description for your mobile blog, you can set these in the MobilePress admin panel.  
    That’s it, you’re good to go!

So, go ahead, give your weblog more exposure and outreach.
