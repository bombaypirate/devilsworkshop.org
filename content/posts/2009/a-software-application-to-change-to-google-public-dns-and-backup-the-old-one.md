excerpt: |
  I am sure almost everyone reading our blog is aware of Google's Public DNS service. It is a faster way for looking to make DNS lookups while you use the internet.  A day later there were many blog posts across the internet describing how to change from your ISP's DNS address to Google's Public DNS.
  
  I came across a software application which does that with a couple of clicks.
  
  It changes your DNS servers to Google Public DNS and backs up the old DNS address you were using.
  With another click you can restore your ISP's DNS address. ;-)
  Here is a screenshot of the me using Google DNS Helper software.
