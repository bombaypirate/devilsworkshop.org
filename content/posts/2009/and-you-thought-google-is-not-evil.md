title: And you thought Google is not Evil!

  One thing that caught the imagination of a lot of Google lovers is that Google said that their motto was not to be evil like Microsoft. Google often spoke of the guarding against becoming another Microsoft, which means not to look at ways and means to kill the competition but just outperform them technically.
  
  With a number of Anti-Trust lawsuits against Microsoft for breaking rules to finish off Netscape, "Evil" was a word which became almost synonymous with Microsoft.

One thing that caught the imagination of a lot of Google lovers is that Google said that their motto was not to be evil like Microsoft. Google often spoke of the guarding against becoming another Microsoft, which means not to look at ways and means to kill the competition but just outperform them technically.

With a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#Anti-competitive" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#Anti-competitive', 'Anti-Trust lawsuits against Microsoft']);" >Anti-Trust lawsuits against Microsoft</a> for breaking rules to finish off **Netscape**, &#8220;**Evil**&#8221; was a word which became almost synonymous with Microsoft.

Recently Google had become very aggressive with it&#8217;s marketing strategy especially when it comes to sponsored links and search related promotions.

I came across a great post by Aaron Wall at <a href="http://www.seobook.com/excuse-me-where-did-googles-organic-search-results-go" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.seobook.com/excuse-me-where-did-googles-organic-search-results-go', 'Seo Book']);" >Seo Book</a> who has also posted an image of the search results showing how Google has tried to hog all the attention to the extent the organic search results almost do not show.

The image shows that the Organic Listing of links by Google Search hardly shows up with the whole page almost full of either Google Ads, Google Map Promotion Ads and sponsored links.

### Has Google become Evil?

So what do you think? Has Google become the Evil monster it so religiously tried not to become? Will all large companies become self-serving and become monopolistic? The temptation is huge for Google to try and make someone using their search engine to stay on a Google service or click on advertisement link. Let me know what you think about this with your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
