**Mozilla Firefox** will be watched quite closely since now more than 1 in 4 people use the **Firefox** browser. The browser wars are back with **Chrome browser** leap frogging over **Safari** and is now the 3rd most used browser.

**[Firefox 3.6][1] beta** version has had a new upgrade and I thought I would let your know what is new with this version. If you already have **Firefox 3.6**, the new upgrade will be done automatically from your browser. If you are using a version lower than **Firefox 3.6** you might want to download it from their <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html', 'beta website']);" >beta website</a>.

  * The new upgrade support **HTML 5 File API**. This means its possible for allowing user to select a local file using HTML. This means it can be done using HTML *input* element or using drag and drop.
  * Scripts will be run asynchronously which essentially makes the speed of the browser a lot faster. Even though I have not testing the browser for speed, but I did seem a marked difference in speed after I upgraded.
  * Firefox 3.6 will proactively alert you about out of date plugins.
  * It also promises better support for CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript.

I started using the upgraded browser and its been a few hours. I must say when opening multiple tabs I found it better than **Chrome**. I usually end up opening over 10 tabs. Also there has not been a single crash. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

It is still early days but it&#8217;s definite that **Firefox** will keep eating into **Internet Explorer&#8217;s** market share right through **December**.

Let me know if you have more details and interesting facts about **Firefox 3.6** through **your comments**.
