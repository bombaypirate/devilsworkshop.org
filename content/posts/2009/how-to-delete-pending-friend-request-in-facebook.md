Most of the Facebook users still think that they don&#8217;t have an option of deleting &#8216;pending friend requests&#8217; on Facebook i.e the friend requests that are sent by you but haven&#8217;t accepted or rejected (pending for approval) by the other user. Actually it&#8217;s possible and the way of doing that is quite simple too. Unlike orkut we can&#8217;t do that directly from the user&#8217;s profile, rather you have to go to your &#8216;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/friends/?filter=afp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/friends/?filter=afp', 'Friends']);" target="_self">Friends</a>&#8216; page. Just follow the steps given below,

  * Go to Friends>> All Friends from your homepage, given on the top nav bar.

  * From the given list find the person with &#8220;<span>Friend Request Pending&#8221;. The list is arranged in alphabitical order so it&#8217;s quite easy to find a particular user.</span>
  * <span>To delete the pending friend request, click on the cross sign (remove request button) given with the particular person&#8217;s name.</span>
