Here are some tricks and suggestions you may like. I&#8217;ve tested these on XP platform&#8230;.

**1. A VIRTUAL DIARY**

You want a quick diary on your pc, but dont want to install a separate program for this purpose. And writing notes in a word processor by giving date-time everytime isn&#8217;t a good idea.

  * Open &#8216;NOTEPAD&#8217;.
  * Type .LOG (remember .log or .Log wont work)

<img class="size-full wp-image-17754 alignnone" title="diary" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/diary.JPG" alt="diary" width="408" height="287" />

  * Save the file with any desired any name and close the notepad window.
  * Now everytime you will try to open this notepad file&#8230;.the current date and time will be already placed there. So, this way it&#8217;ll become a virtual diary.

**2. HIDE ONLY FILE-NAMES **

Consider, you have some bunch of files like photos or music files. Those are not private but you want to hide only their filenames from others. Its easy, just **hold down the &#8216;SHIFT&#8217; key while selecting &#8216;THUMBNAILS&#8217; view from &#8216;VIEW MENU**&#8216; of the window. Amused?? All names are gone.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17755" title="filenames" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/filenames.JPG" alt="filenames" width="587" height="502" />

Its cool, but only works when others dont know this trick. If  they already know then they will bring up the filenames by repeating the process again. Anyway it doesn&#8217;t hurt to try  at least.

**3. WIN ACTIVE DESKTOP**

<div>
  <div>
    Its a good idea to work on your PC and simultaneously check the current stock quotes, match scores or mail feeds. You don&#8217;t need to open another browser window for it. Just add a web item to your desktop by using Windows Active Desktop feature.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open display properties by right clicking on desktop and selecting &#8216;properties&#8217;
      </li>
      <li>
        Click &#8216;Desktop&#8217; tab then click on &#8216;Customize Desktop&#8230;&#8221; Button.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <img class="size-full wp-image-17757 alignnone" title="web" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/web.JPG" alt="web" width="426" height="248" />
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click on &#8216;Web&#8217; tab, select &#8216;New&#8217;. Here type the website url e.g. http://news.bbc.co.uk
      </li>
      <li>
        Click &#8216;OK&#8217;, let it synchronise&#8230;click &#8216;OK&#8217; twice and you are done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dont forget to mention the update interval so the page refreshes itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can put this web item anywhere on your desktop and be updated.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <strong>4. VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</strong>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <strong><br /> </strong>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    If you have a file or something which could be potentially dangerous to your PC and you have to run it. Then you should run it in virtual machine instead of directly. <em>Virtual Machine creates a virtual hardware platform on top of a software layer</em>. This way, if virus or worm tries to initialize, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it will only infect virtual machine and your OS remains safe..</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline"><br /> </span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span><img class="size-full wp-image-17759 alignnone" style="text-decoration: underline" title="260_vmware10" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/260_vmware10.jpg" alt="260_vmware10" width="400" height="299" /></span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span>In the above image you can see a virtual machine (VMware is used) is running XP environment upon Vista platform.</span>
  </div>
</div>

**5. RESTRICTIONS TO UNWANTED**

** **

**<span style="font-weight: normal">If you use Internet via your admin account then your PC have more chances to get infected by viruses or worms. Due to the fact that, <em>if a virus got installed during web surfing thru your admin account, virus will have full access to admin rights</em>. It can interfere with your security rules and internal configurations.</span>**

**<span style="font-weight: normal">Instead, opt using &#8216;Limited Account&#8217; to surf web, so the incoming worms will have limited rights, because OS restricts it to do admin activities.</span>**
