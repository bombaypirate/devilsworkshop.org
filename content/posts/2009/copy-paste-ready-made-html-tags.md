If you are using **HTML** to design your website then this <a href="http://html-ipsum.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://html-ipsum.com/', 'website']);" >website</a> would be quite useful. It basically makes a lot of HTML Tag code available with Latin based **Loren Ipsum** text as default.

<a href="http://html-ipsum.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://html-ipsum.com/', '']);" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18072" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="HTML_tag_default" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/HTML_tag_default.png" alt="HTML_tag_default" width="550" height="256" /></a>

  * This is for basic **HTML tags** that you might need while designing. Instead of typing it over and over you can use the website as a way to copy the code into your HTML editor.
  * It supports basics like Long Paragraph, Unordered list: Short and Long Items, Kitchen Sink, Example Form, unordered list Navigation and much more.
  * With just a click on the Title of the Tags, the code with default text is copied to clipboard.

It was created by theÂ legendary <a href="http://css-tricks.com/new-site-html-ipsum/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://css-tricks.com/new-site-html-ipsum/', 'Chris Coyier']);" >Chris Coyier</a>.Â Â I find it quite useful personally even though I am not a developer, as it does save a lot of time to add these ready made html codes into my posts. It is very useful to visualize how my post will look even before I start with the content. ðŸ˜‰
