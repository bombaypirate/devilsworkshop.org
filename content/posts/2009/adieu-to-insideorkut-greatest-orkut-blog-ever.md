One of the greatest and first blog dedicated to orkut &#8211; <a href="http://www.insideorkut.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.insideorkut.com/', 'InsideOrkut']);" >InsideOrkut</a> has been officially closed by its founder <a href="http://www.darnellclayton.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.darnellclayton.com/', 'Darnell Clayton']);" >Darnell Clayton</a>.

Darnell and his InsideOrkut inspired many geeks to start dedicated Orkut blogs. <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=6090387655098571394" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=6090387655098571394', 'Gaurav Dua&#8217;s']);" >Gaurav Dua&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.orkutplus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutplus.net/', 'OrkutPlus']);" >OrkutPlus</a> is most notable of all of them. Darnell was the first person to tell me to go for professional blogging. I am really grateful to Darnell for his suggestions which transformed my life.

Darnell Clayton will be now continuing his blogging tryst at his personal website(blog) &#8211; <a href="http://www.darnellclayton.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.darnellclayton.com/', 'DarnellClayton.com']);" >DarnellClayton.com</a> and <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/author/hiddennook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blogherald.com/author/hiddennook/', 'blogherald']);" >blogherald</a> &#8211; a very famous blog.

Darnell Clayton is also a space enthusiast which is evident by his writing at <a href="http://www.colonyworlds.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.colonyworlds.com', 'colony world']);" >colony world</a>, a blog dedicated to highlight technological which will have impact on space exploration. Its also evident from his shared items in Google Reader! ðŸ˜‰

Once upon a time his Orkut scrapbook served a great pull of Orkut related tips & tricks. In fact, I wrote <a href="http://www.orkutfeeds.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutfeeds.com/', 'Orkutfeeds']);" >Orkutfeeds</a> to monitor scrapbook of people like Darnell!
