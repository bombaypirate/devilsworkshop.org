  In the past we saw many bugs and flaws in the world of Orkut – Google’s social networking site, but the one I am going to mention in this post is really too hilarious and I don’t understand what is making Orkut treat a Male as a Female.
</p>

  Actually few days ago, one of our reader – <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=14945857915678424535" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=14945857915678424535', 'Dnyanesh']);" >Dnyanesh</a> informed us about this bug, which treats his profile as a female’s profile and shows all updates accordingly. You can view clearly in the screenshot below, all the updates in ‘My updates’ section in his profile is showing “D?y????? ?k? ????lc???????g??k™ received a comment <strong>on her photo</strong>”

  I was totally confused when I received a mail from Dnyanesh mentioning this bug. For a moment I thought Dnyanesh must have mistakenly updated the sex status in his profile settings as ‘Female’ and I personally visited his <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=14945857915678424535" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile.aspx?uid=14945857915678424535', 'profile']);" >profile</a> to check his gender mentioned there, but found that his status is ‘Male’. Later I even asked him to recheck his sex status inside Orkut profile settings and then he confirmed me that his status was already set as ‘Male’. It is then I was confirmed that there is a <strong>bug </strong>in Orkut which is treating Male profiles as Female profile. There may be even chances that Orkut must be treating them vice-versa (female profile as male profile).

  I have already reported this bug to Orkut, meanwhile if you come across this <strong>hilarious bug</strong> in your status message too, then you are requested not to panic 😉 Also do let us know, if you too have come across such funny bug.
