If you author a blog on Blogger, then this might interest you! Google has added one more gadget to its toolbox – a Custom Search AJAX gadget available to all Blogger users. Now your older blog posts no longer have to be considered lost. This gadget will help expand the search capabilities of your blog and hopefully giving your readers a better search experience.

This gadget can be configured in just a few clicks to help your readers search for information like blog posts, linked web pages and linked sites from the sidebar, etc., all in one go.

The good part is that the search results displayed using this gadget will show inline and match the look and feel of your own blog.

### **The gadget enables you to perform 3 kinds of searches:**
