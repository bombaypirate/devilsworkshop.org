  Most of my friends ask me "how should we optimize our blogs for a better PR"? To be strictly honest, it's not that easy but, you can still optimize your blog by maximizing Backlinks and Nofollow links on your page. This should definitely increase the rank to some extent.

To be strictly honest, it&#8217;s not that easy but, you can still optimize your blog by maximizing **Backlinks **and **Nofollow links **on your page. This should definitely increase the rank to some extent.

### **What is &#8216;NoFollow&#8217; & how should it be used?**

Well, **rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; **is a great wayÂ  to optimize your blog or website. This allows web masters to control your page rank from over flow from your blog to other blogs and websites!! Links that have rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; in the anchor text never pass the page rank to the linked page, thus control the overflow of your page rank.

#### If you are confused, let me give you an example&#8230;

  * **DoFollow Link**:

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <a href=&#8221;http://www.newtechnologyinfo.com&#8221; >New technology Info</a>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  (This passed PR from this page to the linked page)
</p>

  * **NoFollow Link**:

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <a href=&#8221;http://www.newtechnologyinfo.com&#8221; <strong>rel=&#8217;NoFollow&#8217;</strong>>New technology Info</a>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  (This did not pass PR from this page to the linked page)
</p>

  * **Alternate to Nofollow (Applies for Web Pages):** There are two more alternatives that are available for using Nofollow:

<ul style="padding-left: 120px">
  <li>
    The first one is to use meta tags with nofollow,
  </li>
  <li>
    And the other alternate is to restrict your robots.txt file not to follow your pages.
  </li>
</ul>

**To restrict a URL, you can use following syntax:**

<pre><code class="no-highlight">Directories
User-agent: *
Disallow: URL of the page to restrict</code></pre>

**To restrict a file you can use following syntax:**

<pre><code class="no-highlight">Disallow: /Myfile.txt</code></pre>

If you have any further doubts, you can just <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=96569" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=96569', 'link to this page by clicking here to find more information']);" target="_self">link to this page by clicking here to find more information</a>.<a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=96569" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=96569', '\n']);" target="_self"><br /> </a>
