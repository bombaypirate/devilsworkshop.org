  In our <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/get-web-hosting-for-1-for-an-year-valentine-offer/" target="_blank">last post</a> we posted about a hosting offer by <a href="http://www.surpasshosting.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.surpasshosting.com', 'Surpass Hosting']);" target="_blank">Surpass Hosting</a>, that came out with a valentines day offer and started offering 1 year hosting with 500 GB of disk space just for just $1 (more about the offer is <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/get-web-hosting-for-1-for-an-year-valentine-offer/" target="_blank">here</a>). There are Valentines Day promotions going on in many other hosting companies too, so why should our favorite host – DreamHost be left behind in the race?

  <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dreamhost.com', '']);" ><img class="wp-image-50755" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;float: none;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;border-right-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/dreamhost-logo1.png" border="0" alt="dreamhost_logo" width="293" height="97" /></a> As many of you wanted, DreamHost too, has come up with an exciting promotion on this occasion wherein you get a discount of upto 92% in their 1 Year unlimited hosting plans. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  Again this offer is simply awesome, but I guess, this time too I will have to miss this offer because I don’t have a credit card and DreamHost accepts payment only via Google checkout that needs a credit card. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But guys like me not having a credit card can go for <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/get-web-hosting-for-1-for-an-year-valentine-offer/">surpass hosting</a> that accepts PayPal payment. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
