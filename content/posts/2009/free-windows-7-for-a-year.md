Next week you could download Windows 7 and use it till 2010. This is significantly longer than the timeframe it had set for Windows Vista&#8217;s candidate releases that remained fully functional for some eight months only.

The general public can download Windows 7 starting May 5, 2009 that will not expire until June 1, 2010. MSDN and TechNet subscribers however were slated for the download on April 30. Apparently, Microsoft’s download sites for both services were overloaded.

### Free Windows 7 for over a year? But why?

We don’t know yet. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t explained why. Well may be it is a marketing strategy or a genuine attempt to get users feedback.

I am quite exited about the release. Let’s just wait and watch!
