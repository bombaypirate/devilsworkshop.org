Although the news (spotted by <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/05/facebook-video-chat/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/05/facebook-video-chat/', 'allFacebook']);" >allFacebook</a>) is not a confirmed one yet, still, the notification messages visible in Facebook’s code indicate a possibility. The notification messages include: “Waiting for your friend”, “Video call denied.”, “Incoming call”, and “Loading video call”.

With a video chat service, Facebook will definitely keep its users on the site for longer. Facebook is aiming to be the single place for all online communication – messaging, photo sharing, online status updates and instant messaging… now maybe even video chatting.

I think it’ll be a pretty good move and a logical next step, if Facebook does actually come up with a feature like that. Earlier this week Facebook also upgraded their messaging system to make the most of friend list filters.

They seem to be upto someting. Let’s just wait and watch.
