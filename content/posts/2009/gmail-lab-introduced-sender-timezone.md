<span style="font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 12px;font-weight: normal">Gmail Labs recently introduced a new features &#8211; &#8220;Sender TimeZone&#8221;.</span><br /></span>

<span style="font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold">Sender TimeZone</span>

I deal with many clients from all over the world on daily basis. Most of the time it makes sense to know what time it is in clients timezone. Until now, I was using set of different timezone clocks on my Mac&#8217;s Dashboard and cellphones.

A simple use case can be like this. You get a mail from client in which he says, &#8220;*I will send you **documents** soon&#8221;*. Now if its morn there, you may expect ***documents*** in few hours. If its already midnight there, you will probably get ***documents*** aleast 10-12 hours later, i.e. on next working day!

To activate this feature, simple go to **Gmail >> Settings >> Labs** and look for **Sender Time Zone.** You can consider using browsers search feature to find it quickly!

**Screenshot:**

As you can see there is extra line **&#8220;sender-time&#8221;** is displayed in email header now. Also at the end there is a red icon. It turns green if current time in sender zone is between **9AM to 6PM**.
