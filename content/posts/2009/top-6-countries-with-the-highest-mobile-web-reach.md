Because of this, cell phones are a natural fit for social networks. A recent research study from Neilson Online tells us that social networks have the greatest mobile web reach in the UK and the US. In the UK, close to 2 million mobile web users visit a social network through their cell phone, while in the US, some 10.6 million people. Reports from end of 2008 indicate that these numbers have increased a great deal as compared to last year with 249% spike in the UK and 156% spike in the US.

[Facebook is the worldâ€™s most popular social network][1] via PCs, laptops, and even cell phones. Facebook is visited by every third person out of ten people online across the world.

Here is the list of top 6 countries with the highest mobile web reach:

**1. UK (22.7 %)**

**2. US (19.2 %) **

**3. France (12.3 %)**

**4. Italy (10.6 %)**

**5. Spain (10.6 %)**

**6. Germany (6.6 %)**

After the launch of the [3G iPhone][2], Facebook took over MySpace in mobile usage in the US. Almost 3 million cell phone users in the US were texting Facebook on a regular basis.
