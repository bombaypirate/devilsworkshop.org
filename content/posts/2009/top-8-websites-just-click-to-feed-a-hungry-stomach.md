## **Here are some facts by <a href="http://www.wfp.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wfp.org', 'WFP']);" >WFP</a>: &#8211;**

  * 1.02 billion people do not have enough to eat &#8211; more than the populations of USA, Canada and the European Union.
  * 25,000 people (adults and children) die every day from hunger and related causes.
  * 65 percent  of the world&#8217;s hungry live in only seven countries: India, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia.
  * Every six seconds a child dies because of hunger and related causes.

## **Can we feed the hungry via Internet?**

**Yes, we can help the cause without any cost.** There are a bunch of websites that can make this happen. The concept behind this is simple- when we click a button on these sites, their sponsors provide funds or food to the poor hungry people.

## **Here goes the list :-**

<a href="http://www.bhookh.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bhookh.com/', '']);" ><img class="size-full wp-image-11012 alignright" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/bhookh.gif" alt="bhookh" width="110" height="97" /></a>**1.** **<a href="http://www.bhookh.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bhookh.com/', 'Bhookh']);" >Bhookh</a>**(meaning hungry) is the India’s first online activism site which creates awareness about hunger and provides food to the poor hungry people which is paid by their sponsors.

**2.** **<a href="http://searchtoaid.org/ClickToFeed.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://searchtoaid.org/ClickToFeed.html', 'Search To Aid']);" >Search To Aid</a>** is a search engine powered by Google where you can help to generate donations for the hungry around the world. It also has a separate page with a button “click to feed”. The food is paid by Google and other sponsors in their site which is sent to UN World Food Program.

<a href="http://www.freerice.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freerice.com/', '']);" ><img class="size-full wp-image-11014 alignright" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/freericelogo2.gif" alt="freericelogo" width="120" height="84" /></a>**3.** <a href="http://www.freerice.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freerice.com/', 'FreeRice ']);" ><strong>FreeRice</strong> </a>is an interesting way to help the poor hungry people. We have to play a vocabulary game in the site. For every correct answer 10 grains of rice is provided to UN World Food Program. This also helps us to improve our vocabulary.
