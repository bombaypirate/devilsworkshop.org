If you have a Facebook account, then be a little careful. There has been a major spur of phishing attacks on Facebook to steal usernames and passwords and spam your friends.

## **How is it being done?**

Facebook’s mail system is being used by the attackers to send messages to the users, enticing them to go to &#8211; **fbaction.net **&#8211; a site that duplicates Facebook’s log-in screen.

</p>

The word has been around that Facebook has blocked this URL and this has hopefully brought an end to the entire nuisance.

## **Better safe than sorry…**

It is still very important that we **REMEMBER NOT TO LOG into a page that claims to be “Facebook” unless the URL is <a href="http://www.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com', 'www.facebook.com']);" >www.facebook.com</a>. **Wouldn&#8217;t hurt being just a little extra-cautious!
