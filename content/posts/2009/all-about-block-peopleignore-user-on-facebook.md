&#8220;Block people&#8221; is one of the most advanced feature by Facebook. There are 300 million Facebook users now but still mostly aren&#8217;t aware of this &#8220;block people&#8221; option and they don&#8217;t even know that what happens when you ignore somebody on Facebook. Don&#8217;t worry we have all your answers, after all you are on FacebooKnol üòâ

### How to ignore/block someone on Facebook?

Well there are two ways of doing that,

**Method 1:**

To ignore somebody on Facebook, simply <a href="https://register.facebook.com/privacy/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://register.facebook.com/privacy/', 'click here(or go to your privacy settings)']);" target="_self">click here(or go to your privacy settings)</a> and add either the name or the e-mail id you want to block in the box given below on that page and click &#8220;block&#8221;.

(check the screen shot below for more clarification)

**Method 2:**

You can also ignore somebody directly by visiting his/her profile. To do so, you first have to delete that person and then click &#8220;Report/Block this person&#8221;. Check &#8220;block this person&#8221; and click submit.You can also report a person for any particular reason.

</p>

### What happens when I &#8220;Block People&#8221; on Facebook?

Blocking users on Facebook is much more advanced than &#8220;ignore user&#8221; option of Orkut. If you block someone on Facebook he/she won&#8217;t be able to,

  * See your profile on Facebook search results.
  * Either open your profile, if the ignored person is having a bookmark of your profile, that will be automatically re-directed to his/her homepage.
  * Send pokes/message or any friend request in future.
  * See your comments in public pages.
  * See you in anybody&#8217;s friends list.

Obviously that&#8217;s a very good feature and important too in order to make Facebook clean.

### Blocked person is sending me messages using fake profiles, what should I do?

Well in that case simple make your profile invisible, that means only you will be able to see other Facebook profiles and nobody can access your profile. Read &#8220;**<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/set-your-profile-search-visibility-on-facebook/" target="_self">Set Your Profile Search Visibility on Facebook</a>&#8221; **for more information related to it.

So make facebook beautiful with &#8220;Block People&#8221; option and make Facebook better with <a href="http://www.facebooknol.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com', 'FacebooKnol']);" target="_self">FacebooKnol</a>. üòâ
