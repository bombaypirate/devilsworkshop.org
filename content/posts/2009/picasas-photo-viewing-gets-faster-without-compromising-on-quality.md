Picasa Web Albums make it easy for you to organize and edit your digital photos,and then create online albums to share with friends, family, and the world. However, when it comes to picture viewing, it takes forever to view the high resolution pictures.

Now Picasa gets better by accelerating its photo-viewing experience without compromising on quality! Google has tuned-up the Picasa Web Albums, which means that you could flip through photos a lot faster.

Try visiting an album and use the arrow keys as you flip through the snaps. You will notice a significant difference. Those of you on a reasonably decent broadband connection should be able to hold down one of the arrow keys and zip through the entire album at a pretty good clip, flip-book style. You could also take your browser to full-screen, and run a slideshow.

Give it a try and share your experience.
