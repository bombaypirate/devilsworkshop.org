&#8220;***What are you doing?&#8221;*** is the hallmark question with which, Twitter entered the internet and created a revolution in the way, people communicate. However, today, Twitter has changed the basic question from *What are you doing? *to *&#8220;What&#8217;s Happening?&#8221;*  
*<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-16977" style="border: 1px solid grey" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/twit.jpeg" alt="twit" width="274" height="186" />*

The reason that seconds the decision of twitter to do so, is largely said to be the change in social stuffs. The previous question was limited to you and your personal life. And according to the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/11/whats-happening.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.twitter.com/2009/11/whats-happening.html', 'twitter blog']);" >twitter blog</a>, &#8220;What are you doing&#8221; is no more, the relevant social question. When you&#8217;re sipping a coffee, and someone asks &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;, the answer comes, I&#8217;m sipping coffee. While, there are zillions of activities going around you about which you can tweet.

**Ok. Fine. But will it make a difference to me?**

In a way, it will. Before the new idea, all the tweeting was about personal statuses. But now, it will be more dynamic. Now the idea is not only to tweet about you but also about your surrounding and the events happening around you.

**The future?**

Presently, there are limits on content what you can pour over twitter. And most importantly, the 140 character limit. Maybe, in near future, Twitter may lift that limit. That will open the gates for new ideas to bloom. We can only wait and watch!

So, that was the idea behind changing the basic question from ***&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; ***to ***&#8220;What&#8217;s Happening?&#8221;***

Enjoy Tweeting ðŸ˜€
