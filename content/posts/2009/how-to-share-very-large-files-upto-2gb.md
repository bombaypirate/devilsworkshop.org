   had to share some home movies and pictures the total space it cornered was 1GB. It can be quite a tedious task to upload these files to a file sharing webs service. Most times such websites require registering and subscribing which obviously means spending money.  We Transfer info is a website which offers all that and also helps you to share the file with someone using their email address.

I had to share some home movies and pictures and the total space it cornered was 1GB. It can be quite a tedious task to upload these files to a file sharing webs service. Most times such websites require registering and subscribing which obviouslyÂ means spending money.

  * <a href="http://www.wetransfer.info/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wetransfer.info/', 'We Transfer info']);" ><strong>We Transfer info</strong></a> is a free service and you can add files upto 2GB
  * There is no need to **register** or **signup**. The files are not out in the open, they are stored and privacy is maintained thanks to the email addresses you provide.
  * The files are deleted after 2 weeks. So its a bit like parking your files. This means that this service is not ideal for backup of some files you might want to save online. It is suitable only for sharing of files as they are deleted after 2 weeks.

Go ahead and try out **<a href="http://www.wetransfer.info/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wetransfer.info/', 'We Transfer info']);" >We Transfer info</a>** and let me know what you think about it through your comments. ðŸ˜‰
