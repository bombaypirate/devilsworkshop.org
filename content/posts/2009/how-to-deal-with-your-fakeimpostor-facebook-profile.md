This post is for all those Facebook users who wants to report a fake or impostorÂ  profile. You can report any such Facebook profile that violates Facebook&#8217;s terms and conditions or Facebook&#8217;s statement of **Rights and Responsibilities**. There is a hair line difference between a fake and an impostor profile and here we need to understand that as the method for reporting both of them are slightly different.

We are using the term &#8216;Fake&#8217; here for the profiles that are using Fake profile name and if that name is yours (or anyone you know) then that will be an impostor profile that is if someone has created an account to impersonate or imitate you or someone else.

## When I can report?

You can report a fake profile to Facebook whenever anyone violates Facebook&#8217;s terms and conditions.That can be:

  * Profiles that impersonate you or someone else
  * Profiles that use your photos
  * Profiles that list a fake name
  * Profiles that do not represent a real person
  * Profiles that have been hacked

## How to report a Fake/Impostor profile?

If someone is impersonating you or someone else, go to his/her profile page an click on &#8220;Report/Block this person&#8221; link on the left bottom of the page.

Then check the &#8220;Report this person&#8221; box and use &#8220;impersonating you or someone else&#8221;. Enter the Impersonated profile link in the box given there and add required comment which is mandatory too.Finally click submit.

However if someone is using fake profile name then just use &#8220;Using a fake name&#8221; option in the report type and add comments in &#8220;What makes it fake&#8221; box, click submit.
