Hi all

This is Aditya and I am the new Editor in Chief at <a href="http://rtblogs.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com', 'rtBlogs']);" >rtBlogs</a> -rtCamp network of blogs. Â Was waiting for Rahul to introduce me but looking at how busy he is I thought I might as well do it myself. ðŸ˜‰

### About Me&#8230;

I have been a regular reader at Devilsworkshop and been a keen blogger. I dont usually blog about technology but have an addiction for view, news and opinions of anything tech related. Also passionate about reading about cricket and to be honest anything thats interesting. I noticed in the past month or so there has been a backlog of pending blog posts which I am trying to get them published on the site on a priority basis over the next day or two. I promise that once a new post is submitted I will review and publish it within 24 hours.

Hope I can live up to your expectations and we can get Devilsworkshop and other blogs back on track to its rightful glory.

I am available across all blogs and forums in the networks and feel free to contact me with any questions, comments and ideas you have. You can also email me at aditya.kane@rtcamp.com  
Also follow me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/bombaypirate" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/bombaypirate', '@bombaypirate ']);" >@bombaypirate </a>

### Just a reminder&#8230;

<a href="http://rtblogs.com/blogger-of-the-month/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com/blogger-of-the-month/', 'Blogger of the Month Contest']);" >Blogger of the Month Contest</a> is in its last week for this month. As fewer posts have been published this month there is a great chance for you to submit your posts before August ends and win the contest.

Keep Blogging&#8230; Keep Reading DW! ðŸ˜‰
