DW is an adsense revenue sharing site and such websites allow you to generate revenue through Adsense from the posts you contribute.These sites have high rankings and Google is calculating CPC based on the smart pricing method, where the statics of the page (where you got the click) is very important in determining the value of a click.The sites can surly increase your CPC. Also keep in mind that they have a lot of loyal readers who possibly reads your articles also (more readers=more clicks=more money). Rather than Just money, you can also earn some authority and experience through these posts!

Here I am compiling a list of 5 such sites, which allows Adsense revenue sharing on their posts.

1.[Devils Workshop (DW)][1]:

I think that there is no need to describe DW.You can earn money from your posts in DW through Adsense revenue sharing system and can also win $100 if you became the &#8216;Blogger of the Month&#8217;.My favorite site where i makes guest posts.

Another favorite of mine.It&#8217;s the best way to earn from adsense.Here, Instead of writing,  you have to share articles &#8211; i.e, this is a social bookmarking site like Digg and reddit.Through this site, You can promote your blog and also earn from adsense.You can even earn money by sharing the articles of others.

3.<a href="http://www.hubpages.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hubpages.com', 'Hubpages']);" >Hubpages</a> ;

One of my favorite.You want to create &#8216;hubs&#8217;  and can earn money from the ads displayed in the hubs.Each posts is a page which is called hubs.Most of all hubs are added on the front page of Google and is highly SEO optimized.

4.<a href="http://flixya.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flixya.com', 'Flixya']);" >Flixya</a> ;

It is an image, video, blog sharing site, which posts your ads on the shared pages and shares with you 100% Adsense revenue generated from the contents you share.

5.<a href="http://simpy.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://simpy.com', 'Simpy']);" >Simpy</a> ;

It is also another social bookmarking site just as SheToldMe.It also allows 100% Adsense revenue sharing to the contributors. Here too you can promote your blog or earn by other&#8217;s contents.

There are many other Adsense revenue sharing sites, which pays from 50%-100%. Anyway, this concept is accepted by Google and is the best way to make more money.

In my opinion, if you have an Adsense account you must checkout the DW and shetoldme.
