To celebrate the milestone, **Apple had announced Prizes worth US$ 13,746 for the one billionth download including**** **MacBook Pro and iPod Touch 32GB. Complete details <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/billion-app-countdown/rules.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/itunes/billion-app-countdown/rules.html', 'are here']);" >are here</a>.

So, I wonder, what are the types of applications that are popular amongst the community? I tried finding out the trends on the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://store.apple.com/us', 'App store']);" >App store</a> itself&#8230;

### The top 10 PAID applications across all categories:

  1. StickWars
  2. Flight Control
  3. Pocket God
  4. iHunt 3D
  5. ParkingLot
  6. Leaf Trombone
  7. Camera Zoom
  8. Tweetie
  9. Flick Fishing
 10. Playman Track

Interestingly, 7 out of 10 in the list are Gaming applications!

### The top 10 FREE applications across all categories:

  1. Heat Pad
  2. Catcha Mouse
  3. iDare
  4. Flood-It!
  5. F-MyLife
  6. Archers: Bowman&#8230;
  7. Dictionary.com
  8. Mini Golf 99 Ho&#8230;
  9. iMob 15 Respect&#8230;
 10. Galaga REMIX Lite

Maybe a coincidence, but even in the top free applications section, 7 out of top 10 are Gaming applications.

### My favorite application?

Other than “Gaming,” some other categories that caught my attention are: Medical, Photography, Healthcare & Fitness, Books and Lifestyle.

More than anything else now, I really want to buy an iPhone to try these applications out!
