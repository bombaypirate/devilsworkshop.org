Google is looking at us and penalizing link spammers. Is your website in danger of being blacklisted and banned from Google for link spam? Yes, No, Maybe???

<span style="background-color: #ffffff">If youâ€™re not 100% sure. Read the post below&#8230;&#8230;</span>

<p style="text-align: left">
  <strong>SEO</strong> link building is now one of the most done activity in any business/blog. The simple logic here is the back-link&#8217;s give you a higher PR (Page Rank) and PR makes you rank high in SERPS (Search Engine Results Page). After all a higher ranking will definitely gives you a hight traffic that implies more money.
</p>

Back-links really gives you 90% of your Google Rank and this is the reason that gave this much importance to it in business/blogging. Most of the people misunderstand it. Beginner&#8217;s should first know that not all back-links are good but some can actually hurt you than help you.

SEO Link-building is all about building links that are natural. Google did not design their ranking system to be manipulated. It was designed to reward good sites that get linked to it naturally. That&#8217;s why getting the right links can be incredibly difficult if you try and do it manually.

Unfortunately, you have to build in links these days otherwise you will not be competitive. If you sit around and wait for sites to link to you, you might wait forever. The good thing is that this also gives the &#8220;small guy&#8221; a fair shake to get good rankings in Google, Yahoo and M.S.N.

And coming to the topic here is a list as follows.

### 1:Mass Link Packages

Now a days people are selling Mass Link Packages which are not really worth a mention but drags you as the title says &#8220;**PR7 in 30 days**&#8220;**. **Mostly the site&#8217;s in this packages will be of the networks that don&#8217;t have traffic and have irrelevant information.

### 2: Link Exchanges

<span style="font-weight: normal">Back in the day, exchanging links was the main SEO link-building strategy. You link to me, I link to you and we both win. Right? Wrong! Google caught on to this when hundreds of link farms opened up. Google can easily trace reciprocal links and they simply don&#8217;t count for much anymore. Getting links from big link exchange networks can actually hurt your business.</span>

### 3: Linking From Non-Indexed Sites

<span style="font-weight: normal">Most people who spend hours building those free Back-links make the mistake of building links on non-indexed sites. For your back links to count, the page on which you have your link has to be indexed. Having links on non-indexed pages means nothing. It&#8217;s a waste of time and some really shocking thing is </span>s<span style="font-weight: normal">ome people sell those lists in forums.</span>

### 4: Not Using Anchor Text

<span style="font-weight: normal">At first this probably won&#8217;t sound too scary, but if you build 2,000 links without relevant anchor text your site can easily pass for a spam site that just gets random links. By using anchor text that is related to your site, it gives your links link-juice; meaning it makes your links relevant and increases the perceived value of each link. And this effects your website traffic because a SPAM site will be banned up to 5 years which affects your traffic.</span>

### 5: Inorganic links

<span style="font-weight: normal">As I mentioned earlier, Google designed the page rank system to work organically which means it should be built naturally. If you go and get 1000 links overnight from the same site then Google&#8217;s alarms will go off and you might land yourself in some Back-linking trouble with Google which may even BAN you.</span>
