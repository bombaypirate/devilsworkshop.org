excerpt: "A bit of bad news folks! Internet giant Yahoo! has finally closed GeoCities. Yahoo had bought GeoCities in the year 1999 for a whooping $4 Bn. During the 90's, this was one of the most visited sites on the web. But, the current users need not panic, as Yahoo has assured people that they will be able to access GeoCities until later this year."

Internet giant Yahoo! has finally closed GeoCities. Yahoo had bought GeoCities in the year 1999 for a whooping $4 Bn. During the 90&#8217;s, this was one of the most visited sites on the web. But, the current users need not panic, as Yahoo has assured people that they will be able to access GeoCities until later this year.

Yahoo is also encouraging all the current GeoCitiesers to migrate to their web hosting service!

Bye bye GeoCities&#8230;..!
