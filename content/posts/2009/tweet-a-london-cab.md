Using the micro-blogging site &#8211; Twitter, Richard Cudlip has started a &#8220;tweet a taxi&#8221; service <a href="http://twitter.com/tweetalondoncab" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/tweetalondoncab', '@tweetalondoncab']);" >@tweetalondoncab</a>. People in London are required to book a cab at least 30 minutes in advance. The service is available 24 X 7.

“Tweet a London Cab” service is a group of 30 drivers who met on the social networking site. All the 30 of them are licensed black cab drivers. Richard’s Twitter friends inspired him to start this service, who he said would frequently Tweet him to check if he was out in his cab.

Although they haven’t yet received many booking for the cab service, but it sure has gained a lot of popularity on Twitter with hundreds of followers in no time. They hope to expand eventually and cover the entire capital.

## Book a Taxi

  1. Log in to Twitter
  2. “Follow” the taxi service on Twitter
  3. Send a private message to make a booking (so that your location is not reveled publicly on the internet).
  4. You receive a reply from the taxi service and you can liaise directly with the driver, rather than through an office.

Not bad. This service might just catch up. Although picking up the phone to call a taxi is a much hassle-free process. But if you don’t have a cab service number already saved, searching for phone numbers for black cab drivers is definitely not easy.

The best part about Twitter is that most of the people can easily access it from their cell phones. It never quite hurts to have an alternative way of booking a cab.
