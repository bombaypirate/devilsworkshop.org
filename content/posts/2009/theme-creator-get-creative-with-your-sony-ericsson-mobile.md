### The 3-step wizard to design your mobile desktop:

** **

  1. Create your own color combinations by choosing your favorite color scheme from the automatic color combinations, the color wheel tool or by importing the saved color palettes.
  2. Decide on the graphic style by importing the background images of your choice, and animation for standby wallpaper, desktop and navigation screens
  3. Select the style using pre-defined shapes and screen areas.

> **Says Christopher David, head, developer and partner engagement, Sony Ericsson:**

> “With Themes Creator 4.0, you can use your phone as an extension of your personal style… It’s designed to enable you to make eye-catching themes that you can show off to your friends. You can now treat your ‘mobile desktop’ as a place to experiment and show your creative flair!”

  It’s easy to use and suits everyone &#8211; from a novice to a professional designer. You could choose from dynamic to intuitive animations based on Adobe Flash technology that vary according to the time of the day. You could also change the look according to the seasons. Not just that, you could also change the color to signal when you’re phone is running out of battery.
