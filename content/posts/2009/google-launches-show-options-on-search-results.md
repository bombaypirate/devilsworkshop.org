<p style="text-align: left">
  Once you click on the &#8220;Show options&#8221; link, the link changes to &#8220;<strong>Hide Options</strong>&#8221; as you can see in the screen shot below. This is a really cool feature that Google launched very recently to help its users find what they exactly want!<br /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8273" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/05/show-options-google2.png" alt="show-options-google2" width="428" height="373" /><br /> Please <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtirDMfcOKE" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtirDMfcOKE', 'watch this video to know more about &#8220;Show options link&#8221;']);" >watch this video to know more about &#8220;Show options link&#8221;</a> that appear on the right side of the Google search results!
