      For the last three years I have been using AVAST for my antivirus, Online-Armor for my firewall, and Webroots Spy Sweeper for my Spyware. With my subscriptions ending this month, I decided to search for something newer with all three products under one roof so to speak. I read very good reviews on VIPRE, as well as the firewall and spyware from you folks. I purchased a few days ago, and already I cannot believe just how smooth and how fast they all work. VIPRE is most impressive. It does EXACTLY what you said it would do. I see no slow down in my computer while I work on other things as it is running in the background. I couldn&#8217;t do that when AVAST was running. I always had to wait an hour or so or until the scan was done. Your price was also a lot cheaper than purchasing other individual or stand alone products, which in todays economy is very important. Thanks again, and please pass this message up the chain to the managers and supervisors. Keep up the good work and support. I appreciate it very much. Best
