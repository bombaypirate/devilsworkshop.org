### Test how safe you are from phishing attack‚Ä¶

More about phishing is posted below, but first <a href="http://www.paypal.com/fightphishing" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paypal.com/fightphishing', 'take ‚Äúfighting phishing‚Äù test by paypal']);" >take ‚Äúfighting phishing‚Äù test by paypal</a>. Its free and you don‚Äôt need any paypal account to take the that test.

It just asks you 5 simple question and if you can answer all of them right then you don‚Äôt need to read further! Although most questions uses paypal in its name, they are equally true with all major social networks, banks and other portals. So <a href="http://www.paypal.com/fightphishing" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paypal.com/fightphishing', 'go for test']);" >go for test</a> without any hesitation!

### Phishing Examples‚Ä¶

Now hopefully you are done with test, let me give you 2 simple examples of phishing via email‚Ä¶

  * You get an email from your favorite social network with from email id like *admin@facebook.com*, saying we are deleting inactive users as part of our annual maintenance program. In case you want to retain you account, please verify your account by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/', 'http://www.facebook.com/verify']);" >http://www.facebook.com/verify</a>
  * You get an email from your bank with from email id *admin@icicibank.com*, alerting you about an attempt to hack your account. As money is involved, you get panic! On next line, they say something like verify your account, blah blah! Again they give a link like <a href="http://www.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/', 'http://www.icicibank.com/verify']);" title="http://www.icicibank.com/">http://www.icicibank.com/verify</a>.

In both cases, from email address and target of links are forged! You can click on above facebook or icici links and see where it takes you! üòâ

I posted 5 tips sometime ago where you can save yourself from such fake email ids as well as misleading links. Also read tips posted by <a href="http://www.mobilegyaan.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mobilegyaan.com/', 'Deepak']);" >Deepak</a> while covering a recent <a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/news/beware-orkuteers-while-logging-into-orkut" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/news/beware-orkuteers-while-logging-into-orkut', 'phishing scam on Orkut']);" >phishing scam on Orkut</a>.

By the way, do let us know your score and any doubts you have against this rapidly growing scam on internet! Just for info, I scored 5/5! üòõ
