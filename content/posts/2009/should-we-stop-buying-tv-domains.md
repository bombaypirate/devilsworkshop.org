  The tiny South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu is in danger of sinking under water. The Prime Minister - Saufatu Sopoaga has been panicking and telling everyone that the sea levels are rising and Tuvalu can be the first victim of global warming.
  
  As we know already, Tuvalu has been earning money by selling access to its Internet domain - “.tv” since late 90's. But it now appears that since the island is doomed to sink beneath the ocean and no will longer exist as a nation, the domains could disappear with it too.

The Prime Minister &#8211; Saufatu Sopoaga has been panicking and telling everyone that the sea levels are rising and Tuvalu can be the first victim of global warming.

As we know already, Tuvalu has been earning money by selling access to its Internet domain &#8211; “.tv” since late 90&#8217;s. But it now appears that since the island is doomed to sink beneath the ocean and will no longer exist as a nation, the domains could disappear with it too.

Does this mean you should stop buying “.tv” domains?

That indeed is a good question, however, we don’t have a definite answer yet. Let’s hope for the best!

### Any Hope???

VeriSign spokesman Tom Galvin told <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2004-04-27-tuvalu_x.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2004-04-27-tuvalu_x.htm', 'USA Today']);" >USA Today</a> that a defunct country’s Internet domain lives on. For instance, you can still find addresses on .su — the domain for the Soviet Union. Tuvalu would not necessarily cease to exist. Apparently, the laws of the sea say that a country is a country, even if underwater.

### .tv Domain &#8211;  To Buy or Not To?

I’d say &#8211; hold your horses! Now is the time to wait and watch. There are other recommended domains you could go for, like, .COM, .NET and .INFO. If the island sinks, anything can happen!

Do share your thoughts on what you think.
