Before telling about that let&#8217;s see how can we find the first, second or any community we want. To do so just go to any community and copy the url from the adress bar. It should be like this,

http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Community?cmm=19587001

Now see the number cmm=19587001, that means this community is the 19587001th community created on Orkut. That means to find the 1st community it will be cmm=1

So the first community on Orkut is <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Community?cmm=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Community?cmm=1', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Community?cmm=1(Stanford University)']);" target="_self">http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Community?cmm=1(Stanford University)</a>which was created by <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile?uid=325082930226142255" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Profile?uid=325082930226142255', 'Orkut Buyukkokten']);" >Orkut Buyukkokten</a> who is the creator of Orkut website too. This community was created on January 19, 2004.

If you create a community right now then you will get a cmm nearly equal to 94301438 (as on 22nd september 2009). ðŸ˜‰
