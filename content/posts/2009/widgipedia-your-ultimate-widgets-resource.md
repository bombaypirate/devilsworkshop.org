As the name suggests, <a href="http://www.widgipedia.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.widgipedia.com/', 'Widgipedia']);" >Widgipedia</a> is a resource center for both users and developers of widgets and gadgets. The lack of collaborative resources to help developers increase their widget making knowledge led to the creation of <a href="http://www.widgipedia.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.widgipedia.com/', 'Widgipedia']);" >Widgipedia</a>. This site makes it easy for anyone to find the best widgets and gadgets.

It has a comprehensive catalog of Web widgets and desktop widgets (and gadgets) across all platforms. Developers can use Widgipedia to upload their creations, to collaborate with others, to learn or teach through tutorials, code samples, libraries and more.
