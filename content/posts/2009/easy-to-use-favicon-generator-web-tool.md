A lot of our readers are bloggers or want to start blogs. Some of them might be starting out and still struggle with tiny issues relating to the design of their blogs. One of these issues could be generating Favicons. I came across a website which generates **Favicons** out off any image file whose size is less than 100 Kb. ðŸ˜‰

### What is a Favicon?

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17483" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Devils Workshop Favicon" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/12/favicons_generator1.png" alt="Devils Workshop Favicon" width="375" height="296" />

**Favicon** is a very useful icon for your website which can give your website a sense of identity or even individuality. Most browsers today lookup for Favicons automatically. Favicons are mostly for cosmetic benefit of your website. It does not have any practical purpose except that it can make the website look professional. If you bookmark a particular page most times the browser automatically saves the **Favicon** of the website.

  * Just visit <a href="http://www.dagondesign.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dagondesign.com', 'Dagon Design']);" >Dagon Design</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/tools/favicon-generator-tool/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dagondesign.com/tools/favicon-generator-tool/', 'Favicon Generator tool']);" >Favicon Generator tool</a> and upload an image file. Make sure the image is something that is relevant to your website. The image should be less than 100 Kb is size. It supports JPG, PNG and GIF file formats for images. Resizing of the image into a icon is done automatically by the website.
  * After I selected the file, I needed to click on **Upload** and the Favicon of size 16X16 pixel was generated. It is given a random name so right click on the Favicon and save it on your computer with a desired name. The file extension of a favicon image is ***.ico.**
  * Now upload the **Favicon** image to the root directory of your public web space. Most web browsers will automatically look for it from the **root directory** and set that as your website&#8217;s Favicon. If that does not work use the **HTML code** given below in the **head section** for best support for all browsers to show your website&#8217;s Favicon. Make sure the code is included on all webpages on your website.

> <link rel=&#8221;icon&#8221; href=&#8221;http://example.com/favicon.ico&#8221; type=&#8221;image/x-icon&#8221;>  
> <link rel=&#8221;shortcut icon&#8221; href=&#8221;http://example.com/favicon.ico&#8221; type=&#8221;image/x-icon&#8221;>

&#8220;http://example.com/favicon.ico&#8221; is the address of where the image has been stored online. If you choose to store the Favicon image at some other website instead of your own site you can look up a list of [5 sites which host favicons for free][1].
