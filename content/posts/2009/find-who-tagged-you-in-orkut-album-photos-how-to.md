Unlike facebook, we don&#8217;t have a direct option of finding who tagged someone in photos as an update, Doesn&#8217;t matter if orkut&#8217;s most of the features are from facebook ðŸ˜› . But if you want to see who tagged you or your friend on orkut you can do so and it&#8217;s very simple too, just follow the below two steps.

  * Open that photo where you or your friend is tagged and find the word &#8220;Tagged people&#8221; just below the pic (as shown below in the screenshot).

  * Then move your cursor over the desired name and you will see a yellow coloured box which will show you the name of the creator of that particular tag.

The above screenshot clarifies most of the things, in this pic the profile of &#8220;Gauravjit Singh&#8221; is tagged by &#8220;Sauravjit admin Music &#8216;N&#8217; Lifestyle&#8221;
