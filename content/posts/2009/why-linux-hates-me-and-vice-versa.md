Earlier, I wrote about why <a href="http://www.callingallgeeks.org/out-of-all-oss-i-love-my-windows-the-most/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.callingallgeeks.org/out-of-all-oss-i-love-my-windows-the-most/', 'I love windows the most']);" >I love windows the most</a>. Today, I am writing about why Linux hates me. You may think how can an OS hate you? In fact, hate is a strong word, instead, let&#8217;s say it doesn&#8217;t really love me very much!

It all started the day I became a fan of Open Source softwares. I just love open source alternatives so much so that you&#8217;ll find me suggesting OSS to anyone who cares to listen. I even made a presentation on it for the purpose of my college project. Gravitating towards Linux was very natural. One day I got my hands on Ubuntu 7 and Fedora 9.<img class="size-medium wp-image-4881 aligncenter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/linux_penguin-300x225.jpg" alt="linux_penguin" width="300" height="225" />

Without wasting a breath, I inserted the live CD in the optical drive and my geek instincts sprung into action. Installation was the easy part. The nightmare began soon after. I have Dell Inspiron 1420 so there were driver issues. Wifi & sound cards did not work. I could live with the fact that my speakers were useless but tell me, what is the use of a laptop without wifi?

I tried and wasted 7 days but could not find wifi driver. Peace prevailed and I again reformatted my drive only to install a virtual copy of Linux using Sun VirtualBox on windows Vista. All seemed familiar. I sincerely hoped the feeling of Deja Vu will go away. Then came a bumper. The display resolution and mouse tracking were not proper in the virtual machine so I figured that installing VirtualBoxGuest Additions might relieve me of my sins.

It was a uphill task, unlike windows softwares, VB Guest Additions are not the easy to install, something Windows users are accustomed too. You need to open up Windows equivalent of command prompt &#8211; TERMINAL and get dirty with Sudo&#8230;.. $Sudo apt&#8230;.. Some geek stuff.

After some help of a YouTube video, finally Ubuntu was up and running. Then, I decided to install some software and then I got face to face with &#8220;Dependency Hell&#8221;. It turned out that in order to install one software I needed to install 5 dependency package. And no, I can&#8217;t just install them, I had to download them from the respective repositories (another fancy geeky stuff).

I almost gave up. Then as a last test of my patience, I downloaded Sun Studio One (now Java developers can smile wide), and I was given a rude shock as I couldn&#8217;t install it. I had to compile it from source code tar balls (another geeky word, woo!). Installing software isn&#8217;t a simple task as hitting &#8220;next&#8221; &#8220;next&#8221;&#8230; few times while installing Windows softwares.Â  Its a whole compilation process as different distros of Linux have different libraries!

In the end, I formatted the silly penguin. Hopping I&#8217;ll be back being a Windows loyalist. My startup crashed as Mr. GRUB Loader couldn&#8217;t find the Linux as I had formatted my partition. Now Beat that!

If you are a Linux noob then kindly remain so. But in my opinion, you&#8217;ll remain much more happier being a Windows Expert than being a Linux novice user.
