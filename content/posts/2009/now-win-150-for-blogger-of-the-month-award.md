### Why Blogger$ of the Month?

Well we at Devils Workshop conceived the idea of &#8216;Blogger of the Month&#8217; few months back to promote¬†the guest authors. The primary goal was to encourage new bloggers to write, and secondly to bring them appreciation in terms of exposure and¬†revenue. We promised to increase the cash prize and it&#8217;s distribution too. &#8220;Bloggers of the Month&#8221; is an exertion to keep that promise.

### What&#8217;s in Store for you?

Now we will select** best 3 amongst the guest authors instead of 1** previously. The breakdown will be **$75**, **$50** and **$25** to the first three guest authors in the ratings table respectively. The ratings again will be given by our Editors which will again be based on..

  * **English** &#8211; be generous to run spell-check atleast. Use windows live editor for blogging. üòâ
  * **Presentation** &#8211; Use headers like h2/h3 to highlight sections of your articles. Add screenshots wherever possible! Break posts in small paragraphs. Things like this will be considered.
  * **Ethics** &#8211; Spend some-time on linking back to other sources you may use in post. Do not excessively promote anything particularly. We hate links that open in new tab or window. Do not force or irritate visitors!
  * **Tools **&#8211; Use blogging tools that generate nice markups and respect web-standards. We recommend using online wordpress post editor or [windows live editor][1]. Never use Microsoft word!

Important thing to consider is to write quality article! Spend time on writing good quality and **original** article. Refrain from copy paste. *Include link and image credits if applicable*.

### What about posts published till now in November?

The contest will include the ratings given to posts published from *November 1st*, till date! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
