**Expected Specifications of NexusOne by Google**

  * **Nexus** will have a proximity sensor/light sensor along with a touch screen.
  * **Nexus One** will have Android running on it.
  * Specifications on a camera are not clear but it will support [**Google Goggles**][1] and hence it might come with a 5 MP camera.
  * It is expected to have WiFi Radio and Bluetooth.

### What does Nexus One mean for Google?

I have no doubt that Nexus One will give a pretty strong push to the **Android OS** but this does mean **Google** is shifting some of its focus from **internet** services and products to a **hardware** product.

**Microsoft** which had done the same by entering the market with **Xbox** and b have not made any major breakthrough in term of huge financial windfall. But they have much deeper pockets compared to **Google**.

I wonder if this will be a misadventure for **Google** because inspite of having their customized hardware and **Android OS**, Google will finally have to convince carriers about adopting the Nexus phone.

What do you think about this new development? If Google gets this right could we see a **Google Netbook** powered by **[Chromium OS][2]** in a few years?

Let me know your thoughts through **your comments**.
