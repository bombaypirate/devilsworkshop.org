title: In case of fire, DO NOT use Twitter!

excerpt: With the popularity of Twitter increasing by the day, there seems to be no limit to which people would stop to tweet an update. There was furious updating during the Mumbai 26/11 blasts, during the California earthquake (where the tweets came in earlier than CNN!) and many such related times. And so, in most cases, people now seem to rely on Twitter to call in time of emergency.
