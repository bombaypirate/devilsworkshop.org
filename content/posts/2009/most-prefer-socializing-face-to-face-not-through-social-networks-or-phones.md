Two-thirds of the respondents said that they don’t meet or interact with their friends as often as they would like.

  * As compared to men, women prefer face time 70 times more than using social networks.
  * Men only prefer face time 33 times more.
  * Overall, people prefer face time 44 times more than social networks.

### Actual Consumer Behavior

  * 65% of respondents, i.e., two-thirds of respondents agree that they don’t see their friends as often as they would like.
  * 9 % of respondents agree that they are addicted to social networks. This peaks at 21 % for the age bracket of 18-24 years).
  * 11 % of respondents between the age group of 18-24 years spent more than 4 hours per day on social networks.

### Additionally…
