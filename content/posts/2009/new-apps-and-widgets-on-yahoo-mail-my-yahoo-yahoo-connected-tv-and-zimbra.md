## What’s New?

### 1. Yahoo Mail Apps

Now you have more options with Yahoo Mail apps, allowing you to do all kinds of new things from your inbox.

  * Request or send money securely using **PayPal**
  * Edit pictures and share photo collages using **[Picnik][1]**
  * Email files as large as 100MB for free using **Zumo Drive******

If you’d like to try these out, click <a href="http://overview.mail.yahoo.com/applications" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://overview.mail.yahoo.com/applications', 'here']);" >here</a> and enter your Yahoo ID.

### 2. My Yahoo Apps

Some of the new My Yahoo apps available include:

  * **Mint.com:** to manage your finances, set budgets and get money-saving tips
  * **Food & Wine Pairing:** to find recipes, menus, wine reviews and recommended pairings
  * **Green Lifestyle:** to grow your green knowledge and help benefit the environment

To add these, go to “Add Content” and look for the “Open Apps” category in the <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/evt?type=contentstore" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://my.yahoo.com/evt?type=contentstore', 'My Yahoo! gallery']);" >My Yahoo! gallery</a>.

### 3. Yahoo Connected TV Widgets

In addition to Flickr, Twitter, USA Today Sports, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Weather, Internet-enabled TVs from Samsung and LG Electronics, etc., now Yahoo TV widgets also include:

  * **YouTube** to search and view video’s on your TV screen
  * **Showtime** to find information, schedules, interviews and short clips from popular Showtime offerings
  * **eBay (coming soon)** to get real-time updates, place bids, and monitor your favorite items on eBay

### 4. Yahoo’s Zimbra

Yahoo’s Zimbra is introducing a handful of new Zimlets to integrate new features in your email (similar to the Yahoo Mail apps).

  * Automatically save emails as documents
  * Drop sticky notes on messages
  * Handle expense reports with one click

Personally, I prefer Gmail over my Yahoo account, but this new stuff might just push me back!
