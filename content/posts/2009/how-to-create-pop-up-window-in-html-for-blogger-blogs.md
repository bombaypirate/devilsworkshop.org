Below is the method by which you can create a basic pop up which you can re-direct to any page you want.

All you need to make a pop-up in HTML is to copy the code given below and paste it where you want to give the link of pop-up.

**HTML CODE:**

<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?onuromjjmog" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?onuromjjmog', 'Click Here']);" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to download notepad file of the html code.

**CHANGES IN ABOVE CODE:**

Change the link http://www.devilsworkshop.org to the desired page you wants to open with your pop-up.

Change the desired width and height.

Change toolbar, statusbar, scrollbar e.t.c according to your requirements.

I think that was simple enough, for any further clarification kindly drop us a comment. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
