Just noticed, renewed email notifications from Twitter. Twitter like many other social service sends you notifications via email for activities on your account. I personally use email notifications to stay updated when somebody starts following me.

Below is recent email notification from Twitter&#8230;

And below is snapshot of old email notification from Twitter&#8230;

You can clearly notice the difference between the above two.

New email notification show&#8217;s display pic of Twitter user which makes it easier to identify who started following you without visiting their profile. It also list stats about her account like number of twitter users following her, number of updates she had posted over time and number of twitter user she is following.

Looks like Twitter is trying hard to improve entire service. Orkut did [similar thing][1] when they launched major improvements to their network last year.
