German authorities have asked Google to improve its privacy protection measures before it can allow pictures of German city streets on its Street View service.

Google says that it would be blurring faces and vehicle license plates when displaying the images online and that it would promptly respond to removal requests.

German officials, however, feel that Google privacy policy is flawed and it could be easily violated since Google employees will have access to the “un-blurred” pictures.

> **Marit Hansen, the state&#8217;s deputy officer in charge of privacy protection said:**
> 
> “We find the project extremely alarming… It gathers personal data and puts it on the Internet. That will not do.”
> 
> **Reinhold Harwart, the leader of the CDU on the town council said:**
> 
> “We are not going to let this happen. You can see everything in those photos! That is opening house and home to criminals!”

Street View provides 360-degree panoramic images of urban areas that the user can manipulate, as part of Google’s Internet mapping products.

Google Street View was launched in 2007 and since then it has reached out to more than 100 cities worldwide. At the same time it has faced complaints related to privacy from many people and institutions that have been photographed.

Well, well… where do you think the Google street view controversy is headed for next?
