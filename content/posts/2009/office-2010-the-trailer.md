The guys at Redmond have released a mind-blowing, special-effects filled video trailer of their newest Office offering, the Office 2010. The Microsoft officials have already confirmed that Office 2010 will be released by the first quarter of 2010.



What is great to see is that Microsoft is getting many things right this time with the success of Bing, then the approval it got from the public on its next OS, Windows se7en and now this video.

Of course, the main thing that remains to be seen is the actual product!
