Though the design was as usual, the new favicon looks more attractive as it has been made more glossy!

  Though I noticed it few weeks ago, it seems guys at Orkut did not find it worth mentioning on their <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/', 'official blog']);" >official blog</a> about such a good change.

  If you are not aware, earlier this year, favicon of other Google products <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/again-google-revamped-its-favicon/">were been revamped</a> and now Orkut too, underwent a favicon change. Is Google on its way to rebrand all its product? What’s you take about this new favicon?
