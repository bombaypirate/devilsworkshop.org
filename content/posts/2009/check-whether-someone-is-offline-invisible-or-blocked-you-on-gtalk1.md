Every day, the number of Gtalk users multiply. With Gtalk getting popular day by day, there is a need for some tricks and tweaks to get the most out of the service you are making use of, and to continue being called a ‚Äògeek‚Äô in your friends circle. üòâ

  In this article, I am going to write about two unique stuffs about Gtalk that you may not be aware about.
</p>

  1. <div>
      <strong>Finding out friends who are online, but in invisible mode: <br /></strong>As I remember, Google launched a feature of chatting in invisible mode a year ago. Invisible feature can be used from latest versions of almost all browsers or from <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/labsedition/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/talk/labsedition/', 'Gtalk labs']);" target="_blank">Gtalk labs</a>. Couple of months ago Rahul posted an article on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/bug-in-google-talks-gmail-chat-invisible-status-feature-hack/" target="_blank">figuring out who is online in invisible mode</a>. The other trick I am going to write today is really too simple and silly and will help you only if you have a GPRS activated mobile. To use this trick, <strong>simply download and install </strong><a href="http://www.gotalkmobile.com/gotalkmobile_download.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gotalkmobile.com/gotalkmobile_download.html', 'gotalkmobile']);" target="_blank"><strong>gotalkmobile</strong></a><strong> into your GPRS activated mobile, login with your Gtalk ID & pass and it will show up all the person online</strong>, doesn‚Äôt matter whether they are visible or invisible. üòâ
    </div>

  2. <div>
      <strong>Finding out whether someone has blocked you or is offline</strong>: <br />Many a times anxiety engulfs our mind when we don‚Äôt find some of our friends (specially girl friends üòâ ) online for a long period of time. If it is so, the friend might be remaining invisible or offline all the times or he/she must have blocked you. In the above point, we have mentioned about two cool tricks to find whether a friend is really offline or is avoiding you remaining invisible. But what if they would have blocked you? You‚Äôll presume that they are offline but in realty they may not be. In this case, Rakshit will help you on ‚Äú<a href="http://www.rakshitk.com/blog/2008/01/26/how-to-check-if-someone-has-blocked-you-on-google-talk/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rakshitk.com/blog/2008/01/26/how-to-check-if-someone-has-blocked-you-on-google-talk/', 'how to check whether someone has blocked you on gtalk']);" target="_blank">how to check whether someone has blocked you on gtalk</a>‚Äù.
