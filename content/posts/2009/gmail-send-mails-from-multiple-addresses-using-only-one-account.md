I have two Gmail accounts, one is my personal email and second is of my blog. Last week, I found out how to integrate both the email addresses so that I could change the &#8220;From&#8221; field and send an email from any account. It does not matter from which account you are logged in.<!--more-->

**Here is what you have to do to integrate your Gmail accounts **

  1. LogIn and go to Settings, click on the Accounts Tab
  2. Under &#8220;send mail as:&#8221; click **Add another email address you own**

  3. A window pops up asking you to enter the email address which you wish to integrate
  4. Gmail sends a verification email to the address specified, Sign In to your other gmail account and confirm the link or paste the verification code.
  5. That&#8217;s it! Your done.
