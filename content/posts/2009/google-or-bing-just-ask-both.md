<img class="alignright wp-image-51137" style="border: 0pt none;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/07/image17.png" border="0" alt="image" width="216" height="212" align="right" /> Should I try Microsoft’s beautiful search engine &#8211; Bing? Or should I stick to my all time favorite &#8211; Google? Torn between the two? In case you are, not to worry, now you have the option to ask them both together!

<a href="http://www.askboth.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.askboth.com/', 'Askboth.com']);" >Askboth.com</a> is a new web 2.0 twin search engine for you, coupled with Google as well as Bing, keeping all that confusion at bay. This means, you can now easily search for information on both the search engines at the same time.

Askboth.com has the regular features of Content Search on the Web as well as Image Search. This can also work as a SEO tool for you to compare the results on both the sites. You could even add it to your browser as your default search engine.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;margin-left: 12px;margin-right: 12px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/07/clip-image0051.jpg" border="0" alt="clip_image005" hspace="12" width="497" height="243" />
</p>

So, all those who laid eyes on Bing and just couldn’t get enough, but also couldn’t let go of old pal Google, this seems like an appealing option.

Try it out to see if it tickles your fancy.
