The file that I received was that of an .iso format. The next step is to burn it to a CD. Now this is where a lot of people get confused. They usually burn the ISO as a file rather than that of a CD image. Not getting it? Just read on.

## First of all what&#8217;s an .iso file?

Well its basically an image of the CD as it is. Rather that burning it as a file, you&#8217;ve got to burn it as an image into the CD.

Now here&#8217;s where the second trouble arises. If you were to search for something like &#8216;how to burn an ISO file&#8217;, you would probably get the answer of using Nero. Although it is a good software, it costs some dough (I&#8217;m an open source guy! ;D) and of late it&#8217;s got a lot of bloat accompanying it.

So what&#8217;s the free alternative then? Well a little searching around could lead to a lot of alternatives, still I prefer <a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm', 'ISO Recorder']);" >ISO Recorder</a> (currently v2) Alex Feinman. You can download this software from <a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm', 'here']);" >here</a>. It is currently available for Windows XP and above (even Seven.) It can be used to burn ISO&#8217;s to a CD or DVD.

Once downloaded, the installation is a breeze. Now just right click on the file that you want to burn as an image to the CD, and select &#8216;Copy Image To CD.&#8217; That&#8217;s it, ISO Recorder would fire up immediately. Choose the drive you want to use for the burning process. You can also configure certain options like &#8216;Recording speed&#8217; and &#8216;Eject afterwards.&#8217;

Such a breeze. So what&#8217;s your feedback? BTW, you can get links to download the Ubuntu 9.10 ISO from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors', 'here']);" >here</a>. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
