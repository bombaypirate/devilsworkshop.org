## Free Domains:

Like co.cc, CO.TV also provides free domain for a year. After that, what happens to the domain is unclear, but according to their site, &#8216;*At the first registration process you are able to use your domain name for one year. You may renew your domain from your management panel.* &#8216; Hmm, needs more clarifications.

**Features:**

  * Free domain
  * Site Builder
  * Manage your DNS
  * Free MX service
  * Zone Records
  * URL Forwarding

## Premium Domains:

CO.TV provides premium domains at a cost of $4.99/domain. But what exactly is a premium domain? Well I found this on their site:** **

> In the domain market &#8220;Premium&#8221; is used as a definition for the names which has some characteristic specialties and can be used as a brand name. Generally names which has more than one meaning or generic, short and easy to remember are included in this category. The names which are mostly searched in search engines and has high rates as key words also classified as Premium domain name.

At the time of posting this article download.co.tv was available as a premium domain for $92.97

    With a free account you can register up to 3 domains. Once you exceed that limit you will need to pay $4.99 for each domain.  Or you can pay $199 for premium CO.TV which includes unlimited domains.
