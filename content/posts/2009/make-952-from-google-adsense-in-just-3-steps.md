If you don&#8217;t believe me just check out the screen shot below. ðŸ˜›<figure id="attachment_3620" style="width: 611px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  Shocked? Obviously you must have been. I started my blogging career an year ago and I got my first AdSense check only 3 months back.Â  Before that, I used to check my balance everyday and what I got was a dollar or two and sometimes only a few cents. But this new trick will help you make your account balance reach a huge amount you can ever imagine.

  Wait, But this time Google will not be sending any checks for these balance. Yeah, the screenshot shown above was taken from a fake AdSense generator. You can generate a balance page with any amount you want. Use this trick to show your friends how much you &#8220;earned&#8221; with Google AdSense this month.

  Oh, You still want the three steps. Okay, here they are
</p>

  1. Login to this <a href="http://googleadsensegenerator.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleadsensegenerator.com/', 'site']);" title="Oops, This isn't real"  target="_blank">site</a>
  2. Enter the amount you want
  3. Click on make money

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For those who came to this post on reading the title. Sorry to disappoint you guys. I wished there was some real way of making more $$ from AdSense. But as you know, money doesn&#8217;t come the easy way. So, work hard on your sites and money will start flowing through automatically.
