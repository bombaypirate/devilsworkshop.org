excerpt: Because of the latest events in Iran, search giant Google has added Persian language to Google Translate. In my previous post, I had mentioned how social networking site Facebook too launched its Persian version. These efforts should hopefully improve access to information and communication for Persian speakers across the globe.

In my [previous post][1], I had mentioned how social networking site Facebook too launched its Persian version. These efforts should hopefully improve access to information and communication for Persian speakers across the globe.

Now people can translate any text, whether it’s a news story, a website, a blog, an email, a tweet or a Facebook message, from Persian into English and from English into Persian. This will increase access to information for all and allow Persian speakers to communicate directly to the world, and vice versa.

## How does it work?

1. Go to <a href="http://translate.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://translate.google.com', 'http://translate.google.com']);" >http://translate.google.com</a>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/clip-image0049.jpg" border="0" alt="clip_image004" hspace="12" width="556" height="208" />
</p>

2. Enter the search phrase in the box provided

3. Select the language you want the content to be translated “from” and “to”

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/clip-image00272.jpg" border="0" alt="clip_image002[7]" hspace="12" width="592" height="190" />
</p>

4. Hit “Translate”

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/06/image46.png" border="0" alt="image" width="572" height="126" />
</p>

Simple!

Google believes in organizing the world&#8217;s information and making it universally accessible and useful. Till date, translations from Google are already available in 41 other languages, apart from Persian.

### Languages available for translation other than Persian

  3. Bulgarian
  4. Catalan
  5. Chinese
  6. Croatian

Although Google admits that Farsi translation is not as polished and accurate as Spanish to English translations yet, but they are working on improving it soon. This is perhaps because they don&#8217;t have much data from which they can build their systems, hence Google is welcoming help from Persian speakers.
