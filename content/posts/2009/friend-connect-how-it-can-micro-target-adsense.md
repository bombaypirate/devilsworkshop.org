</h3>

**Friend Connect** will allow visitors on a website to share information through member gadgets and can have relevant ads from Google Adsense using information taken with the various interactive web gadgets. For example if you put up **Nokia** as your favorite mobile maker while on a mobile review website, **Friend Connect** will get you relevant Nokia ads with **<a href="https://www.google.com/adsense" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense', 'Google Adsense']);" >Google Adsense</a>**.

This can be quite handy as it will actually increase the chances of someone clicking on the ads being displayed on the website. This may not be very handy for big websites as the assumption with **Friend Connect** is that all your visitors might have a Google account especially for certain features but it is very handy for bloggers as it is mainly an interactive tool to help make the content on your website sensitive to what visitors are interested in.
