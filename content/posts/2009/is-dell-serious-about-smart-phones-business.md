<img class="wp-image-52623" style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;margin: 5px 0px 0px 10px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" height="79" alt="DellLogo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/02/delllogo.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /> Recently the Wall Street Journal featured that Dell is moving away its concentration in its main stream business of computers and planning to come out with a manufacturing unit for smart phones under its own banner ‘Dell’. According to reports, the move is being considered keeping in mind the struggles Dell has to face in these tuff times of recession. 

If we believe to rumors about the Dell smart phone then it is said that, these phones will be based on Google’s Android and Windows OS. Right now, Android has been used only in a T- Mobile based phone. It has also been reported in the Wall Street Journal that among the two phones currently being developed by Dell, one will be a slider and the other one would be a touch screen handheld. So, its just matter of time that will disclose the reality whether Dell is really moving to smart phones business or not!
