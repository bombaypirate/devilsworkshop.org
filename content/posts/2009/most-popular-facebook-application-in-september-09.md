Well what actually makes Facebook world&#8217;s best social networking website is not just it&#8217;s privacy features but also some of the most interesting applications in it. Like the application we are gonna talk about in this post but it&#8217;s not a single application, rather it&#8217;s a couple of applications.

The applications which were most popular in the month of september are &#8220;Friend of the Day&#8221; and &#8220;Enemy of the Day&#8221;. Although &#8220;Fans Check&#8221; and &#8220;Tag your Friends&#8221; like applications were used a lot but people found that uninteresting.

In &#8220;Friend of the Day&#8221; application, the application selects random six friends from your profile and you can choose anyone from them and publish it on your walls well as on your friend&#8217;s homepage. Everything is same in another application &#8220;Enemy of the Day&#8221; except the name. You can select your &#8220;Enemy of the Day&#8221; from randomly selected people from your profile.

Just check out these wapplications and tell us what you think about them. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
