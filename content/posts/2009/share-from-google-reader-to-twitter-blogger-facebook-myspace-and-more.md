I use Google Reader to follow blogs on a daily basis. Sometimes we are so preoccupied with the basic functionalities of something we use everyday that you forget, there is something called &#8216;**Settings**&#8216; which can make life a lot simpler.

With <a href="http://google.com/reader" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com/reader', 'Google Reader']);" >Google Reader</a> it is quite easy to share an article using my Gmail account. But I use Facebook and Twitter to share links of online articles that I read. These are not necessarily just what I write but also anything that I come across which I find interesting. Recently I came across a way to do this using Google Reader directly.

### Google Reader Settings

  * While using Google Reader click on &#8216;**Settings**&#8216;. This will open up a host of tabs. Click on the &#8216;**Send To**&#8216; tab.
  * You can see that the **&#8216;Send To&#8217;** settings allow you to select a number of ways to share the post online. As you can see in the image below I decided to share it using **Twitter** and **Facebook**.

  * Once I selected the two websites or services I wanted, I had to start using **Google Reader** to read articles and look up something that I found interesting enough to share on **Twitter** and **Facebook**.
  * While reading a post on Google Reader, there is now a new option available with every post that is &#8216;**Send To**&#8216;
  * I just needed to click on it and select which website or service I wanted to send the link to.
