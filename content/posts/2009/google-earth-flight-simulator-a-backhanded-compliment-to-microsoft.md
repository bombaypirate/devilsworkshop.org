A lot of us who use **Google Earth** do not know about **Flight Simulator** mode in Google Earth. I have been using Google Earth for over 3 years now and was still unaware of the Flight Simulator tool until a few days ago. With Flight Simulator in Google Earth allowing me to take off from Kathmandu Airport into the mountains, it brought back memories of an addictive video game I had played as a teen almost 10 years ago.

The similarities with **<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/flightsimulatorx/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/games/flightsimulatorx/', 'Flight Simulator']);" >Flight Simulator</a> **by** Microsoft** were too many to not think of this mode as a backhanded compliment by Google Earth developers to Microsoft.

### Google Earth: Flight Simulator

  * To start Flight Simulator mode start **Google Earth **andÂ click on the globe once and press Ctrl + Alt + A. This starts the flight simulator mode and the following screen appears.

  * It is not very complex except the <a href="http://earth.google.com/intl/en/userguide/v5/flightsim/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://earth.google.com/intl/en/userguide/v5/flightsim/index.html', 'controls']);" >controls</a> seem to be a little too sensitive. The HUD screen resembles being inside aÂ airplaneÂ cockpit.
  * The idea is pretty amazing, especially for kids being introduced to Google Earth. Imagine flying around in a airplane over your ownÂ neighborhoodÂ on your desktop. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * The whole feel of it, with selecting Airports from around the world and different plane models is very similar to very early versions of Flight Simulator by Microsoft.
  * Playing around with it IÂ immediatelyÂ realized that this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)', 'Easter Egg']);" >Easter Egg</a> within Google Earth was like a homage being paid to Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator video game.

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/flightsimulatorx/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/games/flightsimulatorx/', 'Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator X']);" >Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator X</a> was less of a game and more of a virtualÂ environmentÂ for flying enthusiasts with a virtualÂ environment to simulate the whole world. Google Earth is probably paying homage to a very old and loved video game.

**Interesting Factoid: **Flight Simulator software from Microsoft is 2 years older than its Windows Licence. ðŸ˜‰
