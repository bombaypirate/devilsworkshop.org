I am going to post a trick, which many of you may be interested to know that how to change background of a Folder in Windows XP. After much Googling on this topic I&#8217;ve found two ways one is related to coding, so it is recommended to advanced users and the other way is by using a simple software which anyone can easily use.<img class="alignnone" src="http://img3.orkut.com/img/smiley/i_wink.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" />

I am posting the most convenient way over here. For this you need to get a software named <a href="http://www.sodabush.com/windowpaper/downloads.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sodabush.com/windowpaper/downloads.php', 'SodaBush Windowpaper XP']);" >SodaBush Windowpaper XP</a>. It is a freeware and you can get from its <a href="http://www.sodabush.com/windowpaper/downloads.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sodabush.com/windowpaper/downloads.php', 'official website']);" >official website</a>. It requires [.NET Framework][1] 2. After getting this Software you can select the folder and change its background whatever you would like to have.<figure id="attachment_3084" style="width: 490px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<a rel="attachment wp-att-3084" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/change-folders-background-in-windows-xp/gui/"><img class="size-full wp-image-3084" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2008/12/gui.jpg" alt="Preview" width="490" height="270" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Preview</figcaption></figure> 

You can now be able to change from your old boring white background to your own custom Background. The background image can be bmp , gif or jpg.

I&#8217;ve posted a short video which explains how the changes are done<a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=0QOf8WlHPs0" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=0QOf8WlHPs0', '']);" title="How to change Folder Background in Windows XP"  target="_blank"></a>. Enjoy!!<img class="alignnone" src="http://img3.orkut.com/img/smiley/i_confuse.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" />
