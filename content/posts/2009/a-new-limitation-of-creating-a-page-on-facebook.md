Just few hours back, we wrote about the new <a href="http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/10/26/how-to-setup-a-username-for-your-facebook-pages/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebooknol.com/2009/10/26/how-to-setup-a-username-for-your-facebook-pages/', 'Facebook usernames for Pages']);" >Facebook usernames for Pages</a>. If you read that post, you must have noticed one thing that the Facebook was not allowing us to use the username &#8220;FacebooKnol&#8221;. After searching for sometime, I finally got the reason for it.

Nowadays Facebook is quite serious about the copyright cases specially for it&#8217;s pages. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you are using the name of a celeb in your profile name or you are using a name of an organisation in your profile, Facebook either won&#8217;t allow you to do so or it will disable your profile/page later as it&#8217;s against their Terms of Use.(<a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/terms.php', 'Facebook terms']);" >Facebook terms</a>)

For an instance, I was creating a page &#8220;Sharing random stuff on Facebook and Twitter&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t get a permission from Facebook to create this page, neither I was able to create a page &#8220;Sharing random stuff on Facebook&#8221;. However I easily created a page called &#8220;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sharing-Random-stuff-on-Twitter/178952567104?v=wall" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sharing-Random-stuff-on-Twitter/178952567104?v=wall', 'Share random stuff on Twitter']);" >Share random stuff on Twitter</a>&#8221; ðŸ˜‰

**It clearly means** that from now, you won&#8217;t be able to use the keyword &#8220;Facebook&#8221; in a page. i.e neither in the username not anywhere in the name of that particular page.
