**VMware** is working on Mobile Phone (*Particularly Smart Phone*) Virtualization, which would be commercially available in near future.

As hardware of mobile phones is closing in on a Netbook, their software development is also progressing at the same pace.

In an interview to ***Computer World***, Srinivas Krishnamurti, **VMware’s** head of mobile phone virtualisation said the company’s vision for virtualisation on smartphones went beyond the basic dual-boot prototypes.

They are also working on usage of multiple operating systems at the same time.

> “We don’t think dual booting will be good enough &#8211; we’ll allow you to run both profiles at the same time and be able to switch between them by clicking a button,” he said. “You’ll be able to get and make calls in either profile – work or home – as they will both be live at any given point in time.”

Also **VMware** has successfully demonstrated **Android** and **Windows Mobile** on a last generation smartphone with 128MB. (Nokia N800)

Pros: With implementation of this technology users can use Apps of all installed platforms. Thus Increasing Apps Base available to users. One can get advantages of all platforms, that to on cost of one Hardware.

Cons: Customer has to pay for license of **Multiple Platforms** along with VMware software.

Combination of this technology with dual sim devices would work well. It would be savior for people who need multiple smartphones. With just one hardware they can get benefits of two smartphones.

So what’s your take???

Though it sounds pretty cool, do you think it would be really helpful???
