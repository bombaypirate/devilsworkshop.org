You will find maximum sites who rate for the best [video game][1] systems, but this site is different and unique. It shows the second site of the coin. Here are some of the worst video game systems till now.

  1. **RCA Studio II**:- The RCA Studio II was second [game console][2] in history to use interchangeable ROM cartridges. Unfortunately for RCA, the first and third game consoles in this category&#8211;the Fair child Channel F and the Atari VCS&#8211;worked much better.
  2. **Tiger Telematics Gizmondo**:- If there were ever a complete train wreck of a game console, Gizmondo would be it. But its tarnished name in the gaming world has as much to do with the audacious, profligate, and illegal behavior of Tiger Telematics&#8217; executives as anything else. Well, that and a terrible game library.
  3. **Tandy/Memorex VIS**:- During the rush-to-[multimedia][3]enthusiasm of the early 1990s&#8211;prompted in part by the Philips CD-i platform&#8211;other manufacturers found the pitter-patter of little lemming feet irresistible. Tandy was among the companies that joined the multimedia procession, with its Video Information System (VIS)&#8211;essentially a lackluster knockoff of the already horrendous CD-i platform.
  4. **Philips CD-i**:- The Philips CD-i was in interesting idea: a CD-ROM-based consumer multimedia gaming/edutainment machine that would occupy a spot next to the VCR in the living room. Positioning the CD-i almost as a commodity device, Philips created new CD standards for its content and licensed the platform to other manufacturers.
  5. **RDI Halcyon**:- Released in limited quantities and priced at a credit-line-denuding $2500 (that&#8217;s the equivalent of $4954 in 2009 dollars), the RDI Video Systems Halcyon was destined for obscurity before it left the gate. Its entire purpose was to enable users to play branching laser disc video games similar to the 1983 arcade hit Dragon&#8217;s Lair (another RDI product) at home.
  6. **Gakken TV Boy**:- In 1983, Japan experienced a boomlet in home-grown game consoles, among which was this oddity, the Gakken TV Boy. Not too long after the TV Boy&#8217;s brief flowering, the Nintendo Famicom (the Japanese NES, also released in 1983) became a stunning success and swept most of its competitors out of the marketplace.
  7. **Mattel Hyper scan**:- The Hyper scan was a marketer&#8217;s dream&#8211;a product that incorporated video games and the game card collecting craze. For every Hyper scan game available on CD, Mattel also sold booster packs of paper trading cards, each card embedded with an RFID chip.
  8. **Nokia N-Gage**:- As the 21st century dawned, a new class of multiuse handhold devices entered the marketplace, including this console from Nokia. The N-Gage combined a cell phone and a handheld video game console into a single device that performed neither function very well. Nokia subsequently redesigned the N-Gage hardware to correct many of the original model&#8217;s mistakes.
  9. **Tiger Game.com**:- By the late 1990s, Tiger was well established as a maker of handhold electronic games. Every toy store had a cheap Tiger LCD handhold in stock, and it stood to reason that Tiger would eventually come out with a product to challenge Nintendo Game Boy preeminence in the handhold gaming universe.
 10. **Apple Pippin**:- Apple Computer designed Pippin as a &#8220;multimedia appliance&#8221; and licensed it to other companies for manufacture (Only Bandai and Katz Media signed on). Unfortunately, Apple&#8217;s new platform had a bit of an identity crisis: it was a game console, a Web-browsing network computer, and a multimedia player&#8211;but it did all of those tasks poorly. Our colleagues at Mac world actually named it one of the six worst Apple products ever (it came in at number three).

These details are collected from a large source.
