The website is currently in beta testing version and its member features are disabled. However, you can still search for any song, play it and even make endless playlists of your own choice. Once its member features are enabled, you will be able to save your playlists and access them online from anywhere.

It has a simple, user-friendly layout that allows you to listen to over 16 million songs online without any legal issues. They pay for the licenses in proportion to the number of plays they get.

So, if you’re yearning to listen to a particular song, I&#8217;d say, this is just the place to search it! Enjoy! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
