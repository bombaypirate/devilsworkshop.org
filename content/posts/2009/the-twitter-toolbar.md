But being signed- in continuously on a website like Twitter sometimes is a bit of a bother and hence I thought a nice tool-bar to send tweets across seems like a good idea.

I was looking up the internet to see if I could find a <a href="http://www.thetwittertoolbar.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thetwittertoolbar.com/', 'twitter toolbar ']);" >twitter toolbar </a>and was lucky to have found one. Its is quite easy and was just what I really needed.

**Tweet Now**: Tweet Now allowed me to type in my user-name and password and then the message. Clicked on &#8216;Send Tweet&#8217; and it was posted on my twitter page. The part which might disappoint is that it does not store the user-name and password and you have to type that in every time you need to send a tweet. I personally liked that feature as I tend to forget signing out of tool-bars.

**Twoak**: The problems with long URLs is when you want to use &#8216;Tweet Now&#8217; on the tool-bar it unlike twitter it does not shorten or cloak the link. In this case you can always use &#8216;Twoak&#8217; and copy the shortened link into &#8216;Tweet Now&#8217;. Twitter allows only 140 characters per tweet hence this is quite useful.

**Twitter Tools:** TwitterTools provided me with links to up to 30 odd twitter tools in a neatly arrange drop-down menu. These tools are web based and the links take you directly to the one you selected on the browser.

**Twitter Research:** Just like &#8216;Twitter Tools&#8217; was a assortment of tools Twitter Research shows up in a drop down menu a number useful websites do some research on Twitter. One of my favourites amongst them are &#8216;Twitter Forum&#8217; and &#8216;Twit Polls&#8217;.

Twitter Toolbar is available for Firefox and Internet Explorer.
