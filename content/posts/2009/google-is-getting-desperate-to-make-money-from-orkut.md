  I remember well, about a year ago, Google’s social networking site &#8211; <a href="http://www.orkut.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com', 'Orkut']);" >Orkut</a> started displaying Google adsense ads on Orkut users’ homepage below the ‘Community’ section. Infact, we posted about it on March 2008 <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/orkut-started-showing-google-adsense-ads-on-user-homepages/">here</a>. But its really amazing to see Google getting desperate about generating more revenue from Orkut users. Guess what? This evening when I logged into Orkut, I was surprised to see the placement of Google ads between ‘Friends’ and ‘Community’ section.

  For your ready reference, I have uploaded a screenshot herewith wherein you can clearly notice how Google ads are interfering between ‘Friends’ and ‘Community’ section. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  This time atleast, with change of placements of Google ads, its really very annoying as it interrupts while navigating between friends and community section.

  Initiative to keep Orkut going?
</h3>

<p align="justify">
  Though I was disappointed by these changes, immediately after seeing it, I started thinking whether this is an initiative by Google to keep Orkut alive? Actually few days ago, when Google shut down some of its services, their were rumors floating around the internet that <a href="http://www.insideorkut.com/2009/01/will-google-shut-down-orkut.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.insideorkut.com/2009/01/will-google-shut-down-orkut.html', 'Orkut too may get closed']);" >Orkut too may get closed</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  May be this move by Google is to keep Orkut survive in these tough time, but I personally feel this change very annoying. What do you think?
