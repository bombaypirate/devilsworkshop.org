What Chrome Frame does instead of asking people to view websites with another browser, is that it prompts for Chrome Frame as an add-on and the Chrome browser works inside the Internet Explorer seamlessly.

Microsoft&#8217;s response has been pretty much on expected lines, except that they could have simply ignored this development and carried on with improvements with their browser.

### Microsoft&#8217;sÂ ArgumentsÂ against Chrome Frame

  1. Internet Explorer 8 is much safer than most browsers in the market and if Chrome Frame runs inside Internet Explorer 8, some vital security features of the IE8 browser may be compromised.
  2. With Chrome Frame running inside Internet Explorer, hackers using script for Chrome browser can hack into Internet Explorer. This clearly implies that Internet Explorer 8 is safer than Chrome. ðŸ˜‰

What I find interesting is Microsoft keeps commenting on how Internet Explorer 8 performs against other browsers but a big number of IE users are using IE7 or even IE6.

Chrome Frame is definitely a great help for IE6 or IE7 users. Also Microsoft is still not actively telling people to move to IE8 by forcing a upgrade on a large scale.

I think its a typical reaction by a dominant market leader who gets nervous about the competition. Bring up the security issue and say your product is safer instead of making it better. Microsoft needs to wake up and dramatically improve Internet Explorer otherwise it will see its market dominanceÂ spiralingÂ downwards slowly but surely.
