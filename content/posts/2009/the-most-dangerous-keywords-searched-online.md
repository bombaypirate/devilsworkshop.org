<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9644" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/05/image27.jpg" alt="image1" width="97" height="99" />McAfee recently released a report on <a href="http://newsroom.mcafee.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=3526" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://newsroom.mcafee.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=3526', 'The Web’s Most Dangerous Search Terms']);" >The Web’s Most Dangerous Search Terms</a>**.** The report describes how cybercriminals are making the most of the popular search terms online, and entice searchers to download files carrying malicious software, as a result, exposing their personal and financial data.

The reports also indicate that with the economic slowdown, malicious search results have risen, as the number of hits on free products, work from home options, etc. have increased.

Topping the list of some of the most high-risk searches on the Web today is “Screensavers” with a maximum risk of 59.1%. “Lyrics” and anything that includes “free” has the highest risk percentage of exposing the users to fraudulent websites and malicious software.

## Statistics

McAfee searched for more than 2,600 popular keywords and more than 413,000 unique URLs (web addresses). Here are some highlights of the report:

  * The categories with the worst maximum risk profile were **lyrics keywords (26.3%) **and phrases that include the word **“free” (21.3%)**. If a consumer landed at the riskiest search page for a typical lyrics search, one of four results would be risky.
  * The categories with the **safest risk profile were health-related search terms **and searches concerning the recent economic crisis.
  * The riskiest set of keyword variations was **“screensavers” with a maximum risk of 59.1% **and an average risk of 34.4%.
  * Surprisingly, searches using the keyword “Viagra,” a popular keyword that is a frequent “visitor” in our spam filters, yielded the fewest risky sites.
  * Keywords popular in non-US countries were significantly riskier than those popular in the United States. 14 countries had keyword lists that exposed users to a higher maximum risk than average, including the Czech Republic (14.2%) and Brazil (12.1%). And 12 countries were overall riskier than the average, including Mexico (1.9%) and India (1.8%).

## Work from home scams

The chance to make good money while you “work from home” lures many people. And with the economic slowdown, and with many people losing their jobs, people end up giving these scams a try, which is a huge gamble. Work from home searches can be as much as four times more risky than the average for all popular terms. And on average, these searches are 50% more risky than other popular terms.

So what have you been searching for online lately? Unfortunately, today, mere reliance on intuition or knowledge of past risks is not enough to stay safe on the web. Even technically sophisticated users are at risk. It is very important to have security suite installed on your PC and use safe search tools. Let’s be extra careful!
