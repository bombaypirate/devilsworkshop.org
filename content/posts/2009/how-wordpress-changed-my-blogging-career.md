It was my <a href="http://symposiumz.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://symposiumz.net', 'symposiumz']);" >symposiumz</a> blog that I used for writing the post.

If anyone had asked me what was the best decision that you made in your blogging career, then I would definitely say choosing &#8220;<a href="http://www.wordpress.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wordpress.org', 'WordPress']);" >WordPress</a>&#8220;!

## From Blogger to WordPress: Comparing the Stats

### **Visitors:**

Earlier, when my site was in Blogger, it used to have around 200 visitors per day(max). The page hits were so low that sometimes it would make me think that &#8220;Blogging is not for me&#8221;. But now, after shifting to WordPress, the graph is just increasing. The minimum visitor count per day I got till now was only 1.5k or so.

### **PageÂ  views:**

The same story is with the number of page views. If there are more visitors, then automatically your page views would increase. I remember asking Rahul during the migration process &#8220;What do you feel about my site? It gets around 15k page views per month.&#8221; He replied back saying, it is quite decent (I knew it was not) and it should increase constantly, which is a healthy factor for any site. But now, I get 15k page views, in 2 days.

### **Search engine visitors:**

The number of visitors coming from search engines (mainly Google) were only 20-50 when I was in Blogger. But, now I get more than 1k queries per day. For some of the keywords, my site shows on the first page in Google after this migration.

### **<a href="http://www.alexa.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alexa.com', 'Alexa']);" >Alexa</a> ranking:**

Symposiumz ranking was around 7 lakh when it was in Blogger. Now, it is about to touch 1lakh soon. But the Google page rank doesn&#8217;t seem to have changed much. May be it takes some time.

### **RSS readers:**

If I remember correctly, my RSS feed count was close to 200 in Blogger. But now, it is about to cross 3k. I think, that would be a nice figure for any site.

### **Site reach:**

Earlier, my site got visitors only from Chennai. Now, it has slowly expanded and I can see the patches spreading all over India in my analytics account.

### **<a href="http://www.adsense.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adsense.com', 'Adsense']);" >Adsense</a> revenue:**

It took nearly 9 months to get my first cheque from Adsense. But now, I get a check every month. You could calculate the minimum amount I could earn from that. ðŸ˜‰

All these things happened within a minimum span of 3 months. It is off season for my site and the visitor count has reduced to some amount. But WordPress bought a big change in my stats in the past few months. Moreover, WordPress is so customizable that you will feel the difference and you wouldnt regret migrating. If you are new to blogging, I would **strongly** recommend you to start your blogging career with WordPress.

And again, thanks Rahul for all your help.
