&#8216;Make the world groove to your music&#8217; that&#8217;s what Orkut says in introduction to it&#8217;s recently launched theme or skin &#8216;I, Music Jockey&#8217;. Including this recently launched and the default &#8216;Orkut Blue&#8217; theme, Orkut has a total of 23 themes (for Orkut India) mostly of which are based either on seasons or on different Indian festivals like Diwali and Independence Day.

### SCREEN SHOT:

<img class="aligncenter size-medium  wp-image-53016" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/09/images-Copy-450x337.jpg" alt="images - Copy" width="450" height="337" />

&#8216;I, Music Jockey&#8217; theme is basically an advertisement of the phone 5800 by Nokia, however the phone itself is not in the theme. Actually the tag-line of this theme &#8216;I am my own music jockey&#8217; matches with that of Nokia 5800 and a logo of Nokia is also given in the header of the theme which clearly says that this theme is sponsored by Nokia.

### USING THEME/SKIN:
