Most times when we use search we do not need to use the **Advanced Search** options on any search engine. This is especially true for people looking to buy something online. But very often we end up using advanced search options for getting exact information which sometimes can be called niche.

<a href="http://searchzooka.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://searchzooka.com', 'Searchzooka']);" >Searchzooka</a> is one such website which allows you to carry out advanced search using various **search engines** on the internet which includes **Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask, Digg, Technorati and Del.icio.us<span style="font-weight: normal">. What&#8217;s more is that you can save these results like a list.</span>**

  * As you can see in the image above, I searched for Devils Workshop. It gave me relevant search details with **Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask, Digg, Technorati and Del.icio.us. **There is no need to register or sign up to save the search. It gets automatically saved with the help of cookies.
  * In case you clear the cookies or change your computer you can recover the advances search but using a recovery key.
  * I could also search by relevance or by date.
  * The search criteria can really be tweaked a lot. I can specify particular date line to search within. I could also specify the search within a particular top level domain like **.net**, **.org** and **.com.**
  * There is also an option to search for files with the search engines. If a particular engine does not support the particular feature it gives results which are default.
  * I could also keep my search query be looked up **anywhere** on the net or even in specific **page titles** and **URLs**.

I think this website is a great tool to carry out research of a subject using various search engines. Often when we search we do not find something we want and we end up using another search engine. The need for this is removed with <a href="http://searchzooka.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://searchzooka.com', 'searchzooka']);" >searchzooka</a> doing this in one go and hence saving a lot of time. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
