For eg. in this post the ad that is displayed below the post title is my ad. Any revenue generated by clicks on the above ad, is paid to my adsense account. But the thing is that with plugins like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advertising-manager/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advertising-manager/', 'Advertising Manager']);" target="_blank">Advertising Manager</a>, this method is easy to implement in WordPress. On blogger its a little more extra code. See how you can implement it in Google&#8217;s BlogSpot.

**Follow these steps to implement this hack in blogger:**

  1. Search for the place that you are going to insert your ad in. For this tutorial I am taking the space after the post title.
  2. Find **<data:post.body/>**
  3. Insert the following code:  
    > <b:if cond=&#8217;data:post.author== &#8220;Ricky&#8221;&#8216;>  
    > <!&#8211; Ricky&#8217;s Ad code here&#8211;>  
    > </b:if>
    > 
    > <b:if cond=&#8217;data:post.author== &#8220;Joe&#8221;&#8216;>  
    > <!&#8211; Joe&#8217;s Ad code here&#8211;>  
    > </b:if>

  4. Done!

The code is pretty self-explanatory. Suppose the authors name is Joel, replace Ricky in the first line of the code. Also don&#8217;t forget to insert the ad code in place of <!&#8211; Ricky&#8217;s Ad code here&#8211;> or the place. If you have more authors, just repeat the three lines again and again.

### Whats the Advantage of such a thing?

To increase the traffic for a blog the main thing that is required is fresh content that is regularly updated. When you offer a revenue sharing program like this, people get interested quickly, because there is an incentive in it for them.

They will post regularly for you, because the more they post, the more they can earn. And due to the fresh content you get more traffic day by day. Its a win-win situation for everyone at last!
