  Today, I was at my dad&#8217;s office and interestingly the Wi-Fi locator on his notebook flashed a new network &#8211; &#8216;Hari Om&#8217; it showed the holly network as unsecured! My curiosity got the better of me and I instantly double clicked and Wolla! It was connected with a signal strength of 80%.

  Although, I wasn&#8217;t hopping of any miracles but Firefox opened the default Google homepage and before I knew it internet was working on my laptop. I figured,&#8221;Essentially, I&#8217;d hacked into his Wi-Fi. Cool huh?&#8221;  <em>His net connection was at my mercy. I could do anything, send emails to anybody and walk off without being traced. </em>

<p align="justify">
  The point is, did I <strong>HACK</strong> his Wi-Fi or did he let his Wi-Fi get <strong>HACKED</strong> due to his own foolishness?
</p>

<p align="justify">
  What do you do with people who out of their own ignorance or complacency choose not to secure their own networks and cry fowl when somebody a little smarter gets the better of them. <strong>Is this hacking?</strong>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Enabling <strong>WEP</strong> security is the least one can do. How hard is it to set an encrypted key once and note it down in your cell. I know people who blame technology when they themselves are oblivious to their own ignorance. <strong>Your own system is the first line of defense and acts like a sitting duck if not secured properly. </strong>

  Coming back to the &#8216;Hari Om&#8217; network. I opened up Firefox and punched in : 192.168.1.1. It prompted for a username password. I &#8216;hacked&#8217; that too. Wish to know how? Simple enough. It was what 80% people have, their default credentials :
</p>

**Username : admin  
Passswors :admin**

****

<p align="justify">
  Then, it didn&#8217;t take much time for me to figure out his ISP – MTNL, the IP Address, his phone number (from the username), the plan he was using (using register.bol.net.in). Getting the password out of those *****(Astrix) was a simple task. There are many free tools available on the net which let you show the hidden password in the active window.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  So, now you tell me. Is this what you call HACKING? I guess, if you take care to secure your own network by following simple methods. It would take some serious hacking skills to get to the heart of your router. Keeping your WiFi open is like suicide. Just the same as keeping the door unlocked at night.

  <strong>If everyday, you can lock your doors before saying goodnight , is setting a one-time WEP key too much to ask for?</strong>
