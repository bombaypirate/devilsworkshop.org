&#8220;Ah! I have sent the mail which I shouldn&#8217;t have sent!&#8221; &#8211; How many of you have thought of this when you send a wrong email to a person?

Answer is most of us. Think if we could just pull back our email and be more cautious next time. Your wishes are granted as Google has just <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-in-labs-undo-send.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-in-labs-undo-send.html', 'rolled out']);" >rolled out</a> a new lab feature where we can undo the sent mail and avoid mistakes!

Though this Undo button cant pull back the email which is already sent, but gives you some 5 seconds time to &#8220;**Undo&#8221;** it and then the message disappears and the mail is sent.

As all the Lab features, you will have to select it and &#8216;turn it on&#8217; to function. You can do it by going to your Lab setting page of your Gmail account.

**Added  by Editor: **How about Gmail giving option to specify delay? 5 seconds is too small! What do you think?**
