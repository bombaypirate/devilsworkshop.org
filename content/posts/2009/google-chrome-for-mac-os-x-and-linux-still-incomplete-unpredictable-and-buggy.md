Although Google has released Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux, **it has been advised NOT to download these versions yet**, as it is just an early preview for developers to seek more feedback in order to fix the bugs in it.

The coders at Google are still working on rebuild some bug free Chrome components like its graphical interface and its sandbox that isolates different processes from each other, to move beyond just Windows. Google said there are more than <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=OS:Linux,Mac" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=OS:Linux,Mac', '400 bugs that need to be fixed.']);" >400 bugs that need to be fixed.</a>

> **Google’s Mike Smith and Karen Grunberg, Product Managers say:**

> *“We have early developer channel versions of Google Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux, but whatever you do, please DON&#8217;T DOWNLOAD THEM! Unless of course you are a developer or take great pleasure in incomplete, unpredictable, and potentially crashing software.”*

### Google offers three versions of Chrome

  1. The Stable Version
  2. The Beta Version
  3. The Developer Preview Version

The Mac OS X and Linux versions fall into this last category, which is the most incomplete, buggy and least tested.

Recently, Google launched a [new and improved version of Chrome][1] for Windows that is said to be faster, safer and less prone to bugs. The [earlier versions of Chrome had many security issues][2] around it stirring up critical vulnerabilities.

### Chrome’s unfinished business – how incomplete is it?

  * You can’t view YouTube videos as the Flash component won&#8217;t work yet.
  * You can’t change your privacy settings
  * You can’t set your default search provider
  * You can’t even print or bookmark

This is actually the wise step taken by Google towards creating a bug free browser. People (developers) from all over will now help the Google chrome team to fix the faults, as a result help in creating stable beta release for more people to try.
