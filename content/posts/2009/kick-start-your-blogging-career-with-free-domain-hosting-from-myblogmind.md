Still there are bloggers who are on free platforms like <a href="http://www.blogger.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blogger.com', 'Blogspot']);" >Blogspot</a> and <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wordpress.com', 'WordPress.com']);" >WordPress.com</a> . Well, Blogspot and WordPress.com will work fine if you have just started to know about blogging and trying your hands on different aspects of it. But if you want to get into serious blogging, you should consider getting a top level domain and hosting for your domain. <a href="http://www.myblogmind.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.myblogmind.com', 'MyBlogMind']);" >MyBlogMind</a> came up with a great offer for all bloggers, it&#8217;s providing **free domains and hosting up to 1 year** to bloggers, no hidden charges ever!

There are bloggers who can&#8217;t make it to buy a domain or hosting because reasons like credit card problems, no paypal balance etc. Just to support these bloggers **MyBlogMind** has been partnered with GoDaddy and Hostgator to provide free domains and hosting.

### Here are some key features of MyBlogMind :

  1. **You choose the domain** and they get your domain registered for the 1st year
  2. **Free hosting account** with complete cPanel (unlimited space and bandwidth)
  3. **Free $25 Google Adwords credit** to promote your blog
  4. **No forced Ads** on your site. Show your ads on your blog only
  5. **Free SEO tools** and tutorials to make your blog popular
  6. No contracts are made. **You own your site** contents
  7. **24*7 support team** to help you in case of problems

As far as I think, this is the best offer you can get this summer. All domains will be kept under their accounts for first three months (to prevent spamming) and will be pushed to your GoDaddy account for free after three months. All hosting accounts come for free for the committed period and you don&#8217;t have to pay a single penny for this.

Note : MyBlogMind took birth this month and hence you can expect the following things this month.

  1. **25 free domains and 25 free hosting accounts** for this month
  2. They will provide **.info domains** in June (All domain extensions will be made available from August)
  3. Free hosting for 2 months to everyone while **top 5 bloggers will get 1 year free hosting** (1 year free hosting will be made available to everyone from August)
