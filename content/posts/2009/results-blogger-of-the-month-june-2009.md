If you missed it, from last month we started a contest &#8211; [Blogger of The Month][1], on rtBlogs Network named.

We are glad to see response you guys gave for this initiative. **26** authors published **49** posts on **3** blogs in our network in **June 2009**.

[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11972" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c603cefc27361f1ea72377de6403a101?s=96&d=&r=G" alt="himanshu-kalra" width="96" height="96" />][2]But as per rules of the contest, only one person could win the** $100** cash prize. We are glad to announce that the winner is [Himanshu Kalra][2] who published **11 posts** under the name [TooYoungGeek][2]. He is just **14 years old** and that makes him youngest blogger in our network* (correct me if I am wrong!)*.

### The Clarification&#8230;

So whats now! We received some questions from fellow blogger during the contest and I like to re-answer one of them publicly. Some bloggers thought this $100 reward initiative is replacement for our earlier revenue sharing program. Here is the clarification&#8230;

The **$100** prize is to **encourage** new bloggers to take blogging seriously. A fellow blogger asked if we are trying to **buy** posts. The answer is **NO**. All posts published by guest bloggers anytime in our network will carry their AdSense ads and links forever.

So in the end, **Himanshu** will receive **$100** reward form our network and will continue to get ad receive generated from his posts directly. All other participants who missed bonus prize will still make some bucks from ad on their posts!

### Cheat Codes&#8230;

We have changed our algorithm slightly this month. Let me tell you insider secrets! Post like *&#8220;Top 10 Tools&#8221;*** **or* &#8220;Top 5 Sites&#8221;* i.e. listing will carry more points. Of course original [tutorial like this one][3] published by [Arjun][4] last month will carry highest points. We also decided to reduce points given to news posts, as we have noticed no one is interested in news kinda stuff!

We will be also giving points to number of comments your posts attract so be responsive when someone submit a comment on your post. Earlier you answer to a use comment, more comments you often get.

One more thing we observed that neither quality nor quantity alone can help you win the contest!So bets of luck for **July 2009 contest!** <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
