Contact Form is must for every blog in order to provide a platform for the users to interact with the owner of the blog. In  WordPress one can use Contact Form 7 Plugin and can place them in the menu bar or can embed in the posts wherever necessary by installing this plugin, where as for blogger blogs there were no tailor made plugins to insert contact form/pages. One has to edit the Html or create their own custom code to do this.
