As I am a tech geek, almost 80% of my subscribed feeds are related to tech stuff and includes feeds of almost all the popular tech blogs and websites. So I was thinking and thinking about what to look for and what to search for?

  Guess what? Google solved my problem. I landed into an interesting post at Digital Inspiration that described on how you can Get RSS Feed Suggestions Based on your Existing Subscriptions. The post really helped me figure out some important and good tech blogs that I missed out to subscribe, and this is why I considered writing about it here.

  You just need to visit <a href="http://suggestrss.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://suggestrss.com/', 'SuggestRSS']);" target="_blank">SuggestRSS</a>, upload your existing OPML file into it and within seconds a cool list of sites would be generated that you can subscribe to. The suggestions that SuggestRSS generates is based on your OPML file so, the suggestions that you would get will be based on your interest. <a href="http://suggestrss.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://suggestrss.com/', 'This site']);" target="_blank">This site</a> helped me in getting some more readable posts of my interest and hope this would be helpful for you guys too.
