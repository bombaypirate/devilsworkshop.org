No, this article is not about **Artificial Intelligence** making it&#8217;s way to the internet but about a website which tries to give you an opinion on what the internet thinks about a certain keyword using search results. The great thing about these search results are it mixes search results form <a href="http://google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com', 'Google Search']);" >Google Search</a>, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://search.yahoo.com', 'Yahoo search']);" >Yahoo search</a> and <a href="http://bing.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bing.com', 'Bing']);" >Bing</a>.

This is fun and interesting way to look up how a particular issue or topic is viewed positively and negatively across the search spectrum.

### <a href="http://www.whatdoestheinternetthink.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whatdoestheinternetthink.net/', 'What does the Internet Think?']);" >What does the Internet Think?</a>

  * &#8220;<a href="http://www.whatdoestheinternetthink.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whatdoestheinternetthink.net/', 'What does the Internet think?']);" >What does the Internet think?</a>&#8221; is a website which tries to analyse a search keyword from three points of views. They are positive, negative and indifferent.
  * The implications are quite interesting. This does not take into account how popular the search keyword is but if opinions are **positive** or **negative** towards that keyword.
  * For example if I searched for &#8216;**Open Source**&#8216; with **Google** the results were overwhelmingly positive whereas when I searched the same with **Bing** the negative and positive percentage were almost equal.
  * This means that people using different search engines have different views and opinions on one particular subject. This website is a great way to get a straw poll of those different views. For instance if you are a blogger and a majority of your traffic comes from **Bing**, you might want to tone down your criticism of **Microsoft&#8217;s **products or softwares which are not open source.
  * That said I do not think that if you are blogger, using this tool will help you optimize your website&#8217;s listing on a search engine. It is only a rough guide or indicative poll.
