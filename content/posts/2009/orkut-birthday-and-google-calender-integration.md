Just noticed on Orkut&#8217;s upcoming birthday section a link saying &#8211; **<span class="btn">&#8220;view your friends&#8217; birthdays in Google Calendar&#8221;</span>**

**<span class="btn"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-54373" style="border: 1px solid black" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/orkut-birthday-google-calender-integration.png" alt="orkut-birthday-google-calender-integration" width="439" height="339" /><br /> </span>**

<span class="btn">Clicking on it took me to a Google Calender page confirming integration of Orkut friends birthdays with Google calender.</span>

**<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/03/google-calendar-confirmation-1.png" alt="google-calendar-confirmation-1" width="348" height="106" />  
**

**<span class="btn">There are few advantages of this integration because Google Calender</span>**

  1. <span class="btn">Can send birthday reminder via SMS/Email</span>
  2. <span class="btn">Can be synced with other services/softwares like outlook on Windows, iCal on Mac, etc.</span>
  3. <span class="btn">Have official API which can be used to develop third-party applications</span>

There may be more to it! Let us know, if you can figure it out! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
