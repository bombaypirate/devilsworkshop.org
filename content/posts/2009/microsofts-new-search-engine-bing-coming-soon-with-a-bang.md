<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9508" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/05/image9.jpg" alt="image9" width="162" height="101" />In the past several months, Microsoft has been trying to revamp its search engine to counter the dominance of Google. [Microsoft’s underground “secret-testing” of the new search engine, code-named “Kumo”][1] will be introduced in the market re-named as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/may09/05-28NewSearchPR.mspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/may09/05-28NewSearchPR.mspx', 'BING']);" title="Microsoft Bing Press Release"  target="_self">BING</a>!

The service will be available at <a href="http://www.bing.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bing.com/', 'www.bing.com']);" >www.bing.com</a>. Microsoft is calling its new product a “decision engine,” promising to make things like buying a digital camera, booking a flight or searching for a restaurant easier by serving up results based on similar previous searches.

### Marketing budget to promote Bing

Microsoft is planning to spend $80 million to $100 million on ad campaigning to promote Bing!

Gulp!!! Now, that’s a lot of money. Let’s wait to see how much buzz it will really create.

### Latest Stats

  * Last month Google took 64.2 % of US Internet searches
  * Yahoo took 20.4 % of searches
  * Microsoft took 8.2 % of searches

### Some new Bing features

The competition is really tough for Microsoft, especially with both Google and [Yahoo recently introducing new features in their search engines][2] to attract users.

  * Microsoft is calling its new product a &#8220;decision engine.” For example: A search on a make of car will give you clickable categories (on the left-hand sidebar) like 
      * problems
      * reviews
      * dealers
  * These are the most likely places a Web user will want to go from the initial search.
  * You will be able to use the popular Farecast service in its flight booking section which predicts whether fares will rise or fall.
  * You could also get directions to locations with only one mouse click, and hover over a search results to see more information, without having to open a new link.

Microsoft hopes to universally ***verbify*** the new name Bing, like Google, which has now become the generic verb for searching the Internet for information. *“I was googling all night and came up with this report.”*

Determined to make it big this time, Microsoft is all set to introduce Bing with a bang to the public next Wednesday. I really can’t wait to see what lies beneath their secret covers.
