You could keep a “book wish list”. Once you have enough points or /and the books are available in the stock, it will automatically arrive to you.

### **The give and take policy**

Every time you ship someone a book, you earn a point that you can use to get any book you want from anyone else at BookMooch. Once you&#8217;ve read a book, you can keep it forever or put it back into BookMooch for someone else to read. In order to keep receiving books, you need to give away at least one book for every three you receive.

### **The worldwide network**

  * You can request books from other countries, in other languages.
  * You receive extra points when you send a book out of your country.

Membership is required, which is again completely free. You will receive your first book after typing in 10 books you&#8217;re giving away.

So, let’s get started.
