You may have heard that Facebook gives importance to Privacy. That&#8217;s the reason why many of us like it. They allows us to customize most of the widgets and information in the profile page easily.

But had you ever thought that you could even edit the widget like the &#8216;Friends&#8217; box, which shows random result. Facebook has options for this too. Even though many other social networking sites like like orkut, twitter etc too have these features, only Facebook values our privacy and helps us customize this.

Remember that, there are many users who evaluate you, just by looking at your friends. They may rate you just by checking your friends. If they see a &#8216;John Chow&#8217; or &#8216;Problogger&#8217;, you may be someone respectful for them and if your profile shows pictures of your colleagues (it&#8217;s random, so it can be anyone), they will surely skip you. So instead of all these just** highlight the pictures of some friends, whom everyone respects and make others see only them in your &#8216;Friends&#8217; box, in the profile page.**

** ** This is not a trick but it is just an option provided by Facebook itself. With this, you can** Display Pictures of selected friends only on your Facebook Profile Page.**** **

  * Go** **to facebook.com and sign-in to your profile
  * Scroll down the cursor and find the &#8216;Friends&#8217; labeled box
  * Now, you may see the picture of a pencil in the right hand side of the title (see the picture)

![Display selected friends only in your facebok profile, always !][1]

  * Now, you may see a new drop-down menu
  * select the box  &#8216;Always show these friends&#8217;
  * Type-in the name of your friends whom you want to show in your facebook profile page permanently.

If you want to show the selected friends only, just select them as told here and in the &#8216;Show *<span style="text-decoration: underline"> 6 </span> * Friends&#8217;, change the number to the number of friends you selected. Then the box can only display the friends you selected.
