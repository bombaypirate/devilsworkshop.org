  Who wouldn't like to hear people making predictions about the future? I guess, most curious minds would. But have we ever gone back to check if any of these foretelling's actually came true? I suppose not! We often tend to read today and forget tomorrow, and hardly anyone keeps track!
  
  But now, there is an easy way to keep a check. This really cool website - Wrong Tomorrow: Time vs. Pundits - does just that for you.

Who wouldn&#8217;t like to hear people making predictions about the future? I guess, most curious minds would. But have we ever gone back to check if any of these foretelling&#8217;s actually came true? I suppose not! We often tend to read today and forget tomorrow, and hardly anyone keeps track!

But now, there is an easy way to keep a check. This really cool website &#8211; <a href="http://wrongtomorrow.com/predictions" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wrongtomorrow.com/predictions', 'Wrong Tomorrow: Time vs. Pundits']);" title="Wrong Tomorrow"  target="_self">Wrong Tomorrow: Time vs. Pundits</a> &#8211; does just that for you.

### More about this site&#8230;

This website is run by a guy called Maciej Ceglowski. His site records and keeps track of the predictions of the future made by famous people, and over time, checks and confirms if any of them ever came true.

### How does it work?

Over the globe, there are many known public figures making all kinds of predictions about the future &#8211; be it technology, politics, finance, social events or others. When someone makes a prediction, and you catch it, it can be posted on this site. All it needs is a brief description of the prediction made, by whom and the URL of your authentic source of information. The website then monitors it, and over time, changes its status to true or false when appropriate.

### Here&#8217;s an example&#8230;

<a href="http://wrongtomorrow.com/authors/steven-j-vaughan-nichols" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wrongtomorrow.com/authors/steven-j-vaughan-nichols', 'A prediction was made by Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols']);" title="Prediction"  target="_self">A prediction was made by Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols</a> (Cyber Cynic) on April 4, 2009, where he said,

&#8220;By this time next week, IBM will have bought Sun at a cut-rate price.&#8221;

This was proved &#8220;**wrong**&#8220;. The IBM-Sun deal fell through the weekend after this prediction was made.

### You could post a prediction too&#8230;

Just make sure the prediction is:

  1. **Authentic**
  2. **Important in effect and meaning**
  3. **Made by a public figure**
  4. **Testable within 5 yrs**

The prediction strictly needs to follow the rules or it will be dumped into the â€˜rejected&#8217; queue.

I think it&#8217;s quite an innovative concept Maciej Ceglowski has come up with. But, only time will tell how interesting things can get and if this site can really serve the purpose of holding media and public figures accountable &#8220;for predicting to see into an unpredictable future.&#8221;
