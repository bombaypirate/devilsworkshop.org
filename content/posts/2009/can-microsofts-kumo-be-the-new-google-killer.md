Looks like someone’s been working very hard on trying to catch up with (or even beat) the Internet search leaders Google and Yahoo!

### Kumo to create a &#8216;buzz&#8217; in the market

Microsoft is most likely to reveal its “top secret” project – the new version of its Internet search engine to the public sometime next week. Microsoft (through JWT ad agency) is even getting an advertizing campaign ready for the product, hoping to create some “extra” buzz in the market, when they do decide to come out in the open!

### Back in the past…

****

  * In 2003, Microsoft passed up the chance to buy search engines Inktomi and Overture (from whom MS contracted search services) and let Yahoo acquire them. With those under rival Yahoo’s wing, Microsoft was forced to build its own search service.
  * In 2004, Microsoft launched its own homegrown search engine but MSN search engine failed to gain ground and compete against Yahoo, much less Google.
  * In 2008, Microsoft attempted $45 billion hostile takeover of Yahoo. When that ended weakly, the company announced it would start paying consumers to use its search engine.

And now comes their very own ‘Kumo’ with a fate still undecided.

### Can Microsoft&#8217;s search engine beat Google?

I think initially, it will be quite an achievement for Microsoft to match up the levels of Yahoo search. Even with Kumo, Microsoft might still be far from being a “Google killer”.

What do you think? Can Microsoft actually come back with a bang with “Kumo” and match up the levels of Google? Do share your thoughts on the subject.
