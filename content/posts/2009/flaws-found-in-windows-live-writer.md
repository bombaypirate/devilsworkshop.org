  <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/windows-live-writer-best-desktop-blogging-client-for-offline-blogging/" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> (WLW), one of the famous desktop blogging client for Windows users that made lives of pro bloggers really easy and comfortable. But have you ever realized there is a major flaw discovered in Windows Live Writer that may sometime put you in trouble? If you have ever used WLW, you must be aware, it has an inbuilt option to set the publishing time of particular posts, that will automatically get published on the desired date and time. But a few days ago, while going offline for a day or two, when I tried publishing a future dated post, it got published immediately. I was just wondering about how this could happen and started blaming myself, thinking I must have not set the option to publish on a future date.

  But after a few days, while publishing another post, I was confirmed that the fault was not mine, rather a flaw in WLW made the scheduled post to publish immediately. Even the <a href="http://www.windowslive.com/connect/post/jasperintheclubhouse.spaces.live.com-Blog-cns!AF3477F112EE7C45!171.entry" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.windowslive.com/connect/post/jasperintheclubhouse.spaces.live.com-Blog-cns!AF3477F112EE7C45!171.entry', 'Windows Live Writer blog']);" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer blog</a> has confirmed about a fault in WLW that, sometimes, made scheduled posts get published immediately. WLW team members have assured that the bug will be rectified as soon as possible and have also suggested on <a href="http://www.windowslive.com/connect/post/jasperintheclubhouse.spaces.live.com-Blog-cns!AF3477F112EE7C45!171.entry" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.windowslive.com/connect/post/jasperintheclubhouse.spaces.live.com-Blog-cns!AF3477F112EE7C45!171.entry', 'what you can do, if you too face such problems']);" target="_blank">what you can do, if you too face such problems</a>. So, if you are a blogger too, using WLW to schedule posts, then be careful next time.
