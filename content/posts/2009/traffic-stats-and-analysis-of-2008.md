Year 2008, has been amazing year for Devils Workshop. It started with around 200,000 visitors count on sitemeter and out of the blue a thought crossed my mind â€“ ***Can I make sitemeter counter cross 1 million visitor count! ***

Surprisingly, at the end of year we were very close to 1 million markâ€¦ ***970,585***! We fell short by just 30K or in positive words, 1 million mark will be crossed in second week of Jan, hopefully!

Considering little downtime and my own unavailability for around 2 months, I must say Devils Workshop met its traffic goal for 2008, and credit goes to our more than **20** co-bloggers, **3000+** readers and of course our more than **700,000+** visitors!

So its time to do in-depth analysis of traffic so that we can cater to right audience using right-platforms next year!

## Total Trafficâ€¦

### Google Search

Like most tech-blogs, Devils Workshop too gets maximum of its traffic via Google Search. Dear Google sent **498,144** visitors which made **67.12%** of our total visitors! An acknowledgement for my SEO efforts! ðŸ˜‰

### StumbleUponâ€¦

Although I stopped spending much time on social-bookmarking sites like Digg, StumbleUopn, etc, our one post reviewing Top 5 Torrent Search Engine, received a lot of love of love from StumbleUpon community making it **#1** referral site for direct traffic. We received **26,078** visitors from StumbleUpon which is **3.51%** of total visitors.

### Other Referrals

Next comes <a href="http://userscripts.org/users/5398/scripts" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/users/5398/scripts', 'userscripts.org']);" >userscripts.org</a> where we host [greasemonkey scripts][3] developed by us, my old blog <a href="http://rb286.blogspot.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rb286.blogspot.com', 'rb286.blogspot.com']);" >rb286.blogspot.com</a> from where I still get consist traffic because of my own wordpress plugin developed to [maintain permalinks while moving from blogger to wordpress][4], followed by Orkut which is our favorite topic for blogging!

Just for info, we love Orkut so much that we just launched a dedicated blog for Orkut â€“ <a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/welcome-to-orkutdiary/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/welcome-to-orkutdiary/', 'Orkut Diary']);" ><strong>Orkut Diary</strong></a>**!**

## Traffic Goals for 2009!

Last year, we almost met goals we havenâ€™t setup seriously! Lets see what happens this year when we are seriously setting up goal to cross 3 million count for visitors and 10000 count for subscribers!

Well getting 2 million visitors seems easier than gaining 7000 subscribers. But with your support, we can hope to meet our goal! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

By the way, use <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/analytics/', 'Google Analytics']);" >Google Analytics</a> for must to track your traffic. No other free tracking service comes even close to Google Analytics!

**Recommended:** <a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/', 'Check Orkut Diary &#8211; our newly launched blog for Orkut!']);" >Check Orkut Diary &#8211; our newly launched blog for Orkut!</a>
