Just when everybody thought **Android** applications were nice but niche out comes **Google** with something truly revolutionary. The technology has existed but its application has been more or less nil. An **Android** application called **<a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/#landmark" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/#landmark', 'Google Googles']);" >Google Googles</a>** has captured a lot of attention of many gadget lovers.

  * Google Goggles is an application which can be used if your phone runs Android 1.6.
  * You can just point your mobile phone camera and take a snap of something you want to search.
  * Google will search and give results for the same. Just pointing the camera to certain local businesses gives you a prompt on the phone to look up information related to it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### The implications of Google Goggles

  * The implication of **Google Goggles **is huge and the potential is almost limitless. This technology bundled with **Google Maps** or **Google Earth** could revolutionize map navigation even more than it has already.
  * For instance if you were driving in a unfamiliar city and were lost. Just a click an image and you would get an exact idea of where you are. If you were browsing through products in the supermarket and needed more exacting information about a brand, you could just take a pic and search the details with your phone.
  * Even more impressive yet controversial could be facial recognition. Take a picture and you might get the name of the person especially if someone has his or her pics online and are tagged.
  * This really opens a lot of doors for technology to be implemented in many ways we might not have anticipated. The best part for Google is the potential for revenues with this sort of technology if implemented on a large scale could be huge.
