Vidteq provides unique and innovative navigation concept based on Video Maps. Video Maps are rich navigable maps built on a traditional digital map. It offers a video clip of the complete route between source and destination with business logos, background music, turn-by-turn audio overlay and road names embedded into it.

If you are driving and someone (or GPS direction) tells you to take a particular road, say – “Old Mysore Road”, it would still have been easy to follow the directions, provided all the streets were marked with clearly visible street nameplates. That is usually not the case in the smaller cities of India. This is where the video maps would come in handy.

Vidteq currently supports content only for Bangalore and provides a list of prominent businesses, points of interest with their accurate location and also their photographs.

So, all those in Bangalore can explore the streets, i.e. virtually navigate through the streets using the video clips and find out what is where even before you step out of the door.

Hope to see Vidteq rolling out such maps for other cities of India soon.
