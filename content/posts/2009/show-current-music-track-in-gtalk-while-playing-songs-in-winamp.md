It means, if your song track changes, automatically your status message too gets changed. 

But as of now, this feature worked only with Windows’ inbuilt media player – Windows Media Player. So what about those who don’t like Windows Media Player and also people like me who rather prefer using ‘Winamp’? As of now I thought, this is not possible, but Manoj advised a tweak using which this feature could be used even while using Winamp. 

Just follow these simple steps before you could start using it:

  1. <div>
      Go to Winamp root directory, mostly it is <strong>C:Program FilesWinamp</strong>
    </div>

  2. <div>
      Select <strong>Tools-> Folder Options –> View</strong> (Tab) and uncheck the “Hide extensions for known file types” option and click OK.
    </div>

  3. <div>
      Create an empty text file (Notepad file) on Winamp folder and rename it as “<strong>winamp.m3u</strong>” and save it.
    </div>

  4. <div>
      Now restart your Gtalk and Winamp and start using “Show current music track” option. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
    </div>

  By following the above 4 simple steps, you can tweak Gtalk to show current music track while playing songs in Winamp media player.
