Here&#8217;s a fun and practical Android app for all you college goers who want to keep track of your class attendance &#8211; that is, letting you safely bunk classes. It&#8217;s called Bunk-o-Meter.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-77780" alt="Bunk-O-Meter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/09/media-20130921-337x600.png" width="337" height="600" />][1]

<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Getting started is simple, you just have to enter your Semester&#8217;s subjects and the bunk limit for each of those. Next time you bunk a class, you can hit the + button and it&#8217;ll record it.</span>

You can set the app to throw a notification every day, reminding you if you&#8217;ve bunked any classes.

The app is nicely done, with neat transitions from screen-to-screen. It also throws some funny comment once in a while, as you can see in the screenshot above. Adding to this, there&#8217;s a quick tutorial in the beggining.

In short, Bunk-o-Meter does one thing and does it right.

So if you&#8217;re a student and using an Android, go grab it for free.
