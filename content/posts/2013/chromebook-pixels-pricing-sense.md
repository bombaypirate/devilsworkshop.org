As Google [unveiled Chromebook Pixel][1], a high end laptop that is priced very high at $1299 (WIFI) and $1499 for LTE version. The high price for the laptop is attracting a lot of criticism and even I at first wondered what exactly was Google doing here.

It has only 64GB internal memory, it runs on Chrome OS which is basically a juiced up browser. Add a couple of hundred dollars to the that price tag and one could by a MacBook.

### So why would someone pay $1299 for a Chromebook Pixel?

  * The answer is simple. Google offers 1 TB cloud storage for 3 years with Google Drive.
  * The pricing for Google Drive&#8217;s 1 TB package is **$49.99** on a monthly basis (*<a href="https://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2375123&p=mktg_pricing" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2375123&p=mktg_pricing', 'Google Drive Pricing']);" >Google Drive Pricing</a>*).
  * So for one year storage, the pricing will be **$599.88**.
  * Multiply it by three years and that goes up to **$1799.64**

So basically, if I was someone who purchased 1 TB storage space on Google Drive, it might be a great idea to buy Chromebook Pixel just for the storage. The awesome display touch-screen laptop is a bonus.

I am not sure how many people buy 1TB storage space on Google Drive, but I am sure Google has taken a calculated risk at wooing those high-end cloud users onto Chromebook Pixel.

Do you still think Chromebook Pixel is over-priced? Do drop in your comments.
