Google will soon start rolling out a new Image search layout for desktop browsers. This will firstly make the experience of looking up images on tablets platforms and desktop browsers uniform. This actually leverages the [current redesign of Google&#8217;s search options][1] showing up at the top instead of on the side.

Here is the new format that we all will start seeing in the near future for Google Images

### [<img class="wp-image-70886 aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="Google_Image_Search_NewDesign" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/01/Google_Image_Search_NewDesign.jpg" width="576" height="310" />][2]

### 

The images will be shown inline and navigation by using keyboard will make looking up results a lot simpler.

### Winners and Losers

Google will show the full sized images inline instead of displaying the image against a whitened backdrop of the original page. That was actually impacting the server load as it showed up &#8216;ghost&#8217; visits to websites. This ideally would not be very harmful for blogs and similar websites but sites known for storing public photos might find this a better deal.

But that does not mean everyone will be happy with this change. If you clicked on a small image, it took you to a page where the image is from. This is a great way for many websites get a lot of visitors to their own domains. Google is trying to appease their concerns by making the domain name clickable and also display a button to visit the original page.

That said from a user experience point of view, this change is for the better.

Have you seen this new format for <a href="http://images.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://images.google.com/', 'Google Search for Images']);" >Google Search for Images</a>? Do drop in your comments.
