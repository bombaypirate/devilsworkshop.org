There is no denying that Apple makes gorgeous, best in functionality keyboards. Both the wired and wireless Apple keyboards are amazing when it comes to working with the Macs and iOS devices.

Bootcamp drivers do a great job in making Apple keyboards work well in Windows, but there are a few glitches in key mapping. What can one do to solve this?

Apple Wireless Keyboard Helper is here to the rescue. It is a simple app available for Windows. Once the app is run, all the missing Windows functionality in the Apple keyboards will be available. You can now take screenshots, control your volume, iTunes, eject CD/DVD drive and even go to the task manager. The entire key combinations is shown below :

> F3 : Printscreen
> 
> F4 : Task Manager
> 
> F7 &#8211; F9 : iTunes control
> 
> F10 &#8211; F12 : System volume control
> 
> Eject : Toggles Functions / F Keys
> 
> Fn + F key triggers function (useful when in F keys mode)
> 
> Fn + Backspace : Delete
> 
> Fn + Eject : Eject CD

Right clicking the icon in the system tray will show you options to **Restart**, **Refresh connection** and **Exit**. You can enable/disable these key controls by navigating to the **Configuration** section.

There is also one amazing feature. Whenever you take a screenshot, adjust your system volume, play/pause songs or access the task manager, there is a good animation shown like in the Mac OS/iOS devices.

There is something that you should note. Apple Wireless Keyboard Helper [needs .NET 4][2] and above installed on your computer.
