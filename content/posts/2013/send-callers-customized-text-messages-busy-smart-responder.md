Smart Responder is an app that disconnects an incoming phone call and sends a text message to the caller if the phone user is busy, for example driving a car or is in a meeting.

By default, 5 instances come packed with the app. They are : Driving, Meeting, Theatre, Prayer, School. When you&#8217;re at the temple, you may choose the Prayer mode to disconnect the calls and an auto-response &#8216;At Prayer&#8217; will be sent. Similarly, you can choose the other instances. But at one time, you may choose only one particular instance.

Also, you can create your own instances. You should give a *Title* and a *Message* to create instances of your own. You can also long press the pre-loaded 5 instances to change the Title / Message.

Deleting the default 5 instances is not possible which is unfortunate as not everyone is blogs or is still young enough to be in school or college but the app allows deleting instances created by yourself.

Once you&#8217;re done with all your jobs, you may disable the enabled instances and you can close the app.
