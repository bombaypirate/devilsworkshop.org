Since Windows 8 supports touch-screen inputs, a screen capture software that works on say Windows 7 might not be suitable. I personally use [Skitch for Windows][1], as it is free. Today, I tried out Windows Screen Capture Tool, which is a portable software that works on Windows 7 and Windows 8.

### Windows Screen Capture Tool Features

  * Install the software from this <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/downloads/WSCTS.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thewindowsclub.com/downloads/WSCTS.zip', 'download link']);" rel="nofollow">download link</a> (.zip file). It is portable and needs [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0][2] on your computer.
  * The Screen Capture tool is metro styled and allow a range of options from full-screen capture, area capture, adding a watermark and Window Capture
  * There is support for keyboard short-cuts but with touch-screens for Windows 8, they might not be used as much.
  * The software allows insertion of text based watermarks on images.
  * The really nice feature of this software was that I found useful was that it could take screenshots with or without the cursor.
  * The only downside of this screen-capture tool was that it does not have a time-lapse feature that takes a screen-capture after say five or ten seconds.

If you have a Windows 8/7 desktop and need a portable software that works with metro UI, then try this one out.
