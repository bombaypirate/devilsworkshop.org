If you are one of those who wants to buy the new Nexus 5 phone or the Nexus 7 tablet, you should head over to the Google Play Store. Though I expected the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 to [debut on 14th November][1] Â but that date seemed off by a week. It might have ended up missing the shopping frenzy in India but Android enthusiasts were probably aware the Nexus phone will show up

### Nexus 5 in India

The Nexus 5 phone running the latest Android 4.4 KitKat is available in two variants with 16 GB and 32 GB memory storage. While I checked Google Play store, the phone was not available in black colour but was available with white. The price of the 16 GB phone was as [expected][1] **Rs. 28,999** and the 32 GB is priced **Rs. 32,999**.

### Nexus 7 (2013) in India

The Nexus 7 tablet&#8217;s latest 2013 version was released a few months ago in the US. The device runs Android 4.3 Jellybean but it will have an assured update to Android 4.4 KitKat. The tablet is available in three different varieties. The 16 GB variant is available in WiFi only and the 32GB variant is available in WiFi and also another one with LTE unlocked (GSM).

**Pricing**

  * Nexus 7 16 GB WiFi &#8211; **Rs. 20,999**
  * Nexus 7 32 GB WiFi &#8211; **Rs. 23,999**
  * Nexus 7 32 GB LTE + WiFi &#8211; **Rs. 27,999**

The Nexus 7 32 GB LTE + WiFi version is a pretty good deal. I personally ordered myself a Nexus 7 32 GB WiFi tablet and when its delivered, you can expect a complete review.

### Old Nexus 7 tablets are a bargain

While the new Nexus 7 is far superior to its last years predecessor, it still is a handy tablet to have. The best part of the old Nexus 7 are being sold at prices as low as Rs. 8,999. I saw that price on <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/nexus-7-tablet/p/itmdp6sywb5ywchh?pid=TABDNGSUTBGZTFKT&otracker=from-search&srno=t_1&query=nexus+7+tablet&ref=0e75307e-b1e6-4afc-86e5-88b5ba066c91" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flipkart.com/nexus-7-tablet/p/itmdp6sywb5ywchh?pid=TABDNGSUTBGZTFKT&otracker=from-search&srno=t_1&query=nexus+7+tablet&ref=0e75307e-b1e6-4afc-86e5-88b5ba066c91', 'Flipkart']);" >Flipkart</a> but on <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Google-Nexus-Tablet-WiFi-16GB/dp/B00DB3SH2G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384966262&sr=8-1&keywords=Nexus+7" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.in/Google-Nexus-Tablet-WiFi-16GB/dp/B00DB3SH2G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384966262&sr=8-1&keywords=Nexus+7', 'Amazon.in']);" >Amazon.in</a> it was available for Rs. 11,299.
