Swiftkey, one of the most popular keyboards for Android, got updated to 4.0. The new version features gesture-based typing, better word suggestions and more.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-71673" alt="swiftkey-4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/02/Screenshot_2013-02-20-19-49-27-337x600.png" width="337" height="600" />][1]

Gesture-based typing was one of the big features which Swiftkey missed out previously, especially when even 4.2&#8217;s native keyboard had it. With this version, they&#8217;ve fixed it, introducing Swiftkey Flow.

There&#8217;s also &#8216;Flow through Space&#8217; which lets you gesture type without even having to lift the finger. It needs a little practise, but once you get used to it, you&#8217;ll be able to type super fast. You basically need to swipe from word to word through the space key.

Another neat addition is the split keyboard, which you probably expect on a tablet, but worked comfortably well when I tried on my Galaxy Nexus (should do well on any >4&#8243; device). It splits your keyboard in landscape mode, so you can type faster using two thumbs.

They have also added few themes, including a Holo theme (mimics 4.2&#8217;s native keyboard&#8217;s interface) which I really liked.

The app is priced at 0.99$ on the Playstore and is available for tablets too. It&#8217;s a free update for those who have already bought it.
