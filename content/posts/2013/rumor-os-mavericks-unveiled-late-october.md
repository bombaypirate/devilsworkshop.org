This might come as a surprise to some of you Apple/Mac enthusiasts. According to Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac, Apple is not going to release the final version of OS X Mavericks on 10th September.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-77548" alt="Mavericks" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/09/mav-600x363.jpg" width="600" height="363" />][1]

<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">A few days back, Apple has confirmed their special event on September 10th, where in they&#8217;re going to release the long rumored iPhone 5C aka the cheaper iPhone and iPhone 5S. While the iPhones will suck all the limelight, that doesn&#8217;t mean Apple&#8217;s going to not care about Macs.</span>

As the rumor suggests, Apple will probably host a special event just for unveiling all Mac related stuff. This includes the all new Mac Pro, OS X Mavericks and Haswell-powered MacBook Pros. Not to forget, Apple also has to share its earning report for Q4. So it seems all this is perfectly aligned.

OS X Mavericks was demoed at this year&#8217;s WWDC and [brings handful of features including Finder tabs][2], better Memory compression, iBooks, better Notification center and more.

So to sum it up, don&#8217;t hold your breath for OS X Mavericks, Apple will probably release 1-2 more Developer Previews before the final release.
