Rome2rio is a multi-modal travel search guide that aims at making travelling easy. rome2mio has a map based UI. You should enter the origin and destination places and it will be give you the travel combination of cars, buses, trains, ferries or planes that you should take.

The app also mentions you the amount of money that you should spend to reach your destination. The service splits the travel mode. It also mentions the amount of money that you should spend for each mode of transportation and then mentions the total amount. The airfares are taken from <a href="http://katak.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://katak.com/', 'Katak']);" title="Katak">Katak</a>.

Similarly, Indian train details are provided by Indian Railways. It gives you an option to enter the travel dates and it pulls the exact airfares from Katak. It features 670 airlines worldwide, and features trains in Europe, China and India. It also allows you to book your tickets straight away when you choose your dates and your preferred airlines.

Hotel bookings are also available.

It also gives you multiple choices of transportation/origin/destination and you can choose the one you prefer. For example, when I searched for a travel guide from Madurai, India to Tokyo, Japan, it gave me an option to land either at Tokyo Narita or at Tokyo Haneda.

The price tags are mentioned in USD by default. You can choose to change that to your preferred currency any time.

### How rome2rio stakes against Google Maps?

rome2rio is basically Google Maps with additional features. But the main advantage of rome2rio over Google Maps is that, the former gives you multi-modal travel options while Google Maps limits to one mode of travel. Also Google Maps doesn&#8217;t show fares and doesn&#8217;t allow bookings.
