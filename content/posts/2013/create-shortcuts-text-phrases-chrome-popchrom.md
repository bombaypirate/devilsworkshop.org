Chrome is my favourite browser and it has a great deal of options to improve productivity. Here are some of [my favourite productivity tips for Chrome][1]. Because I am using the browser a lot for writing blog post and answering email, I found ***Popchrom*** a really good extension. It allows me to create shortcuts for text phrases. For example, I have set the shortcut &#8220;DW&#8221; to expand into &#8220;Devils&#8217; Workshop&#8221; the full name of this blog.

**How it works:**

  * Install the [Popchrom][2] extension on your Chrome browser.
  * Then look up its options and add your customized shortcuts. There are some default ones like &#8220;sy&#8221; expands to &#8220;Sincerely yours&#8221; and &#8220;today&#8221; expands to the current data.
  * Once you type in the short form, just hit &#8220;***Ctrl + Space***&#8220;. This is a default and can be changed according to your preferences.
  * Usually, it makes sense to have some very common short forms for words or full sentences you might typing out too many times.

**Additional Tip:** If you sending similar emails all the time, you might want to check out Gmail&#8217;s canned response which can even be [used from your Android phone][3].
