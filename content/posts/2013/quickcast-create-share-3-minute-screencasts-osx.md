Most screensharing apps are complex, pricey and are targetted for professional video editors. If you ever want to quickly snap a video to share your screen with any one, you wouldn&#8217;t use something like Camtasia.

Quickcast, as the name suggests, lets you record and share screencasts in a jiffy!

The process is really simple, you select the part of screen to get recorded (or select whole screen), toggle Microphone and Camera on/off and start recording.

You can record for a maximum of 3 minutes and as recording is done, the video is automatically uploaded to its site and link is copied to clipboard.

There are some neat additions like, if your video&#8217;s length is than 10 seconds and the screencast area is less than 300x300px, Quickcast will output a GIF instead of a normal MP4 video file.

You can give title, description (in Markdown!) and tag the video.

Quickcast is free and <a href="https://github.com/petetak/quickcast" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/petetak/quickcast', 'open source']);" >open source</a>. It&#8217;s Mac-only right now, but because it&#8217;s open source, I&#8217;m sure some one will port it to Windows and Linux too.
