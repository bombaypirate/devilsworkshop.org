27th May is an important date for all WordPress enthusiasts. It&#8217;s the 10th anniversary of the most widely used CMS in the world. From a simple blogging platform to a pretty flexible CMS that drives many complex applications, WordPress, the application has evolved, tremendously.

I think of it as an apt occasion to present to you a story. It is the story of the evolution of the WordPress community in India. It is just my perspective and a point of view.

## A brief history of WordPress in India

I&#8217;m one of those users that hopped on to the WordPress bandwagon, quite early in the 2.x series. This is the time when WordPress was still a blog and the dashboard menus were horizontal. I know of a lot of users who were fiddling with WordPress, around then, but there weren&#8217;t many. These were days when everybody wanted to open a portal (like Yahoo, Indiatimes, Rediff, etc). That&#8217;s why Joomla was the most peddled platform, everywhere.

### The bloggers and the entrepreneurs: the Users

Somewhere down the line, blogging started becoming the &#8220;in&#8221; thing and the focus started shifting from portal like information centric sites to content centric, magazine/blog style sites. Blogger had just become a hit.

Further ahead, blogging started becoming a business. People who were professionally serious and/or passionate about blogging wanted more control on how their sites looked and behaved.

At the same times, elite small businesses were looking for better and cheaper ways of building their microsites. Coupled with better internet access, everyone was looking for a solution that was not as overwhelming as Joomla or Drupal. And I guess, logically and naturally, all these people gravitated towards WordPress.

### The Developers and the Designers: the providers

There was another scene developing gradually, in the background. A lot of new developers, designers and small agencies were discovering freelance marketplaces. The global demand for WordPress development was flooding the job posts on these sites. A lot of these were low-priced simple tasks that anyone could google the solution for and fix.

This system of SMEs outsourcing to SMEs propagated the ease with which WordPress sites could be designed, developed and deployed. These agencies then started proposing WordPress to the local customers, as well.

## Popularity means a lot of people

Beyond that, the reasons that made WordPress the most popular CMS in the world, also worked in India. Maybe, it was just a global trend and India just joined it.

This is a heady concoction: entrepreneurs, passionate bloggers, DIY developers (with no formal qualifications), designers and tinkerers. When a large number of such people start working with a single platform, they are bound to have opinions, views and insights. That gives birth to a *need* to share: give and take. To share, one must communicate. And, a lot of people spread across geographical areas, talking to each other, sharing knowledge and resources, is exactly what makes a community.

## The seeds of the community: WordCamp Delhi &#8217;09

The best communication is face to face communication. In spite of virtual communication, unless a community gathers together, the energy and the buzz of the community is never felt by its members. That&#8217;s why we have festivals, celebrations and other social events. In the case of WordPress, the shrewd business logic already had a system of meetups and most importantly, WordCamps.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74152" alt="wcindia" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/wcindia.png" width="218" height="218" />

A WordCamp had to happen in India, sooner or later and so it happened. The first WordCamp in India was called <a href="http://india.wordcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://india.wordcamp.org/', 'WordCamp India']);" title="First WordCamp India"  target="_blank">WordCamp India</a> and was an important affair. Held in the national capital, it boasted of sponsors like Adobe and Automattic and was organised by the Delhi Bloggers&#8217; group. The highlight of the event was the presence of none other than Matt Mullenweg.

Beyond that, I personally know nothing about this event. This was before Indians had taken to Twitter or Facebook, as enthusiastically, as now. Besides, googling did not yield much about the event.

## WordCamp Jabalpur &#8217;11

<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74153" alt="wcjabalpur" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/wcjabalpur.png" width="218" height="218" />Compared to the previous WordCamp, this one was more widely publicised and talked about. With participation from across India, </span><a href="http://2011.jabalpur.wordcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://2011.jabalpur.wordcamp.org/', 'WordCamp Jabalpur']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="WordCamp Jabalpur"  target="_blank">WordCamp Jabalpur</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"> featured, for the first time, some of the current WordCamp regulars like </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bankerrahul" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/bankerrahul', 'Rahul Banker']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="Rahul Banker"  target="_blank">Rahul Banker</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sgaurav.baghel" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/sgaurav.baghel', 'Gaurav Singh']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="Gaurav Singh"  target="_blank">Gaurav Singh</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"> (the organiser), </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecancerus" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/thecancerus', 'Amit Singh']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="Amit Singh"  target="_blank">Amit Singh</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/KingSidharth" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/KingSidharth', 'King Sidharth']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="King Sidharth"  target="_blank">King Sidharth</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/aniket.pant" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/aniket.pant', 'Aniket Pant']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="Aniket Pant"  target="_blank">Aniket Pant</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/puneetsahalot" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/puneetsahalot', 'Puneet Sahalot']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="Puneet Sahalot"  target="_blank">Puneet Sahalot</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"> and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jaydipparikh" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/jaydipparikh', 'Jaydip Parikh']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="Jaydip Parikh"  target="_blank">Jaydip Parikh</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">. Devil&#8217;s Workshop had </span><a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="Interview with Gaurav Singh" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/analysis/interview-organiser-wordcamp-jabalpur-2011-gaurav-baghel/47719/" target="_blank">interviewed Gaurav Singh</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">, post the WordCamp.</span>

If you compare the sessions and the speakers, WordCamp Jabalpur was a definite progression on WordCamp Delhi. The topics were more advanced and varied, the speakers differed in professions and the range of talks was wider. I wasn&#8217;t there for even this one (I had just begun freelancing). However, my friend and colleague, Rakshit Thakker attended as a speaker. This was a good event, but the community was still struggling to find its baby steps.

<span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.7143em; line-height: 1.25em;">WordCamp Cuttack ’12</span>

**<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74877" alt="cuttack" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/cuttack.png" width="218" height="218" />Update:*** This wasn&#8217;t there in the original article.Amit [brought it to my notice][1] in the comments. The text below is almost verbatim.*

This WordCamp was smaller in scale than the others. Held over just a day, it was organised by Soumya Pratihari. In first half there were user focused talks. The last two hours were focused on a workshop for creating plugins. This ended up being a two hour long discussion on WordPress development, plugins, themes, security and how to troubleshoot issues.

Compared to all other WordCamps in India, turnout was lesser. However, this resulted in better interaction between attendees and speakers.

## WordCamp Mumbai &#8217;12

<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74154" alt="wcmumbai" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/wcmumbai.png" width="218" height="218" />Organised by a group of students, in the financial capital of India, </span><a href="http://2012.mumbai.wordcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://2012.mumbai.wordcamp.org/', 'this WordCamp']);" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" title="WordCamp Mumbai"  target="_blank">this WordCamp</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"> courted some disasters. A couple of speakers were sponsors who talked about irrelevant stuff. A sponsor spoke in detail about the intricacies of off-page SEO and pay-per-click advertising to WordPress </span><em style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">developers</em><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">.</span>

It was a sound meetup for marketing, developing Android apps, Windows 8, apart from a few important things about Google. Primarily, it was about the business of search engine optimisation and marketing on social networks. Except for a couple of talks, the event didn&#8217;t add any value to the community.

Attendees (including, yours truly) who felt let down, registered their protest, but were ignored for a decent amount of time. Eventually, apologies were issued.

The organisers had in fact, done a huge service to the community. Observing the fiasco in the background were two <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">people who  </span><span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">understood that WordCamp Mumbai was a lesson in &#8216;How not to organise a WordCamp&#8217;.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.7143em; line-height: 1.25em;">WordCamp Baroda &#8217;13</span>

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74155" alt="wcbaroda" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/wcbaroda.png" width="218" height="218" />One of the two people I indicated above is Rahul Banker, a young professional blogger from Baroda. Picking up the thread from Jabalpur and passing over Mumbai, he organised a <a href="http://2013.baroda.wordcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://2013.baroda.wordcamp.org/', 'WordCamp in Baroda']);" title="WordCamp Baroda"  target="_blank">WordCamp in Baroda</a>.

This WordCamp had a higher relevance to WordPress and excellent speakers presented some complex topics in simple, easy to understand details. Being held in Gujarat, the hotbed of SEO/Social Media and other forms of digital marketing, the marketing influence was there but not at the cost of relevance.

Attention was paid to minute details like numerous charging points everywhere, fast and reliable internet connections, etc. Everything was well orchestrated and the event was held without any hiccups. This was a prime example of event management.

Also, there were ample occasions for attendees and speakers to mingle informally and discuss things: the true aim of a community event. In the backdrop of Mumbai, WordCamp Baroda was a greater success and according to the regulars, the best WordCamp they had attended till then.

There is a <a title="WordCamps in India" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/analysis/wordcamps-india-tdis/71081/" target="_blank">post on Devil&#8217;s Workshop</a> that pretty much sums up the mood, post WordCamp Baroda.

## WordCamp Pune &#8217;13

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74156" alt="wcpune" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/wcpune.png" width="218" height="218" />The second person who was quietly taking notes and preparing his own event was Amit Singh. With a bare minimum of sponsors (compared to Baroda and especially Mumbai), his team, according to a lot of people who attended the event, delivered<a href="http://2013.pune.wordcamp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://2013.pune.wordcamp.org/', ' India&#8217;s best WordCamp yet']);" title="WordCamp Pune"  target="_blank"> India&#8217;s best WordCamp yet</a>.

The event wasn&#8217;t as fluid as Baroda was. It lacked a bit in event management. However, that is excusable in favour of its content, enthusiasm and a genuine interest in the actual reason for a WordCamp. This one had something for everyone. From absolute novices to experts, there were more than one session that were useful. Bloggers, developers, marketers and entrepreneurs, all benefited from the event and were all praises.

This WordCamp was also unique for the Workshops that were conducted. These ran parallel to the speaker sessions. Workshops were practical training sessions on using WordPress. They were meant for the benefit of students and novices, and were well received.

Another factor that went in favour of WordCamp Pune was that by then, there were some veterans of previous WordCamps. They were great mentors to the newbies. Questions flew thick and answers were aplenty. Doubts were raised and solved. People disagreed and fought. People agreed to each other too. It was a warm and exciting event.

Speakers were more interactive, drawing more participation from the listeners. In all, a proper community buzz had begun shaping up.

## The scenario now

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74157" alt="wphub.in" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/wphub.in_.png" width="218" height="218" />Post WordCamp Pune, there is a definite community that interacts regularly on various online platforms. A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wphub.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/wphub.in', 'facebook page']);" title="WPHub on Facebook"  target="_blank">facebook page</a> and a site from an initiative called <a href="http://wphub.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wphub.in', 'WPHub']);" title="WPHub"  target="_blank">WPHub</a> have sprung up to coordinate and boost the growth of the WordPress community in India.

Meetups have started happening more often. More Indian organisations are building products around WordPress. Still, the only time the community truly comes together is in a WordCamp. By far, the only yardstick that I could find to measure the growth and evolution, is a WordCamp. Although, more WordCamps are being planned, until the next one actually happens, it&#8217;d be too early to pass a judgement on the maturity of the community.

&nbsp;

## A hope for the future

The next WordCamp can only be better than the last. Everyone has higher expectations. People have tasted the benefits of community behaviour. More people who will share knowledge will be discovered. More people will hop on to the ride.

It is guaranteed — the shift is only progressive!
