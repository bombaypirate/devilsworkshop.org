Today is a great day for Apple fans around the globe, not just because of Apple&#8217;s media event, but because of the fact that Apple is livestreaming it. They don&#8217;t normally do this, except for WWDC and other special events.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-78303" alt="col" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/10/col-600x339.jpg" width="600" height="339" />][1]

As most of you already know, Apple will be updating its iPad lineup (both full-sized and Mini), MacBook Pros, Mac Pro and OS X Mavericks.

I&#8217;m personally looking forward to OS X Mavericks (the price and final list of features will be announced today). But you apparently know what you&#8217;re most excited about.

The event is going to start in a few hours from now. Here&#8217;s a list of timings to help you figure out the time for your zone.

13:00 — New York, New York  
10:00 — San Francisco, California  
04:00 — Sydney, Australia (Oct. 23)  
02:00 — Tokyo, Japan (Oct. 23)  
01:00 — Shanghai, China (Oct. 23)  
22:30 — New Delhi, India  
21:00 — Moscow, Russia  
19:00 — Rome, Italy  
18:00 — London, England

Apple has even updated its homepage with a gigantic image notifying fans about the event.

The event will be streamed live, from Apple&#8217;s site, and it requires Safari on OS X, iOS 4.2 or later. Streaming via Apple TV requires second or third-generation Apple TV with software 5.0.2 or later.
