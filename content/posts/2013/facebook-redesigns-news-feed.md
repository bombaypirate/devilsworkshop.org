Facebook had [announced earlier that they were about to redesign the &#8216;New feed&#8217;][1] on its website. Facebook has announced a new &#8216;news feed&#8217; experience on web, iPhone/iPad and Android platforms. The new design is touted as a clutter free experience. The focus now is more on having icons and also larger images and clarity of the feed.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-72088 aligncenter" alt="Facebook_News_Layout" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/03/Facebook_News_Layout-600x317.png" width="600" height="317" />][2]I have not yet got this new design activated for my Facebook account but looking at the screenshots, I think Facebook&#8217;s feed seem to be liberally inspired by Google+. Especially how Google+ shows up feeds on mobile and tablet platforms.

The iPhone/iPad and Android update will be released over the next few days/week *(Facebook can be notoriously quick or slow with changes) *but you need to get onto a **wait list** for the new design.

Just visit the following link ***<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/newsfeed" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/about/newsfeed', 'https://www.facebook.com/about/newsfeed']);" >https://www.facebook.com/about/newsfeed</a>* **and click on **Join Waiting List **button.

It will be interesting to see the subtle differences how Facebook shows Sponsored updates and advertisements. Hopefully it will be more relevant and less spammy than it is at the moment.
