More and more leaks happen as we get closer to the release of Nexus 5. In fact, it&#8217;s probably the most leaked Nexus ever. This time, it&#8217;s funny &#8211; because, Google itself (deliberate may be?) has put Nexus 5 on the Play Store.

The Nexus 5 was listed beside the new Nexus 7 and 10 in the devices section of Google Play. This includes a high resolution photo of Nexus 5 (as shown below), along with product description. It was of course pulled off after a few minutes.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-78239" alt="Nexus 5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/10/nex-600x569.png" width="600" height="569" />][1]

The product description says &#8220;Capture the everyday and the epic in new fresh ways. Starting at 349$&#8221;. That apparently gives a hint at Nexus 5&#8217;s camera improvements, along with the price tag of 349$ for the 16GB model.

You can also make out from the picture that, Hangouts has replaced Messaging app and there are little UI tweaks (transparent nav/status bar) here and there, in Kitkat. All this is of course leaked a few days back, this is just more of a confirmation.

We&#8217;re not sure when is the launch day of Kitkat/Nexus 5, but nevertheless, this is an exciting time for Android fans.

Do you look forward to get the Nexus 5? Do comment below.
