Last week [Amazon made its foray into India][1]. I being someone who loves to read books was interested in the Kindle tablets and their official entry into India. Today, <a href="http://amazon.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://amazon.in', 'Amazon.in']);" >Amazon.in</a> lists 5 Kindle tablets available.

The two premium tablets are the Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire HD 8.9. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#8243; is priced at **Rs. 21,999**. The device has 16GB storage, WiFi connectivity, The Kindle Fire HD is priced at Rs. 15,999. This device is different from the previous one in the sense it has a smaller screen size.

The other versions inclide Kindle Paperwhite 3G at **Rs. 13,999**, the Kindle Paperwhite at **Rs. 10,999** and finally Kindle (basic) at **Rs. 5,999**.

Apart from the Kindle devices, Amazon India is also rolling out the e-books that can be read on Kindle devices. The Kindle store is pretty good as it also has <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kindle/id302584613?mt=8', 'iPad apps']);" >iPad apps</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle', 'Android apps']);" >Android apps</a> to help you read your Kindle books on other platforms. This means if you buy e-books on Kindle you can read them on your iPad or Android tablets too.

I think with Kindle store in India, Amazon joins Flipkart as the only online stores that are selling e-books in India. [Flipkart&#8217;s Flyte store though is being closed but that affects only the MP3 store][2]. They will continue selling e-books.
