There are times when we happen to lose our most mobile phones. After a moment of shock, frantic searching follows. But for those with Androids, SMSAlarm is here to help.

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nebkat.smsalarm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nebkat.smsalarm', 'SMSAlarm']);" >SMSAlarm</a> is a simple app that alerts you with a sound when your Android is lost. The app requires you to send a custom SMS from any other mobile phone, and your mobile phone will start shrilling with an alarm noise. You can set the alarm duration too. The maximum duration is 2 minutes.

Once installed, you can set the custom SMS by choosing the *Activation SMS* option in the app. You can also choose to set your device to *Vibrate* when that custom SMS is received. You can alarm test the alarm sound with the *Test* option in that app.

The best thing about this app is set, the app works even if your phone is in the *Silent* mode. The app is of no use if your phone&#8217;s battery is dead.
