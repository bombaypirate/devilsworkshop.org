Until today, Google Now was only available one Android but today it goes live on iOS. If you are using Google Search app on your iPhone or iPad, you only have to update the app. The Google Now feature will be updated onto your Google Search app.

Google Now basically taps into your data from various services like Gmail, Google Maps, Google+, Google Places, your search history and more. This information is then used to serve you with useful reminders and prompts.You might need change your privacy settings to allow your iPhone or iPad to let the Google app access your location data.

This is indicative that Google Now might soon be coming to our desktops thanks to it being [integrated with Chrome or even Google&#8217;s homepage][1]. We might see more such updates from Google in the [run-up to its annual Google I/O conference][2].

If you have an iPhone or a iPad try out Google Now on it and drop in your comments.
