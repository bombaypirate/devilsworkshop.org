If you own a Macbook or iPad from Apple, chances are you might be using a popular feed reader app called Reeder. The Reeder app was available for the price of $4.99 previously but now has dropped the price to &#8216;zero&#8217;. So now Reeder is available free for iPad and Mac users. The iPhone users are not so lucky, the app remain a paid one for the phone.

The app will probably not remain free for a long time. It will remain free until Reeder releases a version 2.0 for iPad and Mac users.The new version will also be a time when it moves away from its dependence on Google Reader.

## Reeder&#8217;s move away from Google Reader

  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Though Reeder app has a healthy community, its future is a bit unclear. This is because it was totally dependent on Google Reader. But Reeder insists they will continue beyond 1st July, 2013 the date when Google Reader goes offline.</span>
  * Reeder will be also experimenting with a standalone local RSS Feed reader.
  * The iPhone app will also integrate with FeedBin a RSS feed reader which is a paid service.

So if you own a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id439845554?mt=12&ls=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id439845554?mt=12&ls=1', 'Mac']);" >Mac</a> and/or an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id375661689?mt=8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id375661689?mt=8', 'iPad']);" >iPad</a>, then it will be a good idea to check out Reeder app. You can also look up other Google Reader alternatives.
