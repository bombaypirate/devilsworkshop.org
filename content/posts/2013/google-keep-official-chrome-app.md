Google Keep is a service that is the Evernote clone from Google. It is baked into Google Drive and that allows syncing notes between web, phone and tablets. Today, Google has released a Chrome app for Google Keep. The app basically opens a small window that allows you to edit and read your notes that you have on Google Keep.

### Google Keep Chrome App features

  * Install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki', 'Chrome app']);" >Chrome app</a> and it shows up with the Google Keep icon on your Chrome&#8217;s new page layout.
  * The app opens a small window that can be kept open through the day while we can add new notes and task lists.
  * All the notes automatically sync with Google Keep app for Android.
  * There are still some downsides of using Google Keep on Chrome. I would have preferred a right-click option to open the window. An extension instead of an app would have been better.

### Is Google Keep useful?

I have started using Google Keep more than my favourite task manager called Any.do. But unfortunately Google Keep has only a Android app but nothing available for iPhone or iPad devices. But considering [Google I/O conference][1] takes place in a couple of week, a lot of new announcements on updates will be expected.

Do try out Google Keep on Chrome and drop in your comments.
