This had to happen and many people have seen this coming. Microsoft is finally trying to address many of users&#8217; common annoyances with a small update to its OS, Windows 8.

Windows 8 had got a lot of criticism that it&#8217;s much harder to use than the previous versions and that the change is too drastic. All that is indeed true. Apparently, it&#8217;s impossible for Microsoft to completely take a U-turn and get back to Windows 7. So, now they&#8217;re trying to appease users by making it a little less confusing.

Here&#8217;s the new stuff Microsoft&#8217;s releasing with Windows 8.1.

### Bring that Start button back

[ Personally, I never really cared about the lack of Start button][2] in Windows 8. Though, that&#8217;s not the case with most mainstream users. So with 8.1, MSFT is bringing the Start button back. Yes, for real. But only the button. Nothing more.

If you hit the button, you&#8217;ll be taken back to the Start screen. Something is better than nothing, right?

Also, for all you Start screen haters, Microsoft has added a nice new feature to 8.1 and that&#8217;s boot to desktop. It will be off by default, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be many users who will search for it and switch it on.

### Do more inside Metro

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74881" alt="App snapping in Windows 8.1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/snap-600x337.png" width="600" height="337" />][3]

How much ever Microsoft tries to push Metro apps over desktop apps, it&#8217;s not going to change the fact that Metro apps suck. All stock Metro apps in Windows 8 are going to get updated, that includes Maps, Photos, Mail and etc.

Also, you can do a lot more customisation using Settings app itself, instead of relying on Control Panel. Again, it&#8217;s just Microsoft pushing Metro apps.

App snapping has improved too. If you have a multi monitor setup, you can now snap 3 Metro apps. You can also snap windows of the same app. Think of viewing two websites loaded side by side in two Metro IE windows.

Apart from these, there are small improvements like you can now search Bing through the Search feature in Charms bar. Windows Store, [the ghost town][4], is updated with a better UI and more information and charts related to apps.

It seems like the update will be free for existing Windows 8 users and will probably made available in the Windows Store itself. (think OS X Mountain Lion)

Can these improvements make Windows 8 less irritating for you? Put that in the comments.
