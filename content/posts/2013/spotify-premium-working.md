Music streaming services like Spotify and Rdio are pretty awesome, but there&#8217;s an annoying thing about them &#8211; they aren&#8217;t available in most non-US countries.

If you&#8217;re in a country like India, where Spotify isn&#8217;t yet available, here&#8217;s a trick to get it working. Getting Spotify Free to work is easy, as all you need is a US proxy, but here we&#8217;ll see Spotify Premium.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-79058" alt="Spotify Premium" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-21-at-7.30.15-pm-600x388.png" width="600" height="388" />][1]

Spotify Premium is a paid subscription plan of Spotify with which you&#8217;ll get unlimited access to music, on both mobile and desktop.

The problem here is, Spotify accepts credit cards only of the country you have signed up under. In this case, it&#8217;s US. And it&#8217;s obviously hard to get a US credit card.

The trick here is to use Entropay card for payments. It works because Spotify has recently released in Malta &#8211; that&#8217;s the country Entropay is based off.

So here&#8217;s the process.

  1. Go to <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.tunnelbear.com/', 'Tunnelbear']);" >Tunnelbear</a> and download the software. It&#8217;s a VPN service for accessing US/UK-only websites.
  2. Turn on Tunnelbear and choose US as country. It&#8217;ll take a few seconds to connect.
  3. Now go to <a href="http://spotify.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://spotify.com', 'Spotify']);" >Spotify</a> and create a new account. Then <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/download" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.spotify.com/us/download', 'download apps']);" >download apps</a> for your platform.
  4. Now go to <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/subscription/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.spotify.com/us/account/subscription/', 'Subscription page']);" >Subscription page</a> and add a new payment method.
  5. Now add your Entropay card as a new payment method and your country will be changed to Malta automatically. If you don&#8217;t have an Entropay card, <a href="https://www.entropay.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.entropay.com/', 'create one']);" >create one</a>.
  6. You can now try out the 30-day <a href="https://www.spotify.com/int/freetrial/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.spotify.com/int/freetrial/', 'Spotify Premium trial']);" >Spotify Premium trial</a>. As the trial gets expired, your Entropay card will **automatically** be charged for subscription.

That&#8217;s all! With Spotify Premium you can listen to unlimited number of songs on desktop/mobile and even have them for offline listening. All this without a VPN or proxy.

If you couldn&#8217;t get the trick working, just leave out a comment. We&#8217;ll help you out.
