Most of the smartphone apps these days ask for special permissions like accessing your contacts, sending texts on their own, using your Gallery photos and more. To be on the safe side, we must be aware of the things that these apps ask and should take steps to be safe. If any app is found to be leaking out your contact numbers to third parties or sending your private data to others, that app should be removed immediately.

To take of care of your privacy, here comes Clueful. If you are an Apple fanboy or a previous iOS user, you might recognize this app. It is an app brought by Bitdefender. Available earlier to the iOS users, Clueful is new to Android. The app is easy to use and gives you a detailed analysis on the list of apps installed in your Android.

## How Clueful Works

  1. <span style="line-height: 14px;">On opening Clueful, the app scans all the apps installed on your Android and compares with it&#8217;s Cloud database from Bitdefender. Note that the app requires Internet connectivity to work.</span>
  2. Once done, it classifies them as low, moderate and high risk apps.
  3. It also gives you aÂ *Privacy Score*. The larger the score, the safer you are.
