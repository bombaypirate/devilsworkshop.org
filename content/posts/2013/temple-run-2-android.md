Just last week, Temple Run 2 &#8211; sequel of one of the most popular mobile games ever <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/temple-run-2/id572395608?mt=8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/temple-run-2/id572395608?mt=8', 'has released for iPhone']);" >has released for iPhone</a>. Today, it has been released for Android.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-70897" alt="temple-run-2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/01/Screenshot_2013-01-24-17-50-04-337x600.png" width="337" height="600" />][1]

So what does Temple Run 2 bring to the table? Well, quite a lot. They&#8217;ve revamped the game scenery which looks much more organic now and it constantly keeps changing. You don&#8217;t just run, instead you&#8217;ll be swinging on ropes, riding mine carts and lot more.

And of course, you&#8217;ll be chased by a monstrous monkey.

There are new obstacles, power ups and characters (the default is still Guy Dangerous).

The game went pretty smoothly on my phone, just like the original Temple Run.

While Apps releasing for iPhone first and then getting ported to Android isn&#8217;t something new, it&#8217;s good that Imangi Studios got the game to &#8216;droid in a week.

The worst situation is of Windows Phone users, who don&#8217;t have a chance to play even the original Temple Run.

It&#8217;s now available on the Play store for free. Just use the link below, as it isn&#8217;t yet available through search. Try it out and tell us what you think about it.
