Google is working on a new note taking feature that will be part of Google Drive. This new feature will allows users to store notes or to-do lists and sync and probably sync them on Chrome and Android. Google had a service called Notebook. It was used to store notes much like Evernote and other similar apps. Notebook never took off and it was [finally shutdown along with other Google products][1].

Today, a new feature called &#8220;Keep&#8221; seemed to have been leaked. It lasted long enough for <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/03/17/google-keep-is-live-google-launches-a-note-taking-service/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/03/17/google-keep-is-live-google-launches-a-note-taking-service/', 'Android Police']);" >Android Police</a> to get some screenshots.

If you visit ***<a href="http://G.co/Keep" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://G.co/Keep', 'http://G.co/Keep']);" >http://G.co/Keep</a>***** **it redirects us to an unavailable app on Google Play. Going by the screenshot image above, it looks like users will be able to store short notes, lists and images.*

We will post a complete review of the app when its officially released by Google.
