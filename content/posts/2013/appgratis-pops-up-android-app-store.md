If there is one problem which is common among all major mobile operating systems, that&#8217;s app discovery. Apple&#8217;s App Store is relatively better than Play Store and even the Windows Marketplace, but they&#8217;re almost on the same floor.

AppGratis was one of those companies which tried to solve this problem with their service. For starters, AppGratis shows off a good paid app everyday, which is free for limited time. It was very popular on iOS, but a few months ago, it got pulled off from the App Store as they violated few of its policies. After a lot of drama took place, AppGratis wrote a blog post <a href="http://appgratis.com/blog/2013/04/18/setting-things-straight-about-the-appgratis-business-model/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://appgratis.com/blog/2013/04/18/setting-things-straight-about-the-appgratis-business-model/', 'officially clearing a lot of confusion']);" >officially clearing a lot of confusion</a>Â among users.

They even have started a petition a month back, which got tremendous response from users. Nevertheless, there&#8217;s no signs of Apple bringing back AppGratis to the App Store.

Interestingly, they released their app for Android, a few days back &#8211; and it&#8217;s pretty good.

While there isn&#8217;t anything special about the app on Android, it works. They have posted around 15 app deals, i.e. apps which are free for limited time (a single day, or sometimes even more). Just like the iOS app, you can set AppGratis on Android to notify you every day with an app deal.

All AppGratis recommendations are picked by humans &#8211; they are essentially tested and hand picked by their team. This is one of the reasons for why AppGratis is so popular. Though, from what I&#8217;ve tried, their Android app recommendations aren&#8217;t up to the mark. The apps didn&#8217;t seem to be of high quality, but I&#8217;m sure the recommendations will get better with time.

It&#8217;s available on the Play store, so go grab it.
