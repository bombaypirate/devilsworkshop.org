You might want your phone to go on vibrate mode or shutdown at a particular time every day. You might want to switch off your WIFI on the phone when you are in office. Such tasks on Android can be automated with app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=AutomateIt.mainPackage&hl=en" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=AutomateIt.mainPackage&hl=en', 'Automate It']);" >Automate It</a>.

### Features of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=AutomateIt.mainPackage&hl=en" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=AutomateIt.mainPackage&hl=en', 'Automate It']);" >Automate It</a>

  * The app is loaded with 6 default rules which can be customized.
  * New rules can be either created or searched from &#8220;Rules Market&#8221;.
  * One feature I liked in this app is the experimental Activity Recognition. If you set the trigger to switch off your WIFI in a car or switch it to silent or vibrate mode when you reach your office or college, it does happen but it definitely needs improvement as this fails to trigger sometimes.
  * Some stuff you can do with this app are set it up to send an automatic SMS on a specific day and time.

This works very well with the usual basic triggers and I have not been having any problems. The last thing to keep in mind is that there are two triggers that could drain your battery if not used properly &#8211; location and sensor triggers. Overall, this app is worth the download.
