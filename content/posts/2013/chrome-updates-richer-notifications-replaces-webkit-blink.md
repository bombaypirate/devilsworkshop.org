Chrome has released an update for Linux and Windows users. The update version, will include two major changes. First is the [planned move away from WebKit onto Blink][1]. Blink is a forked version WebKit that is being implemented by Google. The second update is richer notifications on Chrome.Â [Notifications were first implemented on Gmail][2], where users could get a pop-up displaying who has sent a new email to them.<figure id="attachment_76481" style="width: 440px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The new update will show richer notifications which are more interactive and descriptive as seen in the image below.

### Configure Notifications on Chrome

  * The browser should update automatically on your Windows or Linux platform. The update is also available on <a href="http://google.com/chrome" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com/chrome', 'Google.com/chrome']);" >Google.com/chrome</a>.
  * The Richer notifications on Chrome will include many services and will show up with an icon on the system tray. if you have disabled notifications on Chrome, you can switch them on by entering **Chrome://Settings** in the address bar and then under **&#8220;Privacy&#8221;** click on **&#8220;Content Settings&#8221;**. In **&#8220;Content Settings&#8221;** users can look up &#8220;**Notifications**&#8221; options and also edit exceptions which are created by Google Apps.
  * When a notifications pops up, we can review the settings.

At the moment, I do not expect a lot of apps to have implemented &#8220;Richer Notifications&#8221; on Chrome, but developers will surely roll more out in time. This at the moment works on Chrome OS, Linux and Windows. The update for Mac will be released later.

### Google Now on Chrome

This roll out of &#8216;Richer Notifications&#8217; in Chrome, indicates the eventual plan to bring about Google Now on Chrome. Google Now currently on Android uses data like browsing history, maps, calendar details and email to push notifications on the phone called Google Now. The notifications are usually very intelligent, for example it calculates the amount of traffic on the road and tells you to leave for a meeting early based on that data.

The real big integration will be to have integration of Chrome and Android notifications at some point of time.

Do update your Chrome browser and let us know what you think about &#8220;Richer Notifications&#8221;.
