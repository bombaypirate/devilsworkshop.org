Google released Android 4.4 KitKat and the new Nexus 5 phone a couple of days ago. The Nexus 5 is already available in the US and other markets but its availability is not officially confirmed in India.

What is officially confirmed is the the price of the Nexus 5 phone in India. Just head over to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Nexus_5_16GB_Black?id=nexus_5_black_16gb" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Nexus_5_16GB_Black?id=nexus_5_black_16gb', 'Nexus 5 playstore listing']);" >Nexus 5 playstore listing</a> and it shows the prices of both the 16GB and 32 GB variants.

The Nexus 5 16 GB variant is priced at **Rs. 28,999** and the 32 GB variant at **Rs. 32,999**.

That is about Rs. 3000 more than what Nexus 4 was priced in India. According to <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/hardware/Google-India-to-launch-second-generation-Nexus-7-on-November-12/articleshow/25123669.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/hardware/Google-India-to-launch-second-generation-Nexus-7-on-November-12/articleshow/25123669.cms', 'TOI']);" >TOI</a> the release date for Nexus 5 in India will be the 14th November.

The Nexus 7 (2013) version is also expected in India soon and hopefully that too will be available on November 14th. Google&#8217;s ambiguity over the release of Android 4.4 and Nexus 5 has been so much that it is difficult to take any rumours on a release date seriously.

**About Android 4.4**: I guess Google still has to learn a bit from Apple who release an update on the same day to millions of devices. My phone (Nexus 4) still does not have the Android 4.4 update available officially, which is a same as most Nexus owners buy the device to get the latest Android version. I will post a details Android 4.4 review once I get my hands on it.
