The <a href="https://plus.google.com/+kitkat/posts" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/+kitkat/posts', 'official KitKat']);" title="KitKat on Google+">official KitKat</a> page on Google+ has posted an [Android robot in KitKat][1] style, with a description &#8220;*Everybody dance now!*&#8221;

Google is known to tease users with interesting riddles from time to time. So what is special about this coded message?

If you happen to be a fan of the 90&#8217;s music, you might recognize that &#8220;*Everybody dance now*&#8221; is a popular line from a hit single by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C+C_Music_Factory" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C+C_Music_Factory', 'C+C Music Factory']);" title="C+C Music Factory">C+C Music Factory</a>. The song was released on October 18, 1990.

To make things more interesting, the song happens to be exactly 4 minutes and 4 seconds long, another coded references to Android KitKat version being 4.4.

So the final conclusion is that Google might be launching Android KitKat on October 18. Just in time before they introduce a new Nexus phone, often called Nexus 5.
