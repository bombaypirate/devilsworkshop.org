We knew Google was prepping something to serve up Nexus products in India. This was done with India being listed on the Nexus page. The Nexus 7 tablet was available in some India retail outlets but it was more or less a limited launch. Today, Google has <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb', 'listed Nexus 7 on Google Play store']);" >listed Nexus 7 on Google Play store</a> for India.

This means users can now order a Nexus 7 tablet from Google Play directly.

The Nexus 7 listed in India is not exactly the latest version. It the WIFI only version with 16GB storage space. It will have Android 4.1 running on it but I guess it can be upgraded online once you buy it.

### Should we buy Android tablets?

After buying an iPad Mini, I am not very keen on buying an Android tablet. I still think Android as an OS is miles ahead of Apple&#8217;s iOS from a user perspective. But the app ecosystem for tablets specifically is still a lot superior on app store rather than Google Play. But with more tablets being sold, I am sure Android app will catch up fast. Also Android based tablets tend to be a lot cheaper.
