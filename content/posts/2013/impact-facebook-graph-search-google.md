Facebook has recently announced a new trick. It goes by the name &#8220;***Graph Search***&#8220;. I have signed up like many people might have, but I have not seen it showing up on my account as yet. From what some are saying it will might take up to &#8220;weeks&#8221;. I was intrigued to by [Search Graph and the screenshots shared in a post by Sauravji][1]t, but I was taken aback by the deluge of posts on how Facebook&#8217;s Graph Search will challenge Google&#8217;s search dominance.

Facebook has apparently found a way to crash Google&#8217;s party.<figure id="attachment_70584" style="width: 540px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

So will Facebook disrupt Google&#8217;s search business in a big way?

### Yes! Google will worry!

Okay, Google is a search giant and it has massive resources. Billions of search queries are handled by Google without breaking a sweat. Why would Google worry about Facebook&#8217;s improved search feature.

  * <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The money is in local advertising. Google shows up pretty good </span>localized<span data-mce-mark="1"> results. I usually search for restaurants, hotels and even for movies on Google. Google rules this niche and makes potentially billions from local businesses investing in AdWords.</span></span>
  * <span data-mce-mark="1">Facebook has a lot of data that is personal. It knows the movies people watch, the theaters people go to and their experience visiting restaurants. Facebook&#8217;s Graph search would be very useful to find information that is personalized.</span>
  * <span data-mce-mark="1">Google might worry about this. As a matter of fact they have been worrying about it for years now. That is why they ended up creating their own social network Google+. They want similar personalized data to work with and augment their search results.</span>

### Maybe its just Facebook fixing itself

Searching on Facebook is a terrible experience  It auto-prompts me people, pages and more but most of them are not what I am searching for. It is decent if you are searching for the profile of your friends but for searching for new stuff, it is pretty much useless.

  * So with Graph Search, Facebook might not be really be thinking of hurting Google but is actually fixing a really under-utilized feature.
  * Facebook it just rolling out something new for browser. There is still no clarity on how Graph Search will work on mobile phones.
  * Also more than hurting Google&#8217;s search engine, a great search feature will hurt LinkedIn. I can already see HR departments all over the world, looking up various permutations and combinations for finding good potential employees on Facebook instead of LinkedIn.

### Let&#8217;s not get over excited! It is Facebook

Facebook has a great track record of coming out with something interesting and then making a mess of it. It messed up the [Timeline redesign][3].

  * <span data-mce-mark="1">Simple things like a photo will not be displayed in completely in the profile layout. On the whole I still find the timeline design very clunky.</span>
  * <span data-mce-mark="1">It also has some major problems managing my lists. I</span><span data-mce-mark="1"> cannot move people in bulk from one list to another (like we can on Google+)</span><span data-mce-mark="1">.</span>
  * <span data-mce-mark="1">And hopefully we won&#8217;t see Graph Search being case of </span><span data-mce-mark="1">Facebook stumbling on the &#8220;Privacy&#8221; front.</span>

Overall it is a good development as something critical like &#8220;Search&#8221; for Facebook will be fixed. But only time will tell if Facebook will be able to really deliver a great product let alone challenge the likes of Google at the search engine game. That game is something Google really knows how to play very well.
