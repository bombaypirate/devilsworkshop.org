The next version of Android is not going to be called Key Lime Pie. It will be called KitKat after the popular chocolate brand owned by Nestle. The first indications was this photo (below) by Android chief Sundar Pichai in a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SundarPichai/posts/NeBW7AjT1QM" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SundarPichai/posts/NeBW7AjT1QM', 'Google+ post']);" >Google+ post</a>.

Nestle and Google have reached an understanding where Google is allowed to use the trademark KitKat. It&#8217;s an understanding but not a deal because Nestle claims that no money changed hands. But that does not stop both brands to enjoying a lot of sustained publicity.

Google and Nestle came to an understanding back in February during the Mobile World Congress according to the Verge. Google also announced that Android phone have crossed one billion activations.

### Android will tap into Nestle&#8217;s network

[<img class="alignright  wp-image-77514" title="KitKat Network" alt="KitKat Network" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/09/KitKat-Network.png" width="225" height="220" />][2]Every Android phone which will run on Android 4.4 will feature the trademark KitKat.Â KitKat will sell 50 million chocolate bars in 19 countries featuring Android branding. This will include the options of buying Nexus 7 tablets and also getting free gift cards for the Google Play store.

KitKat will also gain a lot of free advertisement with its brand name being ubiquitous with an OS which will feature on millions of phones and tablets.

### When is Android 4.4 KitKat expected?

Firstly, Android has confirmed that the next version will be 4.4 and not 5.0. This is what is being called KitKat. The new OS version will be released over the next couple of months. It is no surprise that a launch of Nexus 5 phone is around the corner. A Nexus device has almost always introduced a major Android update.

Hopefully in a few days the hype around the chocolate name will subside and we will get more details on the actual features of the operating system.
