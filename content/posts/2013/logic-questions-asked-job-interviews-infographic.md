If you have been to a few job interviews there are some specific questions that you might have come across more than once. Personally for me one of the most asked questions were &#8220;Where do your see yourself in 5 years?&#8221; and &#8220;Why do you want to work with our company?&#8221;.

While many cover what the ideal answer should be for such questions, there is actually a logic behind asking such questions at an interview. The logic or the hidden reasons are really not to see if you know the answer to a Â question but to get a candidate reveal more about themselves.

If you are attending job interviews then it might be a good idea to go over the logic behind these questions to answer more appropriately at your next interview.
