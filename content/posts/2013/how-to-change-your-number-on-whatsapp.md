Your WhatsApp account has always been linked to your mobile number. But, with the latest update(s) on WhatsApp for all platforms, Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Nokia S40 and BlackBerry 10, you can now change your mobile number &#8211; that&#8217;s porting your WhatsApp account to another number.

This new option *Change number* is available inside the *Account settings* tab &#8211; **Settings > Account > Change number**. The operation is really simple. Just enter your old mobile number and the new mobile number in that page, and WhatsApp will do the rest for you. This will move your account info, settings and groups to your new number.

For those using Nokia S40, go to **Options > Settings > Change phone number**.

Sadly there isn&#8217;t an option for you to change number on Nokia Symbian and Windows Phone yet.

## Things to note

Make sure that you have both your old mobile SIM and the new one plugged into different mobile phones. WhatsApp needs your new number to be active on a mobile device at the time of changing numbers.

## Why this feature?

Most people always go about jumping from one carrier to the other. It is tiresome to take WhatsApp backups, import to the new mobile phone and then restore, isn&#8217;t it?

Also, this feature is makes it easy for premium WhatsApp users to continue their membership hassle-free.
