Packed with a Quad Core processor, the Micromax Canvas HD A116 smartphone is a real smasher in the Micromax arsenal. This Android Jelly Bean powered A116 smartphone comes with great features. The phone has a 1.2 GHz Quad Core Processor, 1 GB RAM, 5 inch screen and runs on Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. These are surprising features for a phone that is priced only at Rs 14,000 ($260).<figure id="attachment_71601" style="width: 307px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### Canvas HD A116 Specs and Features

  * <strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"></strong><span style="line-height: 14px;">The phone packs a 1.2 GHz Quad Core Processor.</span>
  * Supported networks are 2G/3G, WiFi enabled, Bluetooth 4.0. It also supports dual SIM.
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The screen is a 5-inch IPS screen which is multi-touch enabled. The screen resolution is 720 X 1280 pixels.</span>
  * Primary Camera is 8 MP with LED flash and secondary one being 2 MP.
  * Internal memory is 1.77 GB with 1 GB RAM. Thankfully it is expandable upto 32 GB.

The disappointing part of this phone is that it does not have a Gorilla glass which I think is a must for touch devices. Also its performance on how well it will handle the powerful Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean version is still unclear.

The real attractive feature of this phone is its price at Rs. 14,000 ($260). The phone will literally cost half of what most other high-end phones with similar features will cost. But this is not exactly a replacement for a high-end smartphone device either.
