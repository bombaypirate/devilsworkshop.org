Are you a blogger or a Facebook Page owner? Then the most trending thing these days on Facebook for you must be Facebook ads and sponsored posts. Lots of websites, bloggers and bigger brands are promoting their products using Facebook ads. It&#8217;s a good way to interact with customers of similar interest.

As expected the rolling in to this ad program is easy but it&#8217;s difficult to opt out. The only reason why I am saying this is that they will store your Credit Card Details and you cannot delete it without providing details of another payment method. Even if you don&#8217;t have any active ads there but there&#8217;s always a risk that they might charge you for your ads if you click something mistakenly or you have selected &#8220;promote my latest post&#8221; while creating an ad campaign.

To avoid this you have following two options in which you don&#8217;t need to enter another payment option:

### 1. Closing your ads account completely:

First option that you have is to close your Facebook ad account. This will suspend your Facebook Ad account and indirectly all your payment options associated with it will be deleted. To do this, click on the *Gear *icon on the header of your Facebook page and select &#8220;Manage Ads&#8221; from the list.

Just confirm your suspension after that and you account will be closed. This will also delete all your payment and credit card details.

### 2. Directly deleting your Credit Card:

You can also delete your credit card details directly but not by visiting &#8220;Ad Manager&#8221;, rather you can delete it from the account settings itself. This method is simple but I recommend you to suspend your Ads first as given in the above method.

You can directly delete it by going to your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?ref=mb&drop" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?ref=mb&drop', 'account settings page']);" target="_blank">account settings page</a>. After that click &#8220;Payments&#8221; from the left sidebar and check your payment methods by clicking &#8220;Manage&#8221; on that page as shown below. Click remove to delete your payment method.
