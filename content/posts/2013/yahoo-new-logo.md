Yahoo today unveiled its new logo. The Yahoo logo has been the same for over the last 18 years. Yahoo had previously run a 30 days of change campaign where everyday for a month a variation of the logo was posted. Yahoo has had [major failures over the years][1] and still is considered a company with a tricky future. But in the last year, under a new CEO it has tried very hard to re-invent itself.

So here is the newly designed logo for Yahoo against different backgrounds.<figure id="attachment_77533" style="width: 488px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-77533" title="Yahoo's New Logo" alt="Yahoo New Logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/09/Yahoo-New-Logo.png" width="488" height="367" />][2]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yahoo&#8217;s New Logo</figcaption></figure> 

The new logo does not have any straight lines. The letters have thin and thick strokes.

The new logo is not impressive. It is different mainly in the context of typography but still retains the idea of spelling out the word &#8220;Yahoo!&#8221; from the old logo.Â By the way, here is the old logo which Yahoo has discarded.<figure id="attachment_77534" style="width: 383px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Marissa Mayer is a ex-Google employee who took over as Yahoo CEO. She is a geek and has tried to reinvent Yahoo back to its geeky glory. The Yahoo CEO has not disappointed with her hands on with the new logo designing process. She also outlined the process of creating the new logo in a <a href="http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/60336044815/geeking-out-on-the-logo" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/60336044815/geeking-out-on-the-logo', 'blog post']);" >blog post</a>.</span>

Yahoo has lately over the last year made a lot of noise. They firstly [bought Tumblr and rolled out 1 TB free hosting space for photos on Flickr][4]. They have revamped email services with a new interface or rather phased out the older email interface. Yahoo mail is even offering saving attachments directly into Dropbox accounts as they do not have their own cloud sync service. Yahoo seems to be getting its act togeather but I feel it might be too late for it to ever reach its former glory.

Getting back to the new logo for Yahoo, what do you think about it? Do drop in your comments.
