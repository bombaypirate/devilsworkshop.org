Chrome was one of the first browsers to have address bar and search bar as a single feature, which they call it Omnibox. It makes Chrome look much better in design with less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_chrome#User_interface_and_interaction_design" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_chrome#User_interface_and_interaction_design', '&#8216;chrome&#8217;']);" >&#8216;chrome&#8217;</a>.

There&#8217;s a weird problem, though. Most of the people still visit Google.com and type in the search box. That&#8217;s why Google has revamped Chrome&#8217;s new tab page, placing a search box in the center.

As you can see from the screenshot above, the Google logo and search box grabs more attention than the Most Visited websites&#8217; thumbnails.

There are just 4 websites listed under Most Visited list and you can&#8217;t rearrange them either.

As you focus the search bar and start typing, Google will show suggestions and will load the results page in almost a blink of eye. It&#8217;s powered by Google Instant (which you can turn on/off in search settings).

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-72417" alt="google-instant" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-21-at-7.49.54-PM-600x399.gif" width="600" height="399" />][2]

It also won&#8217;t show the long URL you generally see in address bar when you search on Google.

There&#8217;s no way to navigate to Apps page from the new tab, except that you can pin it to Bookmarks bar for quick access.

If you want to try these features, get <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html', 'Chrome Canary']);" >Chrome Canary</a> (bleeding edge version of Chrome). None of these features are final and they&#8217;re yet to be added to stable build of Chrome.
