Since [Google Readers day were numbered][1], I thought for a while of moving away from RSS feeds and replacing it with Twitter. I found some [Google Reader alternatives][2] and I abandoned the idea of replacing RSS feeds. Now I wanted something that coverts Twitter accounts into RSS feeds.

Twitter used to support RSS feeds officially sometime ago. But it has since abandoned RSS and expects people to follow accounts on apps and the browser.

### Twitter-RSS Features

  * *Twitter-Rss.com *is a website that allows users to create RSS feeds of any Twitter account.
  * Just enter the username of the account you want and click on **&#8220;Get RSS&#8221;**.
  * The RSS feeds is generated and its URL can be used on most Feed readers.

I found Twitter-RSS is useful for following a Twitter account for news with continuous updates. Also it is useful mainly for people who are extremely active on Twitter.
