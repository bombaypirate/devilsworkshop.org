### What could Facebook be building?

Conspiracy theorist in me could go wild thinking that they might be announcing a new Facebook phone or a Facebook browser. Maybe even a new overhaul of the design (very unlikely) as I am not a fan of the Facebook&#8217;s current design.

But the saner voice in me suggests it would me something related to making revenues and doing that on mobile phones. So they might be rolling out new services which allow them to make money from their Facebook app across various mobile platforms. It has only in recently started pushing better designed [native apps for Android][1] and [iPhone users][2].

Whatever it is, we will be covering it here. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
