Google App Engine, the cloud computing service platform has recently started support for PHP. WordPress is probably the most popular PHP based software used, so it is no surprise that an official <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-app-engine/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-app-engine/', 'WordPress plugin for Google App Engine']);" >WordPress plugin for Google App Engine</a> was released.Â The plugin is mainly useful for functionality like sending email using the Mail App API and also uploading and serving media from Google Cloud Service.

This plugin is not meant for general WordPress users as they will need to know how to deploy PHP applications on Google App Engine. The plugin will over-ride some core WordPress functionality, mainly the email and media upload functionality.
