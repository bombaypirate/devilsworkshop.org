While researching something online, you might get an important call or need to go somewhere to a important meeting. That can be irritating especially as you need to save your files and sync them over Google Drive or Dropbox and [save your browser tabs with a handy extension][1]. CupCloud gets both syncing files and tabs working with a single click.

Firstly <a href="http://cupcloud.com/download" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cupcloud.com/download', 'download CupCloud']);" >download CupCloud</a> and install it on your computer. It works with Windows and OS X. I have tested it only on my Windows PC.

Now start working and when ever you need to save a bunch of tabs and word and excel documents open on your computer, just start the CupCloud software and click on &#8220;Cup&#8221;.<figure id="attachment_78667" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Once done, it will store all your open tabs and files with a single click.<figure id="attachment_78670" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

If you create an account with Cup Cloud, you can open and sync tabs and folders across different computers. Currently Cup Cloud supports Chrome, Safari and among browsers. It also supports MS Word, Excel and Power Point files along with support for Windows Explorer and Mac Finder.

Do note that the product is still in beta and promises to support more file types.

Do try out Cup Cloud and let me know what you think of it in your comments.
