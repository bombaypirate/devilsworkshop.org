Google Photosphere helps you shoot 360 degrees photos, wide angle shots and even that&#8217;s above or below you. Google Photosphere is limited to the Nexus devices. Recently Google launched the stock Galaxy S4 and [stock HTC One][1]. Both these devices were found to sport a redesigned stock camera app.Â This camera app APK has been ripped out by <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2340858" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2340858', 'WinDroidGuy from XDA developers']);" title="New Camera App APK on XDA">WinDroidGuy from XDA developers</a>.

This camera ap APK file brings Photosphere to non Nexus devices. It works flawless on your Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy S4 with TouchWiz, Galaxy S3 and HTC One with Sense. It is assumed that this new camera app will run flawless in all the latest devices running Jelly Bean.

This new camera app shows a minor change in the radical menu. It&#8217;s in the form of a semi circle now [like in Android 4.3][3]. The settings shown in the camera app are now more visible. This is sure to give the user more control. Also, with this new camera app, you can take photos by pressing the Volume Up or Down key.

## Few Things to Note

If you are running CyanogenMod 10.1 or above, you&#8217;ll have to uninstall the existing Gallery.apk first and then install this camera app APK. And also note that the image quality in this camera app is found to be bad compared to those shot with the default OEM camera app.
