Blogger users can now enable Google+ comments on their blogs. This will allow anyone with a Google+ account to simply leave a comment on a blog post. This has a double advantage, as the post can also be shared automatically on your Google+ timeline. So there is a social element to it, which means if someone comments on your post, their followers on Google+ might discover the post.

**How it works:**

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/04/Google+-Comments-Enable.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-73387" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="Google+ Comments Enable" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/04/Google+-Comments-Enable.png" /></a>
</p>

  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Visit your Blogger Dashboard and look under Google+ section. This will show the admin a new option to enable Google+ comments.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Once your blog allows Google+ comments, anyone signed into Google+ can comment and share the post using their account.</span>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/04/Blogger-Comments-on-Google+.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-73392" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="Blogger Comments on Google+" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/04/Blogger-Comments-on-Google+-600x249.png" /></a>
</p>

  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The privacy options also remain, which means you can comment and limit the audience your comment is visible to.</span>

### Why Google+ comments are important?

Google+ comments is in a way something similar to Facebook comments. But with Google+, you account is not just a social media tool but also is used for showing author of a particular page with Google&#8217; authorship program. At the moment Google+ has not made this commenting system available outside the blogger platform. I think they might do that very soon, possibly during Google IO 2013 which takes place on May 15 -17 next month.
