Google Play never officially supported debit cards for app purchases, but few debit cards <a href="http://www.razzil.com/axis-bank-visa-debit-card-google-wallet-issue.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.razzil.com/axis-bank-visa-debit-card-google-wallet-issue.html', 'like that of ICICI Bank&#8217;s do work']);" >like that of ICICI Bank&#8217;s do work</a>. But if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re left out with a debit card which Play store doesn&#8217;t support. This was the case only until I found out EntroPay, which lets you get Virtual Credit cards (VCCs), and guess what, Play store supports them.

### Getting an EntroPay card

The process is pretty simple. You <a href="https://secure2.entropay.com/unprot/registration/userInformation.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://secure2.entropay.com/unprot/registration/userInformation.html', 'head over to EntroPay']);" >head over to EntroPay</a>, fill the sign up form with details that match the one on your credit/debit card (which is just a precaution).

As the account is created, you&#8217;ll be asked to recharge your card for the first time, the minimum amount you can deposit is 20$. You can deposit via credit/debit cards or even bank transfer.

EntroPay takes certain amount of money you deposited as fees, which depends on whether you deposited via credit/debit card or bank transfer. For example, if you have deposited via a credit/debit card, 4.95% of the deposited money is taken as fees. <a href="https://secure2.entropay.com/static/pages/terms.charges.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://secure2.entropay.com/static/pages/terms.charges.html', 'Check the Fees page']);" >Check the Fees page</a> on the site for more information.

After all this gets done, you&#8217;ll be granted a virtual credit card, which looks something the screenshot above.

## Using EntroPay card on Google Play

After that&#8217;s done, you have to <a href="https://wallet.google.com/manage/#CreateInstrumentPlace:" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://wallet.google.com/manage/#CreateInstrumentPlace:', 'go to Google Checkout']);" >go to Google Checkout</a> (which is basically what&#8217;s used in Play store) and enter details of the EntroPay VCC.

This is the tricky part, as it asks for address &#8211; while denying your actual home address. The solution is to put address of EntroPay&#8217;s headquarters which are located in Malta. You can get the address from the <a href="https://www.entropay.com/contact-us" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.entropay.com/contact-us', 'contact page on their site']);" >contact page on their site</a>.

This is how the address should look (including country, pin code and city):

And you&#8217;re almost done.

Next time while you&#8217;re buying an app on Play store&#8217;s website or the Android app, select the VCC which you just created (you&#8217;ll be shown a list of cards available from Google Checkout).

I&#8217;ve tried all this personally and can assure that it works.[

This is not restricted to Play store, though. It should work for others too, like Skype credits (haven&#8217;t given a try for App store).
