InstaMessage is a free app for the Android devices that helps you to chat privately with other Instagrammers. The app is available on iOS as well as the Android platform. This app is simple and is really easy to use. It requires no registration. It uses your Instagram login credentials to work.

Once you download the app and install, you&#8217;ll be asked to set a cover photo, update your status and set other personal information. The app has four sections shown at the bottom : **Explore, Chats, Friends **and **Profile**.
