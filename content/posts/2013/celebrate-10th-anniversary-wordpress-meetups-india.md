The meetups will take place on **27th May **in many cities. If you are interested in meeting up with local WordPress enthusiasts then look up this <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/', 'list of meetups']);" >list of meetups</a> being planned.

If you find none in your city, you can even plan create your own meetup for your city or town.

### Why are meetups important?

Meetups are very important for WordPress communities. Especially in [India, where a lot of WordCamps have started to take place][1] but very few small WordPress meetups are happenings. Being an open-source project no company is going to put a lot of resources in marketing events to get local developers and bloggers together  Hence such meetups organized from ground up are very important.

I will be attending the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/Mumbai-IN/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/Mumbai-IN/', 'meetup in Mumbai']);" >meetup in Mumbai</a> and hopefully will meet some fascinating people from the WordPress community in the city.

Do drop in your comments.
