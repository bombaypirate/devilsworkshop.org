[<img class="wp-image-76714 alignright" title="Moto X Invitation" alt="Moto_X_invite" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/07/Moto_X_invite-582x600.jpg" width="251" height="259" />][1]Google owned Motorola has finally announced an event where the new phone &#8220;Moto X&#8221; is expected to be announced. Motorola has been struggling to become profitable over the past few years when Google acquired it. It was expected that someday Motorola will churn out a Google phone now that it is part of Google. The event will be held in New York.

Google does announce Nexus phones which gives the pure Android experience every year but with Nexus phones they are basically working with a company with their own limitations and agendas. With Motorola, Google has complete control of the device so expectations from this phone will be high.

### What to expect from &#8220;Moto X&#8221;?

Just about everything related to Moto X has been secret. Google has done a very good job on keeping things secret *(which makes me wonder if phone leaks are done on purpose)*.

The phone is expected to have some features like listening to voice command at all times even when the phone is idle or showing icon based notifications when the phone is idle. These features were leaked by Canada based mobile operator Roger Wireless ([Check out the leaked video][2]).

Sundar Pichai the man who heads Android and Chrome at Google, is also hosting an event on the 24th July. So we should be expecting a new version of Android very soon. This new version of Android will most probably be shipped with &#8220;Moto X&#8221;.

### Motorola&#8217;s success is important to Google

Google recently has been investing a lot of money into Motorola and also writing off losses. That is sustainable in the short run but for an increasing mobile and tablet world, advertising revenues might soon stagnate for Google. Google needs Motorola to basically pay for itself if not earn it handsome profits. Will it work out? Only time will tell.
