One of my favourite [feature on Facebook pages is that it allows users to schedule posts][1]. This allows a page owner to post an update for maximum visibility. It also means the posts can be spaced out and not spam someones timeline. Google+ Pages are also popular with bloggers to share their posts online but unfortunately there seem to be no option to schedule posts. This feature itself is completely missing on Google+.

But [Bufferapp which also allows scheduling of tweets on multiple accounts][3], has introduced scheduling options with Google+.

This allows users to hook up their <a href="http://bufferapp.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bufferapp.com/', 'Google+ page to Buffer']);" >Google+ page to Buffer</a> and schedule posts at separate times and dates.

**Some Limitations!**

There are restrictions on the number of posts you can schedule and also the number of accounts you can use with Buffer with the free package.

I was a little disappointed with BufferApp not supporting posting to Google+ profiles but it seems to be an issue on Google&#8217;s side. Google has not released a Read/Write version of its Google+ Profile API. This means we are not going to see 3rd party apps being able to schedule and post on Google+ profiles anytime soon.

Try out BufferApp for Google+ pages. Do let me know about your views and any similar services in your comments.
