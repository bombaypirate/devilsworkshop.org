Facebook is pushing a new design to its iconic &#8220;Like&#8221; button. The &#8220;Like&#8221; button is now more or less a constant on just about any website, to get visitors sharing links on their own Facebook profiles.

Today, Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/11/06/introducing-new-like-and-share-buttons/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/11/06/introducing-new-like-and-share-buttons/', 'developer blog']);" >developer blog</a> introduced a new way the &#8220;Like&#8221; button will show up. The new button has vectorised design. Facebook is also introducing the option of getting websites to use both the &#8220;Like&#8221; and &#8220;Share&#8221; button. The two buttons seem similar to people but they are actually very different. The &#8220;Share&#8221; button allows users to add a comment to the link they are sharing on their timeline. The &#8220;Like&#8221; button only shares the link on a users timeline.<figure id="attachment_78545" style="width: 429px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### How does one test the new &#8220;Like&#8221; button?

The Facebook &#8220;Like&#8221; and &#8220;Share&#8221; buttons are used by 7.5 million websites. But rolling out the new buttons to websites over time, Facebook is rolling the new button design to a percentage of users.

This is a bit strange as it might mean that a website owner might not see the newly designed button while visitors to the site might get to see the button. This could be problematic especially if the new design breaks or does not go well with the overall design of a website.

Are you seeing the new &#8220;Like&#8221; button and do you like it? üòâ Do drop in your comments.
