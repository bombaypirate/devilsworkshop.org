While both Android and iOS ship with Calculator apps by default, there are no stock Converter apps. So, you&#8217;ve to rely on third party apps. Flib is one such unit converter app, releasing for both iOS and Android.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74483" alt="Flib on Android" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/Screenshot_2013-05-22-13-38-07-337x600.png" width="337" height="600" />][1]

Flib really stands from the competition with its user interface. The icons look flat and neat and there are neat flipping (that&#8217;s why the name &#8216;Flib&#8217;) transitions here and there. Of course, the main focus is still on converting units.

There are a lot units available &#8211; starting from area, length, volume to energy, speed, temperature and to even time. If the list is missing the unit you want, you can always mail the app developers for a feature request. It doesn&#8217;t convert currency, for example.

Flib is pretty smart too, it shows the most used conversions on the first screen, for easy access.Â Finally, you can customise the interface too! Basically, you can set your desired colour for the interface.

The app is available for free and can be tried on Android right now. It is also tablet ready.

For iPhones, the app will be releasing pretty soon. You can <a href="http://www.tendaysoneapp.com/#iOS" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tendaysoneapp.com/#iOS', 'sign up for the mailing list']);" >sign up for the mailing list</a> to get notified as it releases.
