Google integrated every chat platform Google has created into a single one named &#8220;Hangouts&#8221;. Codenamed &#8220;Babel&#8221;, Google Hangouts was announced at the [Google I/O 2013 event][1]. Hangouts will make cross-platform chatting or messaging a lot more easier.

While Hangouts looks pretty brilliant both on the outside and the inside, it is still in it&#8217;s development stages. The Google+ Messenger still exists on the Android ecosystem. Google is yet to kick that and merge that into Hangouts.

Hangouts isn&#8217;t as impressive as Google Talks. Hangouts lacks some of the most basic features like displaying the online status of a particular contact properly. The Hangouts app on Android doesn&#8217;t show which friends are online at present. But the Hangouts on Gmail for web gives you a hint of the online status &#8211; that is, the online friends&#8217; display picture is highlighted with a green line at the bottom.
