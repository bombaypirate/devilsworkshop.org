Do you Google a person? In today&#8217;s super connected world, often we are introduced to people via Facebook or Twitter and not exactly in person. If we have to know more about this person professionally a quick search on Google is useful. But Googling someone&#8217;s name can also be considered weird behaviour. Here is a nice flowchart for us to decide when exactly is it appropriate to Google someone.<figure id="attachment_79197" style="width: 450px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-79197" title="Should I Google This Person" alt="Should I Google This Person" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/12/Should-I-Google-This-Person-450x600.jpg" width="450" height="600" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Should I Google This Person?</figcaption></figure> 

Some of the instances described are funny, life if you work for NSA, Google has already given you all the information, while some is sound advice that it is unwise to Google someone who is standing right next to you. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
