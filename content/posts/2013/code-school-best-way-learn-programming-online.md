If you&#8217;re a newbie at programming and want to kickstart your career by learning programming online, you&#8217;re[ left with a lot of choice][1]. There&#8217;s CodeAcademy, Khan Academy, Udacity and many others.

Code School is a similar site which I stumbled upon recently, and I was really impressed with it. It seems to better than all the sites I&#8217;ve tried before.

[<img role="img" class="wp-image-70111" alt="code-school" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/01/Codeschool-1024x416.png" width="620" height="251" />][2]

The main thing which sets Code School apart is their high quality screencasts &#8211; which is a much better way to learn than going through documentation (especially for beginners).

After you have watched the screencasts, you&#8217;ll be able to write code in browser itself, completing challenges. As you complete a course, corresponding badge will be added to your profile page, which you can make public for sharing with others.

I have started learning Git and it&#8217;s going really well. Apart from screencasts, you&#8217;ll also be given access to slides for referring to later.

The courses are pretty good in number, covering most of web designing (HTML5, CSS3, JQuery), iOS development, Git, Ruby and lot more. If the course you wanted isn&#8217;t listed, you can ping and <a href="https://twitter.com/codeschool" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/codeschool', 'ask them on Twitter']);" >ask them on Twitter</a>, they&#8217;re pretty active there.

While Code School isn&#8217;t exactly free, they do provide few of the courses for free and more over, you can have access to all courses for free for 48 hours when you sign up initially. If your friends sign up for Code School under your referral link, you&#8217;ll be getting free access for 2 extra days.
