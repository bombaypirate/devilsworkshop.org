PDF have survived the the post-PC world. As a matter of fact, I think we will read a lot more PDFs because there will a lot more tablets being sold. Most websites do not publish content that really needs to be saved as a PDF file, but it might be necessary if you want to save a tutorial or a long 5000 word article.

As I accessing my files on different computers I tend to use Google Drive. Here is a handy Chrome extension I came across that converts a HTML page into PDF and saves it to your Google Drive.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/01/HTML-to-PDF-Save-Google-Drive.png"><img class=" wp-image-70568 aligncenter" alt="HTML to PDF Save Google Drive" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/01/HTML-to-PDF-Save-Google-Drive.png" width="592" height="427" /></a>
</p>

### How it works:

  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Download and install the &#8220;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-google-docs/cppogeekogbladboceekjeiibihnkbhp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-google-docs/cppogeekogbladboceekjeiibihnkbhp', 'Send to Google Docs']);" >Send to Google Docs</a>&#8221; extension on your Chrome browser. The extension will show up a new icon next to the Chrome omnibar (address bar).</span>
  * Now while looking up a website, just click on the icon.
  * The HTML page is converted into a PDF document. It opens a preview within Google Drive.

**Some Negatives:**

You have to be logged into your Google Account for this extension to work. Ofcourse that means we are not sharing our Google ID and passwords with a 3rd party, so it is not exactly a but drawback.

The files are stored by default in the root directory of Google Drive. Unfortunately it does not have the option of choosing a default folder to send the PDF to.
