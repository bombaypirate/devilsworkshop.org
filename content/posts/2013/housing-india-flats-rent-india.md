I am sure searching for a new house in India is not exactly a smooth process. There are many website in India to search for properties but I found <a href="http://housing.co.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://housing.co.in/', 'Housing.co.in']);" ><strong><em>Housing.co.in</em></strong></a> very innovative and unique.

The website&#8217;s best feature is how simple it is to look up apartments to rent or buy from the major cities in India.Currently the website caters to Mumbai, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Pune, Bangalore, Noida and Ghaziabad.<figure id="attachment_77035" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### How <a href="http://housing.co.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://housing.co.in/', 'Housing.co.in']);" >Housing.co.in</a> works

  * The service uses a very innovative interface based on Google Maps. The left column shows a list of available flats for rent or to buy based on your search.
  * Selecting one of the flats it shows details of the flat in a pop-up. This includes details like expected rent, photos, details and even a bit of information about the neighbourhood. The phone number to the agent is also listed.
  * House hunting becomes easy as we can save a lot of favourites and then look through each individually at a later date.

The service also has mobile apps for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.locon.housing" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.locon.housing', 'Android']);" >Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/housing-india/id681756431" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/housing-india/id681756431', 'iPhone']);" >iPhone</a>. Overall, I did use this to search for information in my area of residence and found a lot of accurate data.

Do try out <a href="http://housing.co.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://housing.co.in/', 'Housing.co.in']);" >Housing.co.in</a> and drop in your comments.
