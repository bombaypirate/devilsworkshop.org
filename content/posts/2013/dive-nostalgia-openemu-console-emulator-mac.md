Here&#8217;s a christmas present for all you video gaming nerds who played the epic 8-bit and 16-bit console games of past.

OpenEmu &#8211; a console game emulator, lets you run all the pixel games seamlessly.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-79142" alt="OpenEmu" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-25-at-9.54.02-pm-600x447.png" width="600" height="447" />][1]

As the name suggests, it&#8217;s an open source project and a few days back, stable release of Mac app has been out.

To get started, download the Mac app from <a href="http://openemu.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://openemu.org/', 'OpenEmu&#8217;s website']);" >OpenEmu&#8217;s website</a>. Also download the <a href="http://openemu.org/files/homebrew-all.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://openemu.org/files/homebrew-all.zip', 'Starter Game pack']);" >Starter Game pack</a>, and drop them in the app to import. That&#8217;s all you have to do, to install a game, i.e. just drop the ROM file.

The app&#8217;s design is strikingly good, which is not something you expect from a console emulator. You can build collections, categorise your games and rate them.

Games can be played in fullscreen and can be saved for resuming at a later time.

You can even plug in your game pad/controller and use it just like that. I tried with my Xbox 360 controller and it worked fine, though I did needed to install the Mac-specific driver. Controls can be changed in the preferences window.

On a whole, it&#8217;s a polished and well made app. Also free, so why not give it a try?
