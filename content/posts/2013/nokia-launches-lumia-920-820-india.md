It&#8217;s official: Nokia has launched two flagship phones of its Windows Phone 8 lineup &#8211; Lumia 920 and 820, in India. Lumia 620 on the other hand, is said to be available in February.

### Lumia 920 and 820: features and specifications

Nokia calls Lumia 920 as the most innovative phone, while I won&#8217;t take it so far, they definitely have brought lot of new stuff to the table.

  * Lumia 920 features a uni-body design, built using polycarbonate. Lumia 820 shows off a more open design with removable battery and (customizable) shell.
  * Lumia 920 is powered by a 4.5&#8243; PureMotion HD+ display, while the 820 has a 4.3&#8243; AMOLED display.
  * The camera on 920 uses Pureview technology and OIS (Optical image stabilization) with a 8.7 MP sensor. Lumia 820&#8217;s camera has a resolution of 8 MP.
  * Both the phones ship with Windows Phone 8, along with built-in Lumia apps like Nokia Music, which lets users stream music (or download) for free for one year.
  * Wireless charging and NFC capabilities stand out.
  * The official pricing for Lumia 920 is **RS 38,199**, and Lumia 820 is **RS 27,559**.

### Time for revival for Nokia?

Personally, I think Nokia has really given its best for the hardware side of both of these phones &#8211; the design, build quality and camera are impressive. Not to forget the software side like Nokia Drive, City Lens, Music and many other Lumia-specific apps.

Just compare this with an Android OEM, like HTC or Samsung. They only cripple the software with their own versions of Android and make it worse, can you think of any amazing HTC-specific or Samsung-specific feature? I can&#8217;t. Heck, have you seen them making a phone which is well-designed, very durable and available in multiple colours &#8211; all at the same time?

Of course, all this is just the positive side of a Lumia, there&#8217;s a negative side which is called Windows Phone 8. WP still lacks majority of apps and nothing matters more than apps in a smartphone.

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the new Lumia lineup will do in India. Tell us what you think.
