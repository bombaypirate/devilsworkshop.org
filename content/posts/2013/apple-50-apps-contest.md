Apple&#8217;s App store is serving up millions of app downloads everyday. With apps for iPod, iPhones, iPads, the app ecosystem has amplified the number of apps downloaded form the App store. The number of app downloads is fast reaching 50 Billion. Apple has launched a new contest which will rewards people who download apps from the app store.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73775" alt="App store 5 billion downloads" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/App-store-5-billion-downloads.png" width="591" height="455" />][1]

  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The first prize is a US $10,000 app store gift card. The winner is the user who completes the 50 billionth app download for the app store.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Additional prizes include $500 gift card for the next 50 customers who download an app.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Ideally the person taking part in this competition has to be atleast 13+ years old (or the eligible</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"> age based on country) and total app download limit per day is 25 apps.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">These apps do not need to be purchased, even the free ones are included in the app downloads.</span>

The chances of winning this prize though small, it might be a good idea to download those apps you wanted this month, just in case you hit the jackpot.

This is a very different way to promote more app downloads than [Google which offered discounts on App purchases to celebrate its 25 billion app downloads][2] milestone.
