The Android ecosystem is coded beautifully and provides a huge collection of apps that one can use. But the most amazing thing with the Android world is that, one can easily root one&#8217;s Android device and get much more interesting stuff. The Android owners can easily ditch the stock ROM and move on to [popular custom ROMs like CyanogenMod][1]. But installing custom ROMs need root access to that Android device.

Rooting a particular Android device can be really easy, provided you have the necessary guide. You can easily root your Android device by doing a simple search on Larry Page&#8217;s most favorite search engine. Just type **root guide for <your Android device name with model number>** and you&#8217;ll results.

Once you root your Android device, you&#8217;ll need a custom recovery tool like ClockworkMod Recovery to flash the custom ROM. Custom recovery tools like ClockworkMod Recovery are far better than the stock recovery because the latter enlists many restrictions from the manufacturer and also is much feature-less.
