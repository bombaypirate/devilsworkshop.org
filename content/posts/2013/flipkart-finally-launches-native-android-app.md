Flipkart has finally revamped it&#8217;s Android mobile app. It was just a mobile version of the Flipkart website put as an app earlier. But this upgraded version has been built from scratch and offers a beautiful user interface. The app comes packed with almost every Flipkart feature.

The user interface is now much improved. The slider menu on the left side makes navigation easy. Easily search products in various departments, search for products using text/voice and even scan barcodes. You can also sort/filter the products based on popularity, price (low to high and high to low), and discounts.

You can also check the products&#8217; images zoomed in, check out the user reviews and ratings.

You can also buy things right within the app. Payment is by Cash on Delivery, Debit/Credits cards, Net Banking and EMIs &#8211; just like the payment options on the Flipkart website. Once purchased, you can track the status of your orders right within the app. This is a big improvement.

There is something interesting that Flipkart brought in this updated Android app. You can check the details of the recently viewed products even when the network is not available.

Also, Flipkart gives you an option to share your purchases with your Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and other social networking site friends.
