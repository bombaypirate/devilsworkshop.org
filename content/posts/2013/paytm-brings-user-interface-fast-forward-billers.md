<a href="https://www.paytm.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.paytm.com/', 'Paytm ']);" title="Paytm">Paytm </a>is the leading mobile, data recharges and bill payments service in India. It has a new user interface, a new feature called *Fast Forward* and new billers now.

**#1 New user interface**

The user interface has been *revamped completely*, is simple and shows everything necessary in one single page. The Paytm logo has also been given a revamp.

**#2 &#8216;Fast Forward&#8217; for quick recharges**

There is no denying that having your Paytm cash loaded helps you make recharges within seconds. Patym cash has been useful till date and is still in use.

*Fast Forward* is a new option in the recharge section that helps you make recharges in one click. After you enter the recharge details, enable the *Fast Forward* option, available below in the recharges section, to immediately make the recharge. You should make sure that your Paytm cash is loaded, or you will face troubles.

**#3 New Billers**

Paytm has a couple of new billers now. They are :

  1. Mahanagar gas service
  2. 2 new landline billers &#8211; MTNL and Tata
  3. 5 new electricity billers &#8211; BSES, Tata Power, Reliance energy, MSEB

And also, Paytm has waived the additional fee placed on postpaid bills for a short time now.
