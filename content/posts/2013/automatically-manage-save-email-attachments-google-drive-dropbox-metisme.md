My relatives very rarely send me emails except when they want to share photos of the family. Not everyone is comfortable with photos being uploaded and shared on Facebook or Google+. But I prefer to save my attachments on Google Drive (or Dropbox). A [single click solution is available as a Chrome extension][1] but I liked MetisMe, which automatically saves attachments from certain address to your chosen cloud service.<figure id="attachment_77949" style="width: 770px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

As you can see in the image above, installing the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metisme-attachments-manag/ngimbpnoapepdadjidgcdaiijfedckid" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metisme-attachments-manag/ngimbpnoapepdadjidgcdaiijfedckid', 'MetisMe Chrome extension']);" >MetisMe Chrome extension</a> allows me it to sort my attachments. Most importantly I can make quick rules to send attachments from certain email ids to either Dropbox, Evernote or Google Drive.

The service is still not open for public and there is still more work needed on the service. For instance, I found that it was showing me attachments from emails within my spam folder or previously deleted emails in the option called &#8220;Attachments Stack&#8221;.

If you want pre-launch access to MetisMe, you can use this link.

Try out MetisMe and drop in your comments and views.
