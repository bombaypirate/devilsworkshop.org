The smartphone has been a very important invention for the entire world and has increased the efficiency of day to day tasks in ways possibly not imagined by anyone when they were first launched.

There are a variety of ways through which you can cut down on the money you spend on your calls. There are a number of apps available that let you make calls for free through the internet. They are absolutely safe and are real money-savers.

Here I have chosen 5 apps that you can use on your phone and see the money piling up.

## Viber

**Available: iOS and Android**

[<img class=" wp-image-73373 alignright" alt="Viber" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/04/Viber.png" width="151" height="151" />][1] Viber has a very smooth and simple approach to the concept of making free calls.  What makes Viber a very useful app. It has no noticeable lags or delays on the audio while making calls.

Along with that feature it has the option of sending text messages, multimedia messages and e-mails.
