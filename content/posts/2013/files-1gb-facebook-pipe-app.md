A new app named Pipe is now on Facebook that makes file sharing between Facebook friends a lot more easier. This Facebook app comes bundled with many features. The recipient need not be online at the time of sharing the file. There is no need for the recipient to be using the app at the time of sending the file either.

**How it works:**

First visit the app page for <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/pipeapp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/pipeapp', 'Pipe on Facebook']);" >Pipe on Facebook</a>. The working interface of Pipe looks really simple. Once you start using this app, you&#8217;ll remember those golden Super Mario childhood days.

You just have to choose the friend to whom you want to send the file and then drag-and-drop the file in the green tube. The file will be sent immediately if that recipient if online at that time.

Once you have uploaded the file, the app will ask you permissions to notify your friend. It&#8217;s best to notify your friend about this file, or he/she may not download the file and Pipe will have to remove that file eventually.

If your friend is offline, the file will be stored in a special, safe location called **Locker** and Pipe will notify him/her the next time he/she is online. Note that files cannot be stored in the **Locker** forever. They can be stored for a maximum period of 5 days.
