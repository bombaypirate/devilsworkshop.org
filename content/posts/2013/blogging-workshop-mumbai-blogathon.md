### What is Blogathon all about?

Blogathon describes itself as a workshop for structured WordPress blogging and starting-up. I spoke with the organizer Niranjan, who explained to me about the concept behind Blogathon and what it is offering.

  * The two-day workshop will have speaker sessions on the first day. It will cover basics like how to go about blogging, starting a blog, introduction to self-hosted WordPress basics and CSS and design basics.
  * It will also showcase speakers who will explain concepts like SEO, content curation, publishing insights and more.
  * On the second day will entail practical sessions where attendees will be building their websites.

### India needs more Blogging + WordPress workshops

I strongly feel India needs more such workshops that are not just for developers or experts. Usually at conferences or talks I have attended, I found that newbies are often ignored and they are more or less lost.

It is good to see an initiative like Blogathon which is going to have practical sessions for bloggers who are new and need a bit of hand-holding.
