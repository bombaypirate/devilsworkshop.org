Here are some of the basic specs and some unique features.

### Galaxy S4 Unique Image and Video Features

  * **Dual Camera Mode:** The phone has two cameras front and back. Dual Camera mode allows the user to take a photo with both cameras and mix them in.
  * **Drama Shot:** More than a 100 shots in 4 seconds and can be used as a collage in a single frame.

  * **Story Album:** Users can create story album of photos and videos from a holiday. The unique part is users will be able to send hard copies of the album at a price.

I saw Samsung&#8217;s presentation&#8217;s webcast and it was pretty shoddy. It packed in too much information and mentioned feature after feature that really did not let what the phone could do sink in. But the Galaxy S IV is solid product and it will probably end up selling a lot more than Galaxy S III. The launch in New York was a sign of confidence by Samsung. It shows it is ready to face-off with the big names in the US (namely Apple).

The phone will be available in most countries by April.
