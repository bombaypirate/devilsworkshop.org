The development of a Twitter for Android tablets has been a sad story since a long time. Twitter for Android tablets was basically Twitter for Android mobile&#8217;s stretched version till yesterday. Today, Twitter has <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/twitter-for-android-now-on-tablets" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://blog.twitter.com/2013/twitter-for-android-now-on-tablets', 'announced ']);" title="Twitter for Android tablets">announced </a>the launch of Twitter for Android tablets on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1

This tablet-optimized app brings an user interface that packs more details for the users&#8217; advantage. Tweets, conversations, people to follow, trending topics &#8211; everything is shown. In the landscape mode, the navigation bar is thrown to the left side. Tapping a tweet brings the tweet&#8217;s details along with the multimedia and article previews.

As for now, Twitter for Android tablets is available only for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. Twitter announced that this app for other Samsung tablets will be coming &#8220;soon&#8221; and for the rest of the Android tablets &#8211; &#8220;by the end of this year&#8221;

There are two amazing things about this launch. This app will work in the multi-window feature available on the Samsung devices. Also, you can doodle on pictures with the Samsung S-Pen before tweeting the picture.

It is obvious that this Twitter app is exclusive for Samsung Galaxy Note but it is only a matter of time, until someone will pull off the APK file and upload it on the web.

### What this means to the Android community?

Since [Google&#8217;s I/O 2013 event][3], the Android studio, an Integrated Development Environment for Android, has proved to be useful tool for developers to make mobile and tablet optimized apps with ease. It helps them to preview apps made for various sizes screens and also make stage rollout of apps. Currently Android studio is free and is available as an *early access preview*.

In the case of Apple App Store, all the apps are classified as &#8216;for iPhone&#8217; and &#8216;for iPad&#8217;. With Twitter&#8217;s launch of this tablet optimized app, I believe that other Android developers will follow suit and launch tablet optimized apps soon.
