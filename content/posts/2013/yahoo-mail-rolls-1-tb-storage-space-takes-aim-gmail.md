Way back when free email services like Hotmail and Yahoo dominated the market, a upstart decided to disrupt the whole scene. Free email services were only offering a mere 2 or 5 MB space for your inbox, Google rolled out Gmail with 1 GB storage. Before Google became the big web giant it hired Marissa Mayer among it&#8217;s first few employees.

Marissa Mayer worked on web interface and web server projects but also spent time on some iconic projects like Gmail *(*<a href="http://www.biography.com/people/marissa-mayer-20902689" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.biography.com/people/marissa-mayer-20902689', 'source']);" rel="nofollow"><em>source</em></a>*) *and Google Maps among other things. Today the same Marissa Mayer is the CEO of Yahoo and now Yahoo is borrowing a page from Gmail and trying to be disruptive by offering a staggering 1 TB storage space with Yahoo Mail.

Yahoo Mail has a new interface with new themes that stay across platforms which other than web include Android, iOS and Windows. The important the changes are the 1 TB storage space, increasing the limit of filters to 200 up from 100 previously.  There is also a new compose layout.

It also allows attachment photos to be previewed in full screen.

Yahoo Mail&#8217;s new UI remains consistent on mobile devices. The Android and iPhone apps will also have a new swipe features. Yahoo is harnessing the power of Flickr photos to give beautiful new themes to users.  The 1 TB space is just so much, that it might be very lucrative for small businesses which are shelling out money for a lot less storage space with their email service.<figure id="attachment_78021" style="width: 318px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Yahoo Mail is very different than it was a year ago and it seems it is finally pulled its socks up. unfortunately Yahoo does does not have its own cloud storage service like Google Drive, but it has a [collaboration with Dropbox for allowing users to save attachments from Yahoo mail][3].

The new features are being rolled out starting today but I have not yet received the new look Yahoo Mail. If you have already got access to the new UI, do drop in your comments your views on it.
