Apple has started listing Apple TV for India on its website. The price according to <a href="http://www.bgr.in/news/apple-tv-launched-in-india-for-rs-7900/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bgr.in/news/apple-tv-launched-in-india-for-rs-7900/', 'BGR India']);" >BGR India</a> seems to be Rs. 7900. Apple TV is basically small box like device that connects to a TV set. The Apple TV box can then allow your TV set to connect with your iOS device like iPhone, iPad and iPods wirelessly.

One popular feature of Apple TV is Airplay. It allows you to basically push content or rather your screen onto the television set. This works great while watching a video on your phone and moving it to your Television set. It also uses iCloud to sync photos.

The big advantage that Apple TV will get is its [iTunes store which now has India specific content][2]. You can buy or rent popular movies and music.

### Who might want get Apple TV?

Firstly, make sure you have internet WiFi with a decent speed and supports unlimited download limit. Also Apple TV seems to make sense for people who are completely married to the iOS platfrom. For instance if you have a iPhone and a iPad, then getting this device for your TV might be a good idea.

India has long been ignored by Apple as a market not ready for its products. I have always thought otherwise as Apple products have a huge demand in India for a few years now.

All that seems to be changing now.
