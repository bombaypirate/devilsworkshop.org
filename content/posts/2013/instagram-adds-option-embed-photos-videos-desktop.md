Good news, Instagram users. Instagram now allows users to embed photos and videos anywhere. The embed code is available for every public Instagram photo or video.

It was just a month back when [Instagram announced Instagram videos][1]. And now, here is an option to embed photos and videos just like [Twitter&#8217;s Vine][2].

The embed code is available only on the Desktop version. When you see any photo or video, you&#8217;ll be shown a new share button next to the comments section. Clicking on that button will show the embed code. Copy that code and you can paste it on your blogs, forums and any other place!

Unfortunately, you won&#8217;t be able to embed these photos or videos on Twitter. Months back Instagram removed support for Twitter Cards and it&#8217;ll be so forever considering the fact that Twitter and Facebook are rivals.

Also, it&#8217;s best to note that you won&#8217;t be able to embed private photos.

Embedded photos and videos show the username at the top left and *Instagram* logo at the top right. Clicking on the name takes to the user&#8217;s Instagram page while clickfing on the logo takes to the photo or video&#8217;s page.

The number of *Likes* and *Comments* are also shown.
