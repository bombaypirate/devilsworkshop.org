Over a year ago, there was a survey done that showed that 48 of the top 100 blogs in the world were running on WordPress. That showed how the big blogs preferred WordPress as a platform it did not explain how much of the web used the platform. A couple of days ago, Matt Mullenweg (Founder of Automattic) gave a <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/27/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/27/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/', 'speech at WordCamp San Francisco 2013']);" >speech at WordCamp San Francisco 2013</a>. He shared an interesting bit of statistic, which was that now 18.9% of web was running on WordPress.<figure id="attachment_76827" style="width: 353px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### Future WordPress Updates

There was also an outline of future updates planned for WordPress. This included WordPress 3.7 version that is scheduled for early October. WordPress 3.7 will apparently be a version where major cleanup of the platform will be done. WordPress 3.8 is scheduled to be released in December this year.
