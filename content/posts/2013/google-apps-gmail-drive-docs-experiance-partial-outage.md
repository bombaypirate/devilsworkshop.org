Several of Google services are facing an outage. The outage seems to be partial but widespread. Gmail. Google Drive, Documents, Presentations, Spreadsheets all are facing downtime. Usually a service outage with one or two apps on Google happens from time to time, it usually does not happen with so many different services.

Here is a screenshot from <a href="http://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status&ts=1366223399000" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status&ts=1366223399000', 'Google&#8217;s app status dashboard']);" >Google&#8217;s app status dashboard</a>.

A major outage for a long time is bound to be be cause some major criticism. That said, Google usually has most services usually boast of over 99% of uptime regularly. But if Google wants more and more people to move to the cloud, downtime for more than an hour could soon be termed unacceptable.

I have personally not encountered any outage on my Google account today but if you have, would love read your comments.

**Update:** All affected services seem to be up and running now.
