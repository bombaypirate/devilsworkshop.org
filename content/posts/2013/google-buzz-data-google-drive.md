With Google+ proving to be gain momentum, the internet giant has finally decided to shut down it&#8217;s not-so-successful social network, Google Buzz. Google Buzz has been unavailable to the public since an year and finally Google has announced that all the Google Buzz posts/content will be sent to the user&#8217;s Google Drive account.

This move is actually a good one by Google that ensures that the users&#8217; have a backup of their Buzz history. Google will begin moving the data on July 17, and meanwhile you have three other options to access/download your Buzz content. You can choose one among these three :

  1. <span style="line-height: 14px;">You can check your Buzz history on your <a href="http://profiles.google.com/me" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://profiles.google.com/me', 'Google profile']);" title="Google Profiles"  target="_blank">Google profile</a>.</span>
  2. Download them using [Google Takeout][1].
  3. Access it on the <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/?pli=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/dashboard/?pli=1', 'Google Dashboard']);" title="Google Dashboard"  target="_blank">Google Dashboard</a>.
