Google Play which was formerly the Android Marketplace, was re-branded as a [big challenge that Google is mounting to Amazon and Apple][2]. The other two big services who sell content like movies, music, books and apps on devices. Today, to celebrate the one year anniversary of Google Play, it is rolling out a lot of discounts on apps, movies, music and magazines.

Just visit the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_2013_play_birthday?" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_2013_play_birthday?', 'Google Play promotion page']);" >Google Play promotion page</a> and you should be able to see the apps available free or at a discount. I checked

The discount and free apps will be given away for a limited period of time. So it won&#8217;t be a bad idea to check their birthday offers link once or twice a day to see if you can pick up something interesting.

### Not much choice for India!

I was looking forward to some discounts on books but it seems there is not hardly much choice for Indian users. I think only a few apps with discounts are available for users from India.

I think as I am using Android 4.0 ICS on my phone and not the latest Jelly Bean version hence it might be showing me lesser apps  as available for my phone. Also I am guessing tablets using Android will also get more apps to choose from.

If you have got a discount on a app from Google&#8217;s birthday offering, do let us know in your comments.
