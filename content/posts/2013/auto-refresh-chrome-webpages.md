There are times when we need to constantly refresh a particular webpage just because that webpage is not loading or we want to see new content in that page. Hitting the Refresh button or the F5 button on the keyboard is the probably tiresome. In such cases, extensions like Auto Refresh Plus can be of some help to us.

Auto Refresh Plus is a nifty Google Chrome extension that can refresh a particular webpage for a pre-defined time interval. Auto Refresh Plus is also useful when you want to keep refreshing the page till that page shows some new content or lose some content. This feature is called **Page Monitor**.

Auto Refresh Plus is available for download on the Chrome Web Store. The extension is really simple to use. On installing, a small icon gets added to the top right of your Google Chrome browser. You can then set instructions with ease like so :

  1. <span style="line-height: 14px;">Open the webpage that needs to be refreshed periodically.</span>
  2. Then click on that icon and select the time interval. You can also set a time interval of your own.

That&#8217;s it. It was really simple to configure, right? Once done, that particular web page will continue refreshing automatically. You can now proceed your work with the other tabs. That tab will continue refreshing on it&#8217;s own.

Auto Refresh Plus comes with various options. You can enables sounds to notify you when Page Monitor triggers. You can also choose what sound is to be played by inserting the sound URL in the settings section. The settings section also shows options to auto start refreshing and also set a predefined URL to be refreshed.

If you are using Firefox, there is an [addon][3] that does a similar job.
