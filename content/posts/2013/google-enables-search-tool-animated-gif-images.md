Remember all those weird animated images (usually .gif format) which are often funny and got a new lease of life on Google+ for a while? It seems Google wants users to be able to search more easily for animated images. A new update that is rolling out on Google search, allows a new option in image search. Just under Images on Google Search, and look up under Type and a new filter called &#8220;Animated&#8221; is made available.

The animated images shown are mainly GIF format images. Earlier if you had to search for animated images, users had to use a search operator ***filetype:**Â (Read about [most commonly used search operators on Google][1]).*

Though I assume there would be significantly more people using the new search filter than there were who used a search query like *&#8220;filetype:GIF India&#8221;.*

The new search filter actually might end up being useful as a traffic generator for some websites. There are always useful things that can be illustrated or explained using GIF images. Also looking at my social networking feeds I am guessing there still must be a lot of people searching of animated cat images or something similar.

Do drop in your comments.
