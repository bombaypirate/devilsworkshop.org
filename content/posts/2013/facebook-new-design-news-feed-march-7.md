Facebook has sent out invites to the Press for an event on March 7, 2013. The invite has a simple message, which is announcing a new look for the &#8216;news feed&#8217;.

One place where people spend most of their time on Facebook is looking through their news feeds. The design of the current News Feed is based on how it best looks on a desktop/laptop browser.Â But with Facebook being increasingly consumed on mobile and tablet screens, a new design was more or less expected.

Compared to say Google+ or even Flipboard (*which is an app not a social network*), the main news feed design of Facebook is boring, especially on mobile platforms.

### &#8216;News Feed&#8217; is the Money Earner for Facebook

Though one might wonder what is the big deal about a redesigned &#8216;News Feed&#8217; for Facebook. It is actually a very big deal because it is also where Facebook will be displaying some of its ads or sponsored updates.

It will be interesting to see whether Facebook gets it right or wrong.
