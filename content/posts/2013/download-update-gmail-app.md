Google has finally updated their app for Gmail on Google Play Store. The update brings a [major redesign of Gmail on browsers and also their apps][1]. Gmail has already started rolling out new design for browser users. The tabbed categories seem to have people excited and they show up on Android.

### What is new with Gmail App for Android?

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75051" alt="Gmail App - New redesign" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/06/Gmail-App-New-redesign-600x482.png" width="600" height="482" />][2]

  * First big change is the left side navigation bar. It slides out if on touching the top left hand corner.
  * The Navigation bar shows easy access to the categories your mail is sorted into and also the multiple Gmail accounts you have hooked up to the app.
  * It also supports swipe to refresh on the main screen. This is much better than searching for the refresh symbol that used to exist before. Overall the layout is cleaner and simpler to use.
