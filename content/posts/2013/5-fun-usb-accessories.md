Office life rarely comes with any included amenities, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to live with a drab and depressing work space. Our computers can also be used as a source of power for some very handy and fun USB accessories. Majority of these devices are readily available online over Amazon or Rediff for Indian readers.

<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">If your desk has a lot of tech equipment on it, you&#8217;ve probably noticed the unfortunate effect that your hot computer has on your ice-cold beverage. Never let the line between iced tea and hot tea get blurred again. Keep your drinks cold all day long with a handy USB drink cooler.</span>

With the right toys and gadgets, you can remedy the worst cubicle crises and keep your little corner of the office bright.

These USB gadgets are basically for fun and some are entertaining while others just fun. Ideally they are not the most efficient if used on a laptop. These sort of USB gadgets work best on desktop PCs which do not rely on a battery like a laptop or notebook.
