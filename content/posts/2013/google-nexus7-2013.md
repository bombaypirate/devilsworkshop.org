Google&#8217;s &#8220;Chrome + Android&#8221; event that saw the announcements of Nexus 7, Chromecast and Android 4.3. The Nexus 7 tablet is manufactured by Asus, just like last year. The Nexus 7 priced at US $229, will be available from 30th of July and is the first device to ship with Android 4.3 pre-installed.<figure id="attachment_76770" style="width: 433px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The Nexus 7 has some good power packed inside it with CPU specs being Snapdragon S4 Pro, 1.5 GHz. It has a faster GPU and 2 GB RAM. This added with being one of the first tablets to support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES#OpenGL.C2.A0ES.C2.A03.0_2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES#OpenGL.C2.A0ES.C2.A03.0_2', 'OpenGL  ES 3.0']);" >OpenGL  ES 3.0</a> standards.

The tablet packs a 5 MP rear camera and 1.2MP front facing camera. The big difference for Nexus 7 is display. It now sports a 7.02 inch screen, 1920 X 1200 HD display (323 ppi). This means the tablet should have the best screen display for a 7 inch tablet variant, unless Apple ships an iPad Mini with retina display* (which is unlikely to happen anytime soon)*. Nexus 7 supports WIFI, NFC and Bluetooth. It will be selling a optional 4G LTE version in the US.

### Google is focusing on &#8220;games&#8221; and &#8220;video&#8221; consumption

As a iPad Mini user, I can attest that anyone who I see using the tablet for the first time, in a few minutes ends up trying out a game. This is why the iPad is not just a tablet for one person (unlike a phone) but also is used by kids especially in a family environment. Google understands that and hence has focused on making Nexus 7 more interesting to gamers.<figure id="attachment_76773" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-76773" alt="Android 4.3 - has new feature called &quot;Restricted Profiles&quot; for parental control" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/07/Android-4.3-Restricted-profiles-600x564.png" width="600" height="564" />][2]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Android 4.3 &#8211; has new feature called &#8220;Restricted Profiles&#8221; for parental control</figcaption></figure> 

The tablet&#8217;s big focus on better processor hardware was a given but its focus on better display shows it is getting serious about gaming. It has also introduced &#8220;Restricted Profiles&#8221; with Android 4.3 for allowing parental control. It also stream hi-def video from Netflix which will drive video consumption.

In other words, what Android ecosystem might lack in exclusive tablet apps it is trying to catch up with better display and performance for gaming and video consumption. It is not entirely a misplaced idea as most people do consume a great deal of video and gaming content on tablet than say a phone where a dynamic app ecosystem really kicks in.

Google might also be trying to help matters with helpful new tools in the Android Studio new version announced at [Google IO 2013][3], but it is still a long way from match the quality of apps available on iPad.

It will be interesting to see what Apple comes out with later in the year and early next year in response to this Nexus 7 tablet. Do drop in your comments.
