Skype now has a 100 million downloads mark now. To celebrate this fantastic record, the Skype team has brought a completely new, redesigned Skype app for Android. Bearing the version tag 4.0, Skype for Android is now based on the Metro theme borrowed from the Windows 8 phones.

This is a full revamp of Skype for Android. It is said that the developers rebuilt the entire app from scratch. This new design aims at putting the conversations first. This update brings the conversations to your fingertips. Upon launching the updated app, you&#8217;ll notice three new sections : **Recents, Favorites **and **People.**
