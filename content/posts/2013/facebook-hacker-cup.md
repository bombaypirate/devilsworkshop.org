Facebook is well known for its hacking competition. If you have seen the movie &#8216;Social Network&#8217;, it showed how hacking match-offs would take place and the winner would be offered a job at Facebook.

Though I would not know if those stories are real or not, but Facebook does have a lot of respect for the hacking community. They show this respect by hosting an annual programming contest called the Hacker Cup.
