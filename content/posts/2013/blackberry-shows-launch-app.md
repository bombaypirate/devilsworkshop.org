BlackBerry has simply been having its worst year in its history. It has been totally sidelined as a major mobile phone manufacturer and its latest [Z10 and Q10][1] handsets have more or less flopped. Last week, it decided to get a part of that BlackBerry experience onto Android and iOS platforms. This was done by announcing the BBM app for iPhone and Android. The announcement was done in an <a href="http://blogs.blackberry.com/2013/09/bbm-for-android-iphone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.blackberry.com/2013/09/bbm-for-android-iphone/', 'official blog post']);" >official blog post</a> on 18th September. The BBM app for Android was to be made available on 21nd September and the iPhone app was to be released on 22nd September.

So far so good but the comedy of errors was about to start. Before the official Android app for BBM was posted online, an unofficial one got uploaded. The unofficial app was downloaded and over 1.1 million users went live inside 8 hours. That led to issues for BlackBerry which they apparently tried to fix but in the end had to roll back the global launch of the app.

The offending unofficially released BlackBerry app for Android was pulled and users who had downloaded it saw that the service was blocked. The few iPhone users who had downloaded the app could use it but app was pulled from the App Store too.

### So when is BBM for Android and iPhone available?

BlackBerry is a update post had mentioned that they were planning a staggered roll-out on Android and re-releasing the app on Apple App store. This update was made on the 21st September itself. A couple of day went by and BBM app was still nowhere to be seen. That is when BlackBerry&#8217;s BBM chief Andrew Bocking updated in another <a href="http://blogs.blackberry.com/2013/09/bbm-android-iphone-update/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.blackberry.com/2013/09/bbm-android-iphone-update/', 'blog post']);" >blog post</a>, that not only were they pulling the app but users should not expect the app to show up for another week. Strangely a **new release date is still not announced!**

<strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The doomed BlackBerry!</strong>

<strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"></strong>BlackBerry could not compete with the likes of Apple and Google in the mobile phone space. The new BBM app for Android and iPhone would have made them competitors to WhatsApp and WeChat and other similar messaging apps. But wait, even here BlackBerry will hardly compete as most users will simply not give its app a second chance *(whenever it gets actually released).*
