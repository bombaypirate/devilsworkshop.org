MailDrop is a service that helps you to create a disposable email ID. These email IDs do not expire like those from [10 Minute Mail][1], [Guerrilla Mail][2] or [TrashMail][3]. This service is new to this niche. Never the less, it has an elegant user interface and works flawless.

This service is free to use and doesn&#8217;t require a sign up. Creating an email ID is also easy. You&#8217;ll just have to enter your name or nickname and voila, the email ID is created! It also gives you some cool email ID suggestions.

## Some Restrictions in MailDrop

MailDrop might look really interesting to you at first. But there are some restrictions that come along with this service.

  * Email IDs require no passwords. So anyone can check out your email inbox.
  * The email size is limited to 100 kB and the attachments will be stripped off.
  * A maximum of 10 mails can be stored at a time.
  * If the inbox doesn&#8217;t receive an email for 24 hours, all the mails in the inbox will be deleted.

## Security Solution for MailDrop

With no password option for the email IDs, it&#8217;s easy for the public to dig into your mail inbox. MailDrop has a solution to this. The service provides an *Alias Address*. Every email ID created on MailDrop comes with an *Alias Address*. Email sent to the *Alias Address* also shows on the original inbox. People cannot see the *Alias Address* inbox without knowing the original address.

*Note : The privacy section of MailDrop states that the algorithm that converts real MailDrop addresses to inbox aliases is public and can be reverse engineered by anyone. So, it&#8217;s best **not** to send sensitive information on MailDrop*.
