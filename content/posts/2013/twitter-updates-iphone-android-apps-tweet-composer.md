Twitter has just sent a minor update to both its iPhone and Android apps showcasing a new Tweet composer.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74809" alt="Twitter for iPhone" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/iphonetwitter-338x600.jpg" width="338" height="600" />][1]

They have simplified the process of composing a tweet. For example, in the iPhone app, you just get three options &#8211; attach location, take a photo or choose a photo. You then get to choose filters for your photos and you&#8217;re done.

On iPhone, the Twitter app is much wider now, taking up full space. That can be a considerable improvement for readability. Also, the app notifies you when a friend of you joins Twitter (which is confirmed by checking contacts in your E-mail, I guess).

On the other hand, Twitter for Android now takes full advantage of Android&#8217;s powerful notifications system and groups multiple notifications into one. You get to see user&#8217;s display picture in the notification itself and they are expandable too.

Both the app updates are available now. Go, update, and enjoy.
