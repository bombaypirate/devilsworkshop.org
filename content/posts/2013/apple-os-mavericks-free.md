Yesterday&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s media event was pretty awesome. They unveiled the new iPad Air, Mac Pro, MacBook Pros and lot more.

There was one thing which wasn&#8217;t expected though &#8211; giving away Mavericks for free. On the same day.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-78313" alt="OS X Mavericks installation" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/10/mav-600x446.jpg" width="600" height="446" />][1]

Mavericks is the first release of OS X breaking away from the cat family names. Apple has removed linen everywhere and has replaced with a solid colour &#8211; making it inline with iOS 7 style.

We already talked about the features before, the ones that stand out are Finder tabs/tags, better memory compression, longer battery life, iBooks and so on.

The update is available for all the devices which are running OS X Mountain Lion.

Updating is simple, just open the App Store app and download Mavericks. It&#8217;s a huge update &#8211; 5.29 GB. The worst part is that, it might actually throw an error in middle and you have to start from scratch again.

My OS X download failed over 4 times, and after a few tries it worked finally. This is because of excess load on Apple&#8217;s servers and there&#8217;s hardly anything we can do about it.

One small tip though, is that, if the App Store app throws an error saying &#8216;Download has failed&#8217; or anything like that &#8211; open Finder, go to /Applications and look for **OS X Mavericks.appdownload**. If it exists, launch it. The download should now resume.
