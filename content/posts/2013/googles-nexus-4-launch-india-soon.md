Google&#8217;s Nexus 4 mobile phone device was launched almost 4 months ago in the US but as yet there is no real news for a India launch. But that might change very soon and Nexus 4 availability *(officially)*seem imminent in India*. *The <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/4/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/nexus/4/', 'landing page for Nexus 4 on Google']);" >landing page for Nexus 4 on Google</a>, shows India added in the list of countries it should be available.

### Why the launch is imminent?

  * Nexus 4&#8217;s launch in India was being held up probably to wait for the announcement of LG&#8217;s Optimus G. As LG also manufactures Nexus 4, it probably did not want Nexus 4 to overshadow the Optimus G.
  * Pricing issues are also a bit of a stumbling block. LG&#8217;s Optimus G goes for around Rs. 31,000. Nexus 4 goes for $299 for the 8 GB mobel. That is approximately Rs. 16,000. If Nexus 4 is released in India, expect it to be priced around the Optimus G price range.
  * With Samsung Galaxy S IV unveiling only days away, it might give LG a nice buzz around March 15 in India, to crash Samsung&#8217;s party, atleast in India.

### India needs a Nexus Phone!

India is fast turning over from being a country that loved its Blackberry and Nokia to a country that has safely adopted the Android platform. Android phones are outselling other phones in the smart-phone market but it is still a country does not have a Nexus phone available officially. The [stock Android experience][1] is something, Google should make easily available than it is in India at the moment.
