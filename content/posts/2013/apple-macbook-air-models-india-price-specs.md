The price of the new MacBook Air are actually a bit lesser than last year&#8217;s pricing. That is very surprising considering the US Dollar to Indian Rupee ratio is at an all time high. Though it might also mean that there are simply a lot more MacBooks being sold in India.

Looking at the pricing, it makes very little sense to buy a 11-inch MacBook Air with 256 GB storage as it is the same price as that 13-inch MacBook Air, albeit with half the memory storage size.

The new MacBook Air will also get the [OS X Mavericks update][1] later in the year.

Do drop in your comments.
