This just in &#8211; Apple has confirmed that the WWDC keynote will be live streamed for all Apple devices including Macs, iPhones/iPods, iPads, and Apple TVs &#8211; via Apple&#8217;s website.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75371" alt="Apple Events" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-10-at-6.06.40-PM-600x375.gif" width="600" height="375" />][1]

Apple did the same thing for last year&#8217;s WWDC, i.e. live streaming only for Apple devices, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll get an alternate stream some where.

But in case you have an Apple device, make sure it runs Safari 4 or later and you&#8217;re good to go.

The event is set to start at 10AM PDT, which turns out to be 10:30 PM IST (in case you&#8217;re living in India). You can <a href="http://everytimezone.com/#2013-6-10,300,6bj" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://everytimezone.com/#2013-6-10,300,6bj', 'use this little tool']);" >use this little tool</a> to get a quick idea on when the keynote starts.

Rumors have it that Apple is going to release iOS 7 and OS X 10.9, both of them showcasing flat UI. But no one really knows &#8211; which is the reason why there&#8217;s a lot of suspense for this year&#8217;s WWDC.

So, make sure you tune into this event via the official stream (via website), or an alternate stream, if you don&#8217;t have an Apple device lying near you.
