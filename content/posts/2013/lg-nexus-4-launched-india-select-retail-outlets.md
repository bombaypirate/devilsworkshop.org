LG&#8217;s Nexus 4 has been awaited for a long time to come. It finally showed up a couple of days ago on Flipkart for pre-order but the launch was not officially confirmed. LG has confirmed declaring the phone is being launched in India at the price tag of **Rs. 25,999**. The phone will be available at select retail stores of LG and multi-brand retailers. It is already available for pre-order with online vendors.

The phone will ship with 4.7 inch screen, 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 Processor, the resolution supported is 1280 X 786 pixel. The runs on stock Android 4.2.2. The phone will ship with a 8MP camera with the front-facing camera being 1.3MP HD.

### So should you buy a Nexus 4 phone?

Firstly, the phone gives its users the pure Android experience. This means the manufacturer does not put their own software on it. That is one of the biggest selling points of a Nexus phone.

Secondly, the phone is priced very reasonably. Most high-end smartphones are priced over Rs. 30,000. The Samsung Galaxys S4 *(though much more powerful than Nexus 4)* is priced at Rs. **41,500**. So the price tag of Rs. **25,999** seems attractive.**  
**

Finally, your phone will get the latest Android updates available straight away. You will not be dependent on the manufacturer getting the updates through to your phone. For instance if tomorrow Android 4.3 is released, it will be available for your phone immediately.

The one issue I find with Nexus 4 is its glass back cover protecting the battery. This tends to make it fragile. The best way to avoid it is to buy a cover for your phone.
