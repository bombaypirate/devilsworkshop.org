Apple has got one more event left for their fans, before the year ends. Few months back, they&#8217;ve released their most &#8216;future-proof&#8217; phone yet and it has apparently been sold in scores.

This time, it&#8217;s the turn of iPads, Mac Pro, OS X Mavericks and probably even MacBook Pros.

The report comes from John Paczkowski of AllThingsD, and as he writes, Apple is going to release updates for a lot of products in this event.

iPads of course, will take the centre stage and Apple will make way for iPad 5 and iPad mini 2. Apple supposedly will bring the 64-bit A7 chip and fingerprint sensor to the iPad 5, and a more slimmer design.

For the Mac enthusiasts, there&#8217;s quite a lot of stuff to get excited. Mac Pro, the most powerful, extensible Mac of all time will be released. It should be interesting to see how the sales will be.

I&#8217;m genuinely excited about OS X Mavericks. It&#8217;ll bring Finder tabs/tags, better battery life, a more faster OS X and lot more small stuff.

Finally, they must be releasing MacBook Pros with haswell processors &#8211; which means a huge bump in battery life.

All these are just predictions, though. Apple might just release a crazy new product which no one ever expected. But that&#8217;s not the typical Apple.
