There have been rumors in the past few days regarding Google releasing a totally revamped Gmail app for Android and also a new categorisation feature for Gmail web. As it turns out, the rumors are indeed true.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74800" alt="Gmail on desktop" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/desktop-600x126.png" width="600" height="126" />][1]

Gmail can now automatically categorise the incoming mail into tabs like &#8216;Social&#8217;, &#8216;Promotion&#8217;, &#8216;Updates&#8217; etc. allowing you to quickly switch between different kinds of E-mail.

Even if the categorisation is done wrong, you can always drag and drop messages into a certain category or even set a specific sender&#8217;s mails to fall into a category. You can of course totally switch off this feature and get back to old style Inbox.

For me, the most exciting thing is the new Android app, which ideally should have been released at I/O. The new Gmail app is redesigned, taking a lot of inspiration from Gmail for iPhone.

It also sticks to Android&#8217;s new design guidelines which recommend a navigation drawer.

Here&#8217;s a promo video by Google.



Both the Android and iPhone apps, along with the new Gmail Inbox (on web) will be released in the coming weeks. So stay tuned!
