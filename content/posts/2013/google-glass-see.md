Google has announced that it will start opening up Google Glass to public in a limited manner. People can start applying for Google Glass by declaring what they would do with Google Glass on Google+ or Twitter. It has to be the hashtag #ifihadglass.

The initial price tag for participants is $1500 US.Â But how will Google Glass work? Will the display screen on the side actually be a distraction or will it be something that adds to the experience.

Now with this video it shows more or less what someone wearing Google Glass will see.

I am excited about Google Glass. It is truly something that makes technology extremely personal. With products like Gmail, Google Maps, Android, Google+, Google Drive and Search, Google is uniquely positioned to deliver a product like Google Glass and make it work.
