Kim Dotcom the man behind the file sharing website Megaupload.com has launched a new file-sharing and cloud storage serivce called Mega. ***Megaupload.com*** was an extremely popular file sharing website got itself into trouble when its founder Kim Dotcom was charged in New Zealand for copyright infringement. Exactly one year after Megaupload was shutdown, Kim Dotcom launched the a new service <a href="https://mega.co.nz/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://mega.co.nz/', 'Mega']);" ><strong>Mega</strong></a>.

Mega apparently is not Megaupload relaunched but apparently &#8216;a completely new service&#8217;. It is interesting to see the nuanced term &#8220;cloud storage&#8221; being emphasized more than the term &#8220;file sharing&#8221; on Mega.

### What does Mega offer?

  * Mega cloud storage offers upto 50GB free storage space.
  * The bandwidth is limited and it seems like a file size of greater than 100MB for download is allowed only on Pro accounts. This I guess is to discourage Mega users from using it for uploading pirated movies.
  * Mega also offers cloud storing service which are paid accounts. These Pro packages are for 500GB, 2 TB and 4 TB storage space respectively. The bandwidth also is significantly higher than in the free account.

With 50 GB free storage space, it is many more times more than any other cloud service offering. Dropbox offers 2 GB, Google Drive 5 GB and SkyDrive 7GB with their free packages. But Mega has no mobile phone support while all other cloud services have apps across all major mobile platforms.

But compared to Microsoft, Google and Dropbox, Mega will be a lot less trusted brand. This is more so after Megaupload was closed down.
