I have always liked reading through newspaper headlines mostly of English and Marathi daily newspapers. Now, I hardly read actual newspapers and end up using Google News and other select feeds. But this reliance on Google has ended up me missing out on skimming through news in Marathi language which is my mother tongue.

We can use [ePaperGallery which has some newspaper feeds from older newspapers][1], but I preferred a mobile friendly service. NewsHunt seemed to be a great website for News junkies.<figure style="width: 567px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

### NewsHunt Features

  * The website can be accessed as a mobile website. Just head over to <a href="http://m.newshunt.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://m.newshunt.com', 'm.newshunt.com']);" >m.newshunt.com</a> and a mobile friendly website allows looking through news taken from various sources in India. The service supports many languages like Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil and more.
  * There is a free app released on Android, iPhone/iPad, BlackBerry and even the Nokia Ovi store.
  * NewsHunt does not at the moment support Windows phone which. They will have to use the browser.

If you want to save money on buying a newspaper but still catch the articles, this app seems to be a perfect fit.

Do try out NewsHunt and drop in your comments.
