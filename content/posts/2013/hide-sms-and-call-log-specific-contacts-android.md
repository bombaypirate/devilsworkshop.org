This post is for those folks who want to hide their text messages and call details from certain numbers on their phones. We can do this on Android by locking your phone with a password or drawing a pattern. But what if you want to hide call logs and text messages from certain specific contacts? This is where Shady Contacts app ends up being helpful.

  * The app allows you to hide text messages and call logs from particular phone numbers.
  * The Shady Contacts app basically hides text messages and call logs from the stock app of your phone. You can save it using pattern as a password.
  * It also has the additional option of auto-deleting all the data if you get the pattern wrong a certain set number of times.
  * Users can protect this data based on contacts and also set up customized notifications.

I personally did not find any real use of this app as I do not know any shady contacts.

But I found out that the app settings allows you to hide all messages and calls logs from numbers that are not saved on my phone. That actually removes a lot of the clutter from my phone&#8217;s inbox.

Do try out Shady Contacts and drop in your comments.
