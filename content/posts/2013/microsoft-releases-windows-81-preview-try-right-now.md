Microsoft has released the next version of Windows 8 yesterday, at the Build conference. It has [everything you&#8217;d expect][1]Â from an incremental update, including a start button, redesigned Store, Search, better customization and more.

For me, the best part of it is that, you can give Windows 8.1 Preview a try right now &#8211; without being a developer (unlike OS X Mavericks, for example).

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-75944" alt="Windows 8.1 Preview" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-27-at-9.49.25-AM-600x336.gif" width="600" height="336" />][2]

To get started, you first need to be running Windows 8. That&#8217;s because Windows 8.1 installation will be done via the Windows Store seamlessly. You can do it manually too, ISO files will be available pretty soon, keeping <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/download-preview" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/download-preview', 'checking the download page']);" >checking the download page</a> on the site. The update is free, of course.

The size of update is 2.44 GB which is probably not so huge, if you have a good internet connection. Otherwise, you&#8217;re going to wait. There&#8217;s also no guarantee that the OS is going to be stable, as it is clearly named as a &#8216;Preview&#8217;. So make sure you backup your important files and all before proceeding.

Here&#8217;s a nice promo video made by Microsoft for previewing the OS.



Do these updates actually make Windows 8 better? Will you be trying out the Preview? Do comment below.
