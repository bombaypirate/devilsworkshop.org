Since it&#8217;s launch, Twitter has always put a restriction on who can Direct Message (DM) whom (for example, you can DM me only if I follow you) But, starting today, this is about to change. Twitter has brought a new feature, that lets the users to receive DMs from any user, even from accounts that they do not follow.

This is an opt-in feature that you can enable in the *Settings* page of your Twitter account.

To enable this feature, check the box &#8220;*Receive direct message from any follow*&#8221;

It hasn&#8217;t been announced officially by Twitter yet. But many Twitter users have already noticed this new feature on their accounts. @JimConnolly was one of the first users to <a href="https://twitter.com/JimConnolly/statuses/389992604114243584" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/JimConnolly/statuses/389992604114243584', 'notice this']);" title="JimConnolly on Twitter">notice this</a>.<figure id="attachment_78163" style="width: 513px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

This might be useful for brands to get people who post complaints to send them details in a more private manner. But I think that this might lead to a surge of spam messages landing on my inbox from unknown users. But, also, in such a case, I can always go back to the *Settings* page and disable it. Nevertheless, this option will definitely means more spam but also a lot of advertising.

Since Twitter has filed an IPO and will be under pressure to generate revenues we can expect more such intrusive features to pay for Twitter. Though I expect Twitter have some sort of filter to ensure DMs from people you followed can be looked up exclusively.
