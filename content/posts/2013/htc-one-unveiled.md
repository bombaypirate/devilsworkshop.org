HTC along with Samsung is known for being a shining light of the Android world of phones. Though it has not done as well as Samsung and in reality it is a struggling company. So with their latest announcement of HTC One, they will be hoping to put a bigger ding in the smart-phone market than they have previously.

So lets take a look at HTC One which was unveiled yesterday.

### HTC One: Features and Specs

  * HTC One will have a 4.7 inch 1080p Super LCD 3 display.
  * The phone itself will run on the Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) platform along with HTC Sense 5.
  * The phone is incredibly thin at 9.3mm. Its length and breath are 139.4 mm and 68.2 mm respectively.
  * The phone packs a RAM of 2GB DDR2 and internal storage memory is in two variants. They are 32 GB and 64 GB.
  * The phone will require a microSIM and connects over WiFi, 2G,3G and supports LTE in certain countries.
  * It also has a 4 MP sensor with UltraPixel Camera.
  * The phone is designed a bit differently than its predecessors and it sports a aluminium body (*iPhone inspiration?*)

### So what&#8217;s different?

Outwardly the biggest difference for me (I use a lower end HTC One V phone) is the absence of a home button. It has been replaced with the HTC logo.

It will also feature something called HTC BlinkFeed which will allow users to pick and chose feeds from various social networks, news and feeds. It looks like HTC&#8217;s own version of Flipboard.

As far as my personal preferences go, I am not exactly sold on Sense and agree with the idea that [stock Android versions are better][2]. Otherwise the phone looks great and should perform well.

The phone should be available in the month of March. The pricing will be interesting to see as by then Samsung will be cranking up its machine to make sure Galaxy S IV flood dominate the market.
