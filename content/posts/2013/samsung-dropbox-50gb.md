These are not just their flagship phones like Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 2 but also on Galaxy Camera. Additionally it will also be made available to their new range of smart TVs.

Samsung phones are already carrying the Dropbox app as an native app. But it will push photos taken to be saved on Dropbox pro-actively. Also when users activate the Dropbox account on their Samsung device, they will be given 50 GB storage space free for a period of 2 years.

### Why Samsung likes Dropbox and not Google Drive?

Considering Samsung&#8217;s flagship phones are running Android OS, one would expect them to show more loyalty to Google Drive instead of Dropbox. The problem for Samsung is that it feels to dependent on the Android ecosystem and by extension Google. It is a bit like how Nokia is dependent on Microsoft.

It also makes sense for Dropbox which is flourishing at the moment but is facing some very tough competition from the likes of Google Drive, SkyDrive and iCloud.

Another consideration fro Samsung would be that its own competitors on the Android platform like HTC are offering 25 GB free space on phone activation.

If you are a fan of Android and Dropbox, buying a Samsung phone might sound like a sweet deal.
