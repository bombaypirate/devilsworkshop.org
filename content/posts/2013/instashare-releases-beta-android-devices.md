I&#8217;ve [reviewed Instashare previously][1], it&#8217;s an incredibly simple way for sharing files between iOS and Mac. And now, it&#8217;s time for Android.

Sharing files between devices &#8211; it&#8217;s a really simple and obvious thing which many of us do regularly. Yet it&#8217;s unnecessarily complex. There are many apps which fall in this category &#8211; Bump is a good example. But it needs a working internet connection and takes a lot of time for transferring big files.

Then there&#8217;s NFC, much simpler way to share files, although pretty limited considering that many phones of today don&#8217;t have it. Also, laptops/desktops obviously don&#8217;t have it. At last, there&#8217;s Bluetooth, it&#8217;s reliable and cross platform, excepting iOS devices.

Even Apple released AirDrop for iOS, at WWDC, but it&#8217;s pretty limited.

Instashare doesn&#8217;t have the problems you face while using Bump, or NFC, or Bluetooth. First, it&#8217;s really simple. You open the app on your phone, drag and drop a file and done. Secondly, it works via WiFi and Bluetooth &#8211; even on iPhones and iPads.

The Android app is pretty self explanatory, you just have to select Instashare in Android&#8217;s share intents menu and the file will then be visible in the app, ready to share with other devices.

There&#8217;s no limit what so ever, on file size or type. A Windows app is also on its way.

The app isn&#8217;t yet released on Play store, it&#8217;s in beta and <a href="https://testflightapp.com/join/8a9c55e049e76bbeaac201de84079075-NTEx/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://testflightapp.com/join/8a9c55e049e76bbeaac201de84079075-NTEx/', 'you can request access for it']);" >you can request access for it</a>.
