Have you noticed a small, white and blue check mark symbol on some popular Facebook pages recently? If not, head to the official Facebook page of Barack Obama, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez or any other popular celebrity. You will notice a small white and blue check mark symbol indicating that they are verified pages.

Yesterday, Facebook rolled out these special verified badges would show up on popular profiles and pages. This move is to prove that those profiles are the original ones and not a fake ones. Just like Twitter&#8217;s policies and now Google+, these Facebook verified badges won&#8217;t be given to any normal Facebook user.

At the moment this feature seems to be only available to US based users.

But the recent updates show that, Facebook people with a relatively large subscriber base seem to get verified.

It is good that Facebook is adding verified symbols to very popular profiles and pages. This has clearly helped resolve confusion over fake and real profiles on Twitter so it should be helpful similarly on Facebook.

Do you think Facebook is trying to hard to become like Twitter? Do drop in your comments.
