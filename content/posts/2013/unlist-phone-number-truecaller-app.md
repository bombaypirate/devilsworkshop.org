Websites like <a href="http://www.truecaller.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.truecaller.com/', 'TrueCaller ']);" >TrueCaller </a>easilyÂ allow people to lookup the name of the person to whom a phone number belongs to. It behaves mainly like a global directory. Truecaller itself has some useful apps too on Android and iPhone. The android app actually displays the name of person if the phone number that you are receiving a call from is not saved in your contacts.

But what if you do not want Truecaller to list your phone number? In the interest of privacy, Truecaller has an option to unlist your phone number.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/TrueCaller-Unlist.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-74768" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="TrueCaller Unlist" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/05/TrueCaller-Unlist-600x385.png" width="600" height="385" /></a>
</p>

**How it works:**

  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Visit <a href="http://www.truecaller.com/unlist/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.truecaller.com/unlist/', 'Truecaller&#8217;s unlist page']);" >Truecaller&#8217;s unlist page</a> and type in your details.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Enter the right captcha and your phone number becomes unlisted.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">I was surprised that it did not send a confirmation code or something on the phone but then it makes sense. If it does not ask permission before listing them, they do not need to unlist them either.</span>

Though unlisting your number is useful for privacy, TrueCaller can be very useful to get notified of numbers which give you those spammy marketing calls which you wished, you had not answered.
