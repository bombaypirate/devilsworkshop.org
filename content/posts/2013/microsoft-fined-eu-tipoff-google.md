The fine was imposed because Microsoft did not respect an agreement to give users who are using Windows a clear option to choose from various browser.

Microsoft was supposed to display a pop-up screen that showed users the option to choose between different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer.

Apparently in February 2011, Windows 7 Service Pack 1 was rolled out and the screen disappeared. EU authorities did not investigate the matter immediately and according to a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/07/google-tipped-off-eu-authorities-over-microsofts-browser-boo-boo-report-claims/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gigaom.com/2013/03/07/google-tipped-off-eu-authorities-over-microsofts-browser-boo-boo-report-claims/', 'report in GigaOm']);" >report in GigaOm</a>, Google and Opera tipped of EU about it.

### Google and Microsoft bitter fighting!

Google and Microsoft are fighting against each other for a long time. [Google had once accused Bing of copying results][2] from Google Search. Microsoft has not been playing nice either. Their negative ads against Google &#8211; [almost blaming them for the US financial collapse][3] and recently a [new campaign called BingitOn][4] that was supposed to comparative differences between Google and Bing.

Google maybe playing a little negative here but what was Microsoft trying to do here! It is not the first it has been fined by the EU authorities. An anti-trust case in 2004 ended up in EU setting a fine of $794 Million against Microsoft for the same mischief regarding browser choices.(*<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Microsoft_competition_case" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Microsoft_competition_case', 'related Wikipedia article']);" >related Wikipedia article</a>*).

Google also has good reason to see Microsoft playing fair, as it does impact Chrome negatively. Most growth seen by Chrome has been at the cost of Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer.
