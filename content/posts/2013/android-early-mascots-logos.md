Android&#8217;s robotic logo is now famous. It looks friendly and cheerful, which although is a very difficult thing to do with a logo. That the current logo of Android could have been very different. Dan Morrill who works in Google&#8217;s Android Engineering team shared some of the early proposed logos for Android.

These proposed robotic logos nicknamed in Google as &#8216;Dandroids&#8217; were shared by <a href="https://plus.google.com/112413860260589530492/posts/WrBh6fsChfH" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/112413860260589530492/posts/WrBh6fsChfH', 'Dan Morrill on Google+']);" >Dan Morrill on Google+</a>.

One could hardly blame Dan Morrill for designing slightly scary looking robots as a logo as he is not a designer. He is an engineer and it is expected that his design ideas might at best beÂ amateurish.

It would be one really hideous looking mascot if Google actually had not chosen a professional designer&#8217;s ideas which gave us the current mascot.

Thankfully better sense prevailed and Google has a much nicer, friendly looking Android logo <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .
