He will be replaced by Sundar Pichai. This is a big change at Google but Andy Rubin is not quitting he is moving to other Google projects.

Sundar Pichai seems a natural choice as he heads the Chrome team. He has been very successful with the rise of Chrome browser and also tending to a very good developer ecosystem that keeps Chrome&#8217;s web store healthy with apps and extensions.

Now he takes over running of the Android project for Google.

There were also additional announcements of some major landmarks reached by Android.

  * Android has now been activated on over 750 million devices.
  * 25 billion apps have been now downloaded on Google Play.
  * They also announced 60 manufacturers have a partnership with Android.<figure id="attachment_72198" style="width: 270px;" class="wp-caption alignright">

### Andy Rubin&#8217;s Future

Andy Rubin is a legendary name in the mobile industry. He was the co-founder of Android Inc, the company that started the open-source OS. Google finally ended up buying Android but let Andy Rubin head the project. Andy Rubin has not just led [Android from iPhone&#8217;s shadow][3] but also made it into the arguably the best mobile OS with a big app ecosystem.

Andy Rubin is moving to other Google projects. Is it Google Glass? We will not know for a while atleast.

### Future of Android!

With someone who headed the Chrome team now also in charge of Android, it is quite possible to expect a lot more integration of the two platforms.

Both have a healthy developer ecosystem but they are for the most part running parallel except for [Chrome recently being available on Android][4] and other mobile OS. Hopefully their paths will cross a lot more now.
