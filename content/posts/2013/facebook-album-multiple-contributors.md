Facebook today has rolled out a new feature called Shared Album. It allows users to allow other users to add photos in their albums.

Try opening an album on your Facebook account and you will receive a new notification that allows &#8220;Shared Album&#8221;.<figure id="attachment_77371" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Clicking on edit options, users can easily add their friends to Shared Album list. This will allow added users to also add new users as contributors to the album.

Each contributor to the album has a limit of 200 photos they can upload to a single album.

Currently, this option is available only with personal profiles and does not work with albums uploaded by Facebook pages. That will probably soon change.

This feature is a good addition and it will probably end up being used a lot by people celebrating birthdays or going on vacations with their friends. It might make life difficult for services which were already into the niche of allowing [multiple contributors to share their photos in a single stream like LiveShare][3].

**Recommended Tips for Shared Album**

Adding contributors to an album could be a great way to crowd source photos of a single event or vacation with friends at a single place. But remember to keep an eye on Privacy settings of the album. If the Album is Public, these photos your friends add will also be publicly available.

Also to control who contributes we can also deselect the option of allowing contributors to add their friends as contributors.
