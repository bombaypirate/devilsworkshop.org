Mac software is generally pricey, especially for Windows converts like me. Thankfully, there are app bundles which let you buy software at bulk and get discount. Sometimes you can get lucky and could get an app bundle totally for free &#8211; which is exactly what StackSocial is offering.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70626" alt="stack-social-mac-app-bundle" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2013/01/StackSocial-2.png" width="1040" height="509" />][1]

StackSocial is popular for giving discounts on software and they have just released &#8216;The Mac Freebie Bundle&#8217; which essentially gives you 8 paid Mac apps for free.

The apps list include IconBox, Ondesoft Screen Capture, VidConvert, Image Smith, Wallpaper Wizard, ClipBuddy, TypeFu and Sweetie. As you may have guessed, it&#8217;s mostly productivity software and can be really useful.

Of all the apps listed, I already use Wallpaper Wizard (got it from another Mac bundle) and really love it. It lets you change your desktop&#8217;s wallpaper automatically from a curated list of wallpapers.

Even if you aren&#8217;t much of a productivity guy, nothing hurts from grabbing a bunch of paid apps for free. The offer will last for 15 days, the site looks slow from here, probably because of heavy traffic. You just have to register for the site, share on your social network and you&#8217;ll gain access to the apps.
