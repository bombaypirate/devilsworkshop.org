Google Takeout is a service that allows you to [archive all your data stored on a particular service offered by Google][1]. For example it allows you to download all your Picassa, contacts, documents on Google Drive, list of feeds on Google Reader and more. Now it has added Google+ Pages and Blogger (blogspot) as services whose data can be archived or downloaded and stored locally.

### How to Download Google+ and Blogger Hosted Blog

  * Sign-in to your Google account which you want to use to download and archive data from.
  * Then look up the <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/takeout/', 'Google Takeout']);" >Google Takeout</a> landing page and click on ***Choose services***.
  * Select Blogger and Pages from the list and click on ***Create Archive***.
  * A ***.zip*** file can be downloaded which contains your archive in ***.ATOM*** format files.

I have found ***Google Takeout*** very useful in the past to [transfer my Google+ circles and followers from one account to another][2].
