Samsung has confirmed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile/status/305951457134383104/photo/1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile/status/305951457134383104/photo/1', 'tweet']);" >tweet</a> that there is a &#8220;unpacked&#8221; event in New York City on **March 14**. The event will be where Samsung will unveil **Galaxy S IV**. Samsung has had a fantastic year in 2012, with record sales for Galaxy S III handset. It is almost certain that Galaxy S IV will be sold in very large numbers.

Samsung has had difficulty selling its Galaxy S I and S II handsets with patent filings against it by Apple. Thought S III was a different story and with S IV launch in New York, it is obviously trying to make a big splash in the United States.

### Expectations from Galaxy S IV

There have been rumours that Samsung will be stepping away from Android in favour of its own Tizen. Though, it seems very unlikely that Galaxy S IV will have Tizen. It will most probably ship with Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean.

Earlier in the year, [Samsung showcased flexible OLED screens][1]. They might make an appearance with Galaxy S IV versions. I think it might be fair to expect a screen that folds over the edge, which could be useful to display notifications. It will most probably have a 5-inch display screen.

Samsung Galaxy S IV will end up competing with the likes of [HTC One][2], Nokia&#8217;s Lumia 920, possibly an iPhone 6 (*or iPhone 5S*) and [BlackBerry 10][3] for top honours in the smart phone industry. If Samsung keeps doing as well has it has in the past year, it could probably mean very difficult days for HTC, Nokia and BlackBerry.
