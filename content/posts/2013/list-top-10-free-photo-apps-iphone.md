If you own a iPhone, then you are probably taking a lot of photos. While iPhone does have its built-in features for managing and editing photos, a lot of us like to use apps. Here is a list of free photo editing and management apps for your iPhone.

### #1. Pixlr-o-matic<figure id="attachment_69364" style="width: 288px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/analysis/list-top-10-free-photo-apps-iphone/69363/attachment/pixlr-o-matic/" rel="attachment wp-att-69364"><img class="size-full wp-image-69364 " title="Pixlr-o-matic" alt="Pixlr-o-matic" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/12/Pixlr-o-matic.jpg" width="288" height="512" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pixlr-o-matic</figcaption></figure> 

This app lets you transform your photos by applying cool retro effects to them. ***Pixlr-o-matic*** offers a wealth of filters and lighting options in a strip along the bottom as well as a selection of borders. You can either take photos using your device’s camera, or apply the effects to an existing image.

Microsoft’s ***Photosynth app for iPhone*** (oddly, it’s not available for Windows Phone 7) lets you create seamless, 360-degree panoramas from multiple photos. Just press ‘start’ and rotate slowly on the spot to capture and stitch together a series of shots. You can add your panoramas to Bing Maps and explore other users’ efforts.
