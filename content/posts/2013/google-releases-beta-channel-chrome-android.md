While it has been almost an year since the [release of Chrome for Android][1], Google hasn&#8217;t updated it much and there&#8217;s lot of scope for improvement. Hopefully, that won&#8217;t be the case any more as Google has released Chrome Beta for Android.

This is a big thing considering Google is trying to bring Chrome for Android inline with the desktop version of Chrome. I&#8217;ve tried the beta channel on my Galaxy Nexus and it wasn&#8217;t a smooth experience at all. But again, this is the beta channel, so finding bugs is actually the essence of it.

The <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.in/2013/01/chrome-for-android-beta-channel.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.in/2013/01/chrome-for-android-beta-channel.html', 'official Chrome releases Blog']);" >official Chrome releases Blog</a> itself points out that &#8220;Performance is sluggish, noticeably on Galaxy Nexus and Nexus S&#8221; &#8211; which is actually the case even with stable channel. So let&#8217;s see how fast they&#8217;ll fix it.

You can run both the stable and beta builds of Chrome side by side and can even make the beta build as your default browser (which you might not want to do).

Just like the stable build, Chrome Beta is only available for Android devices running 4.0 and up.

You won&#8217;t see the app in Playstore search, so if you want to try it, you need to have the link &#8211; which is right below.
