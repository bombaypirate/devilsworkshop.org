Last week I was discussing issues of how bloggers are not aware of copyright laws or copyright symbols. Though most bloggers learn about copyright issues well after they start blogging but well before they start making money from blogging.

I know a lot of young bloggers in their teens who copy-paste content from other sides on first website they put up. This is done very often done harmlessly and without realization that they might be actually doing something illegal copyright wise.

As bloggers learn more, people learn about various licenses. Creative Commons is on such licence which has been embraced by the online community to share information freely.

But everything with the CC licence symbol is not something that can be used without giving credit to the author. Creative Commons is used often in combination of Attribution (BY), ShareAlike (SA), NoDerivs (ND) and Non Commercial (NC).

I came <a href="http://techfleece.com/2012/02/22/what-are-the-different-creative-commons-licences-what-do-they-mean/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techfleece.com/2012/02/22/what-are-the-different-creative-commons-licences-what-do-they-mean/', 'across a nice infographic']);" >across a nice infographic</a> that explains how you can use Creative Commons licenced content. It was created by Milos Janata.

### My Tip:

If you are wondering if you should credit the author/creator of some content, then you should be asking yourself why would you not want to give credit. Even if it was not legally required, it is ethically required in my opinion.

Do drop in your comments if you have any more simplified way for explaining copyright licences.
