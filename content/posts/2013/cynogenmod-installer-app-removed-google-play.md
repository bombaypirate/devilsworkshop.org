All users needed was a rooted Android device. About three weeks ago, CyanogenMod introduced its CyanogenMod installer app on the play store. This was a sign that CyanogenMod or CM as its known, was now friendly enough to be installed by Android users who were not really technical adept at installing ROMs.

The party came crashing today with CyanogenMod having to voluntarily remove it&#8217;s installer app from the Google Play store.

The reason from removing the app in <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cyanogenmod-installer-application-removed-from-play-store" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cyanogenmod-installer-application-removed-from-play-store', 'CyanogenMod&#8217;s blog post']);" >CyanogenMod&#8217;s blog post</a> was that the app encouraged users to void their warranty. This was against Google Play guidelines that would have basically meant the app would have been kicked out at some point of time, if it had not been removed voluntarily.

### Google will get bad press, but it is right!

Google for this action will soon be called evil and I am sure many thousands of words will be written about how this indicates that the Android ecosystem is closed and not open. Google might get bad press but in my opinion it is doing the right thing.

Getting CyanogenMod installed on a phone is not something a newbie does or even explores. Most people who do this through Cyanogenmod.org are actually technically adept at installing 3rd ROMs on their phones. With a Play Store app a newbie could easily install CyanogenMod on his phone without knowing the risks of voiding warranty. Also reverting back from CM is also not easy and that is a very important guideline for any app on Google Play.

CyanogenMod in all probability will fix this with changes in the future.
