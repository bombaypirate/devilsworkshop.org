Google has announced a new feature for app and website developers. It is called Google+ sign-in, which allows users to sign-up/register with apps and websites. This is possibly the first big step towards seeing a lot more of Google+ outside the Google ecosystem. In other words, it will compete with Facebook Connect.

### What exactly is Google+ Sign-in about

Google authentication is already a feature that is used by many websites. But a lot of them prefer using Facebook, mainly because it helps the app get social.

With Google+ Sign-in, the app user can share stuff based on their Google+ Circles. This can be done through interactive labels like Check-in, Subscribe, Download and many more.

Google+ also suggests that they are against social spamming. Basically that is taking a swipe at Facebook. Facebook&#8217;s friction-less sharing from apps was a unpopular idea.

Google is in much better position to leverage Google+ Sign-in compared to Facebook connect because it has its own mobile platform, search engine, email service, maps and Google Play, a store for apps.
