Recently I came across this new search tool, that allowed me to search for related links from a list of custom selected websites. The new service called <a href="http://www.goasterisk.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.goasterisk.com/', 'Asterisk Search']);" >Asterisk Search</a> works as a plugin on Firefox and Chrome. While visiting a webpage, if you want more related information, we just have to select the text and click on the Asterisk symbol.

### Features of Asterisk Search

  * Install the <a href="http://www.goasterisk.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.goasterisk.com/', 'GoAsterisk']);" >GoAsterisk</a> pluging for your browser. It supports Firefox and Chrome at the moment.
  * Highlight text from the webpage you are reading. A small asterisk symbol will show up.
  * Click on it and some results will show up on the left-hand column. There are some popular sites already added like Wikipedia as sources.
  * I could remove these sits and add and customize the sources as I wished. So next time I am reading something, I can simply search from the sites I want to look up rather than all of them.

The only downside of Asterisk is you need to register before you use their service. But you can easily sign-in with your Twitter, Facebook or Google accounts.
