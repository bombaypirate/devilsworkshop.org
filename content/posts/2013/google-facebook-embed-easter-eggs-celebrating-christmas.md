Google is well known for embedding easter eggs on their search results page. Last year whenever someone [typed a reference to Christmas, a small streamer like design showed on the results page][1]. This year the design is much more elegant with snowflakes and even a Santa Claus like figure flying across the header of the results page.

While Google is showing this only for Christmas related queries, Facebook too has introduced its own easter egg in the form of animated snowflakes on its Android app. Just open a chat with someone using &#8220;chat heads&#8221; and we can see snowflakes falling on the profile pic.
