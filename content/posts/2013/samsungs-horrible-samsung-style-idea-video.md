The Galaxy S IV was launched in [50 countries which included India][1]. Now when phones are launched companies try to find the weirdest possible ways to sing praises of its device.

So what did Samsung do?

They hired Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh and made him dance to a song that was a remake *(copy) *of Psy&#8217;s &#8216;Gangnam Style&#8217; music video. The words of the song were &#8220;S for Samsung style&#8221;. The Korean lyrics of the song were further changed into praise filled phrases about Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S IV phone. The song is even more ridiculous than I make it sound.

Below is the full video.



If I was ever going to buy Samsung Galaxy S IV, I think this video would have definitely changed my mind.

Jokes apart, Samsung might be doing great business and also selling millions of phones. But they definitely need to learn that it would be better if their phone did the talking and not some bizarre over the top song and dance show.
