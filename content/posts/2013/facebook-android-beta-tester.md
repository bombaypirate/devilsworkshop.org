Two months ago Facebook launched a new program called *Facebook for Android Beta Testers*. This program allows Android users to test the latest experimental features in the Facebook app. Obviously, this beta edition of Facebook for Android will not be full coded and may cause problems. If you are enthusiastic about helping Facebook build a better app, you should definitely be a part of this program.

Google launched a beta testing program at the Google I/O 2013 conference held on May 2013. With the beta testing program, Android developers can roll-out the updated versions of their apps to a particular group of users, beta testers, to know how those versions perform before rolling out to all the users.

## How to become a beta tester?

Becoming a beta tester is really simple. You&#8217;ll have to join the *Facebook for Android Beta Testers* group on Google Groups, install the beta version of Facebook app and you&#8217;re ready to go.
