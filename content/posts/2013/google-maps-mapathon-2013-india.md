Google has lately taken a big interest in improving their maps for India. Like three months ago, they [introduced traffic updates for Indian cities][1] and before that they had [introduced displaying bus routes][2].

But Google wants more hand-on data and they want volunteers to get more useful data for Google Maps. They have announced that initiative called Mapathon 2013.

### What Google Maps wants?

You can register for **Google&#8217;s Mapathon 2013** contest at <a href="https://www.google.com/mapmaker/mapathon/india2013/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/mapmaker/mapathon/india2013/', 'this landing page']);" >this landing page</a>. Ideally sign in with your Gmail account. The contest will run from Feb 12 to March 25. So you still have 3 days to go ahead and register before it starts.

What Google is trying to do here, is get a lot of Maps users to volunteer important information across India. Google is also offering prizes for the top 1000 contestants.

**Prizes**

  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Prizes on offer include 10 Samsung Galaxy Note 800 Android tablets.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">40 Samsung Galaxy S II phones.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">50 Flipkart gift coupons worth Rs. 5000.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The top 1000 contestants will get an free t-shirt too.</span>

**Chance to do good karma!**

Thought prizes notwithstanding, I think it is a good idea to contribute to Google Maps from time to time. Especially with new information about important places like hospitals, correct names of roads and more.
