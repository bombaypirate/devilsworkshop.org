The idea is simple. Every time a users signs-in there is added code that is asked. That code is sent to users via a text message.

So even if someone manages to guess a password, they would not be able to get the verification code from the users phone.

**How to activate Twitter&#8217;s two-step authentication feature**

  * Visit your Twitter profile on the browser and sign-in. Now on the right-hand corner you will see a gear shaped symbol.
  * Hover over it and it shows you the options to look up settings. Under **Settings >> Account** users can see a new option to titled **Account Security**.

  * We can add a phone number and also select the option to turn-on two step verification.

Here is a nice video demo by Twitter to help their users out
