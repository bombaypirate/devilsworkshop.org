Recently when we decided to switch from Wp Super Cache to W3 Total Cache plugin, we were stuck while translating apache&#8217;s (.htaccess) rewrite rules to nginx configuration.

Now, after some efforts we managed to get nginx working with W3 Total Cache plugin with following rewrite rules.

<pre><code class="no-highlight"># if the requested file exists, return it immediately
if (-f $request_filename) {
	break;
}

## W3 Total CACHE BEGIN
set $totalcache_file '';
set $totalcache_uri $request_uri;

if ($request_method = POST) {
  set $totalcache_uri '';
}

# Using pretty permalinks, so bypass the cache for any query string
if ($query_string) {
  set $totalcache_uri '';
}

if ($http_cookie ~* "comment_author_|wordpress|wp-postpass_" ) {
  set $totalcache_uri '';
}

# if we haven't bypassed the cache, specify our totalcache file
if ($totalcache_uri ~ ^(.+)$) {
  set $totalcache_file /wp-content/w3tc-$http_host/pgcache/$1/_default_.html;
}

# only rewrite to the totalcache file if it actually exists
if (-f $document_root$totalcache_file) {
  rewrite ^(.*)$ $totalcache_file break;
}                 

##W3 Total CACHE END

# all other requests go to WordPress
if (!-e $request_filename) {
	rewrite . /index.php last;
}</code></pre>

Above codes will sit inside **server{ location{ }Â } ** block.

Our original configuration file is too big and contains many unwanted things so I am not publishing it here.

Anyway, if you stuck somewhere, feel free to use commentÂ form below. ðŸ˜‰

***Update:**** For those who are faceing issues with **gzip** (compression)&#8230;*

I have a code block at theÂ beginningÂ of Â location /{} block in our nginx configuration file as below:

<pre><code class="no-highlight">          location / {
               gzip  on;
               gzip_http_version 1.0;
               gzip_vary on;
               gzip_comp_level 3;
               gzip_proxied any;
               gzip_types text/plain text/html text/css application/json application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
               gzip_buffers 16 8k;
               .....
        }</code></pre>

Above code-block basically &#8220;asks&#8221; nginx to turn on compression when files withÂ listed mime types (see line gzip_types) being served

When above lines are present in your configuration, you can altogether disable compression settings from w3 Total Cache as nginx webserver will automatically handle compression for those requests. *Not tested though.*
