There is a song with the words &#8216;I am just a monkey man&#8217;. I am not kidding you, its a fact. The reason I am telling you this is while looking up Google on a friends computer to prove that Rollings Stones actually had a song with the words &#8216;I am a monkey man&#8217; ; inadvertently I came across a very interesting **Chrome extension** called **Quick Scroll**.

### Quick Scroll

  * Download the Google **Quick Scroll** extension to your **Chrome** browser.
  * When you search for a group of words or quote on **Google** you will obviously get search results.
  * Clicking on a link takes you to a page; this is where Quick Scroll extension on Chrome kicks in.
  * As you can see in the image above, on the right hand corner of the web-page I got matches for the exact text I had entered before.

This means that now after I click on a search result, the search keywords are automatically highlighted without me needing to search for text on the browser page. Look at the video below for a demo of how this extension works. If you like it do let me know through your comments.
