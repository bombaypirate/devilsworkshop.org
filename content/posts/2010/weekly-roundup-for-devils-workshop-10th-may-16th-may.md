This week you might have noticed few changes in Devils’ Workshop’s layout. We are experimenting with colors and designs like removing  category box, changing colors etc. to make the homepage more uncluttered and easy to navigate. We are looking forward for your suggestions on new makeover of Devils’ Workshop.
