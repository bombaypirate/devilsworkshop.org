A day after [Google made public][1] that they were under a well organized attack from Chinese hackers news has trickled in that certain Chinese hackers have targeted computers within the Government trying to snare many top level administrators. Apparently an email was sent to top level bureaucrats from a dormant email id. This allowed the hackers the opportunity to access a backdoor within the network for getting access to that computer&#8217;s hard disk.

According to the timing that these attacks coincided with the Copenhagen summit last year, there is a theory that Chinese hackers might have tried to get an idea of India&#8217;s stand before hand. The Prime Minister&#8217;s Office has confirmed about the attack on systems but noted that computers with sensitive material are sanitized and do not have access to the Internet.

### Why China?

A lot of experts are saying China has a long term plan to use its cyber hackers to control the internet or atleast develop the ability to cause great harm. I think that idea is a little over stretched.Â  China does have one of the most comprehensive system of monitoring and censoring content on the internet. It might soon have the highest number of Internet users but the content is very controlled. To acheive this sort of monitoring mechanism would need a huge number of hackers who are working round the clock trying to monitor the massive internet population.

This essentially gives some of these Chinese hackers an ability to be trying their hands at attacking systems and networks outside China. Whereas there is nothing wrong in being aware and vigilant about cyber security, I do not think it is correct to be too carried away with conspiracy theories that will soon start floating on the internet along with some parts of the print and television media.
