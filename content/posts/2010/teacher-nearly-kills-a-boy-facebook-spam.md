In recent some incidents Facebook is highly targeted by spammers like <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/facebook-spam-name-this-is-without-doubt-the-sexiest-video-ever-p-p-p.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shoutmeloud.com/facebook-spam-name-this-is-without-doubt-the-sexiest-video-ever-p-p-p.html', 'sexiest video ever spam']);" >sexiest video ever spam</a> in recent days. These days another spam message saying

&#8220;Teacher nearly kills a 13 year old boy&#8221; or &#8220;See the Shocking video, Teacher nearly kills a boy&#8221; Spam is spreading like viral.  When ever some one click on the video link to see the video, he is redirected to application which ask for permission to allow access to your public information and update your wall.

As stated by <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/06/14/rogue-facebook-app/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mashable.com/2010/06/14/rogue-facebook-app/', 'mashable']);" >mashable</a>

I agree with this thought and Facebook security is becoming a big issue, specially when Facebook subscribers are growing with great number, its high time Facebook should work more on security of Facebook users than Facebook privacy issue.
