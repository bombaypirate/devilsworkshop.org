As a blogger I feel Facebook pages are very important as it allows a blog to share links to its blogs and it is helpful to people who are basically using Facebook more than anything else.

So what is the value of your **Facebook page**? The answer is a little difficult to explain. Mainly every fan of your Facebook Page is a money maker. For a blog it might translate to consistent visits and hence adding up on adsense revenues. ðŸ˜‰

It shows the the value of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FbKnol" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/FbKnol', 'Fbknol&#8217;s Facebook page']);" >Fbknol&#8217;s Facebook page</a> is about $2640 and that is if we calculate each fan worth $5.00. Ofcourse for a blog its difficult to earn $5 through every fan so we can actually increase of decrease the number. This will increase with lets say a Facebook page of a company offering paid services on the internet.
