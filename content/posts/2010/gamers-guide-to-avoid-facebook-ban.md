Do you have a **Facebook** account? Yes. Do you play Facebook **games**? Yes. Do you have a separate account for games? Yes. Caught ya! If you are playing Facebook games especially** Mafia Wars** andÂ  have dedicated an account for it (like me) you may land up in trouble, because Facebook isÂ  disabling all those accounts that haveÂ  been created for game purposes and have no real photographs and details. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a href="http://fbknol.com/gamers-guide-to-avoid-facebook-ban/mafia-wars/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/gamers-guide-to-avoid-facebook-ban/mafia-wars/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2905"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-50407" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/mafia-wars.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a>

According to<a href="http://www.facebook-guides.com/mafia-wars/mafia-wars-facebook-account-banned-zynga/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook-guides.com/mafia-wars/mafia-wars-facebook-account-banned-zynga/', ' facebook-guides.com ']);" > facebook-guides.com </a>in a Skype discussion Zynga representative said that accounts are getting banned from Facebook and Zynga is trying to help such people. Facebook will inspect those accounts which are created just for gaming purposes and include no personal details and photos. If you are like me in that case, there are big chances of us getting banned. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## What to do if you get banned?

Submit a ticket at** Security Center** saying &#8221; I have been banned for Facebook ,help! &#8221; or something like that and you will get a response with a specific escalation URL for Facebook. Use that URL to appeal your ban to Facebook. If your banned is removed great <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> but if not then copy the response you get from Facebook and reply back to the Security Center ticket with the response. Zinga people will then be able to take that information and try to help us. So you need to be extra careful and i will suggest you all to at least make your home page look like you actually use it for networking. ðŸ˜‰

### How to submit a ticket?

  * Go to Account
  * Help center
  * Find &#8216;**security**&#8216; under using Facebook
  * Under My account
  * Click Compromised Account
  * Click **<a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=1023" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=1023', 'here']);" >here</a>** to submit your report
  * You can proceed on clicking whether you can receive mails at your email id or not. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Zynga will track this exchange, appeal on your behalf to Facebook and hopefully restore your account. After all Facebook has included some nice security and <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-games-notifications-gets-a-makeover/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-games-notifications-gets-a-makeover/', 'game updates ']);" >game updates </a>soÂ  you can try to play games from your normal account also. This can be a nice opportunity to try such a thing.
