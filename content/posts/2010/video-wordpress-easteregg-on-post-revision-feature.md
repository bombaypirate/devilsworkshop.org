Post revision is a feature in WordPress which saves the post when you edit it every-time. This feature is very useful, as you can always restore your the post to its old version. This feature can also be used to compare two revision of posts and see the differences between them.

This WordPress Easter-eggs get activated, when you try to compare same post-revisions. See this video to understand how you can see this WordPress easter egg:

**The codes responsible for this easter-egg can be found here:**

<pre><code class="no-highlight">&lt;a href="http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/wp-admin/js/revisions-js.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/wp-admin/js/revisions-js.php', 'http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/wp-admin/js/revisions-js.php']);" >http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/wp-admin/js/revisions-js.php&lt;/a></code></pre>

### How to see it live yourself!
