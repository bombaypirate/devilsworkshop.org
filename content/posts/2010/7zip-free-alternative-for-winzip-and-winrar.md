I recently purchased a new computer and immediately started to search for WinZip software. The license costs money and the trial ware time limit gets over in a month or so. So now suddenly without realizing that the time limit for using Winzip had lapsed I was stuck with a zip file. This is where I came across **7-Zip** which is a free alternative for **WinZip** and **WinRar**.

  * As I started of this post, **7-Zip** is a free alternative for extracting and creating .zip and .rar files.
  * **7Zip** works fine on all Windows platforms from **Windows 98** onwards to **Windows 7**. It also has a port for command line version for **Linux/Unix**.
  * It supports over 74 localized languages and also comes with integration with **Windows shell**.
  * The best feature of 7 Zip is that there is no need to even register or sign-up for using this application.

One thing the <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.7-zip.org/', '7Zip']);" >7Zip</a> website keeps harping on is that it has about 10% better compression rate compared to other applications around which compress multiple files.

Now I can go ahead and extract my zipped files without worrying about licenses. Do let me know if you know about similar free applications which can be considered to be alternatives for Winrar and Winzip? Do drop in your comments.
