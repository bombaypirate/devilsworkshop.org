  Google Chrome Extensions seems to be catering to every single need you can possibly concoct for yourself while you are browsing through sites. Previously I wrote about the Chrome extensions for Facebook lovers, today though it is a new tool that I am profusely using - Awesome Screenshot.
  
  Awesome Screenshot is a one stop shop for taking screen-shots and editing them, and it is conveniently crouching in your Chrome Browser.  It's a must have extension, especially if you are a blogger like me.

## How it works:

  * Install the Awesome Screen-shot extension to your Chrome browser.
  * When you want to take a screen-shot of a particular page or a part of the page, click on the &#8216;Awesome screen-shot&#8217; icon on your browser.

  * I chose to &#8216;Capture Selected Area&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Capture&#8217;.

  * It also has a handy &#8216;Blur&#8217; tool. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Here is a video to give you a quick guide of this tool:



I like &#8220;**Awesome Screenshot**&#8221; as it is quick, has all the tools and is always on your browser. Have you tried Awesome Screenshot? Let me know if you think it keeps up with its name. Do leave your comments below.
