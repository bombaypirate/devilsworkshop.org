All geeks prefer to read [EBooks][1] rather than going for printed books, they do it because of various benefits which EBook offers, like you can easily get them online, customize them, they are [portable][2] and you can share with your friends easily. There are many reasons why we choose to read EBooks but when it comes to downloading, we are never sure from which website we should download EBooks free and legally.

I have gathered 10 websites from where you can [search and download EBooks][3], where you don’t have to spend your money and can download the books of your interest. Here is the list of 10 websites to download EBooks:

**<a href="http://www.free-ebooks.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.free-ebooks.net/', 'Free- EBooks']);" >Free- EBooks</a>**:

To access Free- EBooks, you need to get registered on it and it is free to register. You can browse the EBooks or magazines by author’s name or categories. You can even upload your EBooks to Free- EBook.
