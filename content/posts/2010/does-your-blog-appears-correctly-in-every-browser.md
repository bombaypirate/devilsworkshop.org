There are some browsers which do not display your blog or site properly. Sometimes the font is wrong and we have other problems as HTML 5 is being used more often.

You realistically cannot install every browser and check your blog on it. So I am going to tell you a website where you will be able to see a screen-shot of your blog on different browsers and even their older versions. It doesn&#8217;t even require any sign-up or registration.

You just have to submit your blog and wait for a few minutes depending on how many browsers you have selected for testing.

  * When I submitted **[devilsworkshop.org][1]** in it, I saw that most of the browsers were showing it perfectly. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * When I submitted my blog, some browsers were not showing it perfectly.

It has more than 60 browsers listed and we can see full screen preview of every browser we selected. This is ideal if you want to get a quick overview of the number of browsers which can view your website correctly. You might need to redesign some parts in case you find a particular browser which is popular and showing your website incorrectly.

What are your thoughts on this online tool? Which browser do you use? Do lets us know through your comments.
