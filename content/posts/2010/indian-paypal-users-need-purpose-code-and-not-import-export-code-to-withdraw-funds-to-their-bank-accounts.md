<img class="wp-image-50354" style="margin: 15px 0px 0px 15px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/paypalindia.jpg" border="0" alt="paypal-india" width="163" height="260" align="right" /> Since a couple of weeks there has been chaos among Paypal users as it paused withdrawal option from Paypal to Indian bank accounts which was one of the most loved and used service among Freelancers, bloggers and service providers to receive money from outside the country.

But earlier this week, in one of its official blog, <a href="https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2010/02/resuming-local-bank-withdrawals-to-india/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2010/02/resuming-local-bank-withdrawals-to-india/', 'Farhad Irani posted']);" >Farhad Irani posted</a> that they will be resuming bank withdrawal option to Indian users if they provide with ‘Export code’ while withdrawing funds, which many people misunderstood as ‘Import Export Code’ (One needs to apply to govt. of India for IEC).  But a few hours ago, Farhad cleared that its not ‘IEC’ that one needs and its just ‘Purpose code’ that would solve your purpose!

An Indian Paypal user simply need to put the purpose code depending on the category they receive funds on their Paypal! (For ex. you need to use code ‘P0805’ if you are a blogger/freelancer/journalist). Guess this news would definitely be relief for many Indian bloggers and freelancers.

### Paypal purpose code for different categories:
