One of the major but expected changes in Facebook has been that there are no Facebook page fans. A fan is converted into a &#8216;Like&#8217; and that has started a debate amongst Facebook users if doing away with &#8216;fans&#8217; was the right thing to do.

It has been explained in numerous debates that Facebook prefers us using &#8216;**Like**&#8216; button instead of **&#8216;Become a Fan&#8217; **as people are more likely to click on Like than any other option given.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/04/27/has-facebook-got-it-right-by-changing-fans-to-like/facebook_pages_like/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/04/27/has-facebook-got-it-right-by-changing-fans-to-like/facebook_pages_like/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-1217"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-54235" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/Facebook_pages_like.png" alt="" width="550" height="194" /></a>

This makes perfect sense of **Facebook **to start really working on earning revenues from their users.

### **Pros and Cons of Like Button**&#8230;

  * I think for user owned pages like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FbKnol" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/FbKnol', 'Facebooknol&#8217;s Facebook page']);" ><strong>Facebooknol&#8217;s Facebook page</strong></a> we might not really mind the &#8216;**Like button**&#8216; as it will probably get us more followers.
  * When it comes to <a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/04/23/facebook-introduces-community-pages/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/04/23/facebook-introduces-community-pages/', 'community user owned page']);" title="community user owned page">community user owned page</a> like lets say the community page of a famous book, musician or author then people might prefer to be fans rather than having a &#8216;Like Button&#8217;

I think like previous arguments against changes with Facebook re-designs, this negative vibe to the Like button instead of Fan Pages will also die a natural death.

As long as Facebook has a simple interface that works and allows people to share things easily with their friends and also allow virtual farms and gangsters with <a href="http://fbknol.com/2009/11/16/7-tips-to-master-in-farmville/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2009/11/16/7-tips-to-master-in-farmville/', 'Framville']);" title="Framville">Framville</a> and <a href="http://fbknol.com/2009/12/29/more-tips-to-be-a-don-in-mafia-wars/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2009/12/29/more-tips-to-be-a-don-in-mafia-wars/', 'Mafia Wars']);" title="Mafia Wars">Mafia Wars</a>, people will still flock to Facebook in their millions everyday.
