While downloading, I am afraid of losing my data in the mid-way, if It gets disconnected or my browser is closed somehow, then again I have to repeat all those tedious task. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/220/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/220/', 'FlashGot']);" >FlashGot</a> is Firefox Addon which we can use to resume our download.

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/220/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/220/', 'FlashGot']);" >FlashGot</a> is a Firefox extension which is meant to handle single and massive downloads with several external Download Managers. FlashGot is the best Firefox download manager integration. It supports many popular download managers  like **FlashGet,** Star Downloader, GetRight, BitComet, Fresh Download and many other download managers.

Here do not confuse between [**FlashGet** ][1]and** FashGot**. FlashGet is a freeware download manager whereas FlashGot is a Firefox Addon.

Install this Addon and next time you will download anything you will get additional option added &#8220;FlashGot&#8221; in the pop up as seen in the below image.

Use most popular, lightweight and reliable external download managers to download all the links, movies and audio clips of a web page at the maximum speed. Below take a look at the following option which you can find it on the context-menu.

If you have better idea do share it through your comments.
