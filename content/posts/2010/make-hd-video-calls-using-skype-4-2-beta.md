Last time we shared a small hack which will let you create your own <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/home-surveillance-through-skype/" target="_blank">Home surveillance through skype</a>, now how about watching your home surveillance video in HD.

The latest 4.2 Beta version of Skype will enable you to share videos in HD. This will work only if you have a webcam which is capable of taking DH videos. You can also use your DSLR cameras as video capturing device and stream HD videos using Skype.

There was no word yet about HD Skype for the Mac.

Late this year, we can expect HDTVâ€™s from Skype, which will have Skype Internet calling software enabled. You can download the beta version of Skype 4.2 from the given link at the bottom of the post.
