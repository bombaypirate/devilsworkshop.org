Social networking can lead to a lot of trouble. ðŸ˜‰ Funny and scary at the same time. Imagine something going wrong with just one status update. You never know what your update will lead to.

Updating status with a line saying &#8220;I am out for a vacation&#8221; or &#8220;I wont be home till next week&#8221; can lead you getting robbed . These days burglars search the social networking site to see who is out-of-town and prone to robbery. Police busted a bunch of burglars and they said they used Facebook as a tool to gather intelligence on who is home and who is not home. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> One should always be extra careful while using such social networking sites.

To prevent such things :

  * Avoid such updates all together.
  * If at all you are updating, change the <a href="http://fbknol.com/best-privacy-settings-for-your-facebook-profile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/best-privacy-settings-for-your-facebook-profile/', 'privacy settings']);" >privacy settings</a> of your account. Make your post visible to only a certain number of people.

Facebook provides lots of privacy settings for your account, so keep searching new ways to be safe and enjoy problem free Facebook <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> How many privacy settings do you know about?
