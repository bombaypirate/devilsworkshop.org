Some while ago [Google Music was launched][1] and people had wondered if Apple&#8217;s iTunes had to watch out. Google Music is a nice online service to stream online music from their partners. Now <a href="http://googleindia.blogspot.com/2010/10/introducing-google-music-search-india.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleindia.blogspot.com/2010/10/introducing-google-music-search-india.html', 'Google India announced']);" >Google India announced</a> a new India specific Google Music search landing page which allows searching for Indian music.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31051" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/search-for-hindi-music-with-google-india-music/google_music_india/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31051" title="Google_music_india" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/Google_music_india.png" alt="" width="550" height="263" /></a>

## Features of <a href="http://www.google.co.in/music" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.in/music', 'Google Music India']);" >Google Music India</a>

  * Google Music India is good for people looking to stream music rather than download files of music.
  * The search feature is pretty good with the ability to limit the results according to a time frame like the 1970s decade.
  * Clicking on the link will play the music streamed for Google Music&#8217;s partner websites. This will use Flash player so make sure your browser supports Flash.

Mostly the music results were Hindi film songs but I could pull up a decent amount of classical Indian music results too. I am not so sure how good it is with regional music but I guess with time this service will only get better.

So try it out and do drop in your comments and views.
