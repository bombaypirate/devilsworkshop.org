We are in the Web 2.0 era, where there is a big focus on fonts.  Especially for the fonts that we use in the logo, they are smoother, bigger and much cleaner. This has definitely increased the number of fonts used now a days. In our day to day activities, we often stumble over to the websites that have awesome designs and logos, that we desperately want to know the font used in it!

To figure out a font type isn&#8217;t easy, especially when there are ten&#8217;s of thousands of fonts available to search from. MyFonts.com has a service named WTF &#8211; <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/', 'WhatTheFont']);" title="WhatTheFont"  target="_blank"><strong>WhatTheFont</strong></a>, to recognize the mysterious font in an image. What you have to do is simply upload the image or provide the url to the image. You will be provided with a set of closest matches available in their database.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-20462" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-find-mystery-fonts-with-images/what-the-font/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20462" title="what-the-font" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/what-the-font.png" alt="" width="625" height="104" /></a>****

**Upload the image** containing the font that you wish to recognize. The service providers suggest that the characters in the image should not be touching,  have a height of about 100 pixels, have a distinct shape and as horizontal as possible. After uploading the image, they may ask you to enter the text corresponding to some of the characters in the image, which their system wasn&#8217;t able to detect accurately.

**Moving on to the next step**, you will be provided with a few fonts that closely match the font used in your image. If it does not provide you with the accurate font, it will surely take you very close to the font your wish to use.

I am a fan of this service, and it has never let me down. If such a thing happens to you, submit your image to WhatTheFont forum for it to be reviewed by font geeks world over!

Being a blogger and a fan of latest design aspects, I am often attracted to the designs on web. The recent case being the logo for my own website. I remember, I had to search all the fonts in my photo-shop, and still wasn&#8217;t able to decide on the font. Then I came across an image logo on a website and at once decided to end my search. Knowing that I had a back-up service, that will help me recognize the font used in the image. This post was about my experience with fonts that helped me to make use of this wonderful website <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/', 'WhatTheFont']);" title="WhatTheFont"  target="_blank">WhatTheFont</a>!

What&#8217;s your experience with the fonts? How do you tackle them, when you need to recognize one in a million. Let us know through your comments.
