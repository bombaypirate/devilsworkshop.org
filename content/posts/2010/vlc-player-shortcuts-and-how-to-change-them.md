VLC media player is a highly portable multimedia player and multimedia framework capable of reading most audio and video formats. Here is a list of shortcut keys which you can use in VLC player. Shortcuts are basically used by people in order to reduce the time spent on using the software.

If you want to find out about all the available shortcuts for VLC Media Player, go to **Tools > Preferences > Hotkeys.** There you will find every single hotkey or shortcuts that you can use in VLC Media player in order to ease your movie playback experience.

But the best thing I like about VLC Player is that we can edit the shortcut keys according to our needs. In order to change the shortcut keys for VLC Player, follow the simple steps below:

Open Vlc Player and navigate to **Tools > Preferences**.

In the Preferences Menu, you will see Hotkeys in the right side bar. It will show you all the hotkeys/shortcuts as I mentioned above as well. In order to change the hotkeys, find the shortcuts which you want to change and in the field bar, it will ask you to type the new shortcut key which you want to use for that specific function. Once you are satisfied, click **Set** and it will change the shortcut key.

If you want to change it back to the original shortcut key anytime, simple go to preferences and click on Reset Preferences and it will change everything back to default.
