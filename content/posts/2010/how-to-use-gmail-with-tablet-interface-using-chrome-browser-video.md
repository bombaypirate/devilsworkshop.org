Earlier in the week Google had announced a touch screen friendly interface for Gmail. This was obviously done with an eye towards making Gmail more accessible for** i-Pad users**. It has been actually created for the i-Phone and i-Pod touch screen interfaces but it should work for i-Pad. After all it is rumored that the [iPad is a oversized iPod Touch][1].

There is a hack to view such websites including Gmail in its i-Pad friendly format. Here is how Gmail should look like with the hack.

### How to get Tablet  friendly  interface of Gmail with Chrome Browser

  * Go to **Start Menu** and look up **Google Chrome** icon. Right Click on it and get to **Properties**.
  * Here in **Properties** you can look up the **Target field**. The text in the field will end with &#8220;chorme.exe&#8221;
  * Now after &#8220;chrome.exe&#8221; leave a space and copy- paste the code below.

> -user-agent=&#8221;Mozilla/5.0(iPad; U; CPU iPhone OS 3_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.4 Mobile/7B314 Safari/531.21.10&#8243;

  * Now you need to refresh your Browser. Actually for me personally it worked only after I closed the browser and then restarted it.

Here is a video demo of how I worked with Chorme and got iPad friendly Gmail interface on a laptop with Windows 7.



Do try it out the tablet interface for Gmail and let me know what you think about it. I do not think it is of great use for everyday use but might be useful for computer with very large screens. Remember that now with this change in **Chrome** you can view any websites default mobile phone friendly version.
