Downloading all images on a particular webpage can be quite tedious. This is where I find OutWit images a great add-on with my Firefox browser.

## Features of <a href="http://www.outwit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.outwit.com/', 'OutWit Images']);" >OutWit Images</a>

  * Install OutWit Images on your Firefox browser. You can access it from an icon next to the address bar.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32033" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/download-all-images-from-any-webpage-with-a-single-click/outwit-button-png/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32033" title="OutWit-button.png" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/OutWit-button.png" alt="" width="421" height="99" /></a>

  * You can get these images with a simple drag and drop, you can also set the size or format specification. Selected images are gathered in a basket “the catch” from which they can be saved directly onto the user’s hard disk.
  * The application provides many options for filtering, viewing and saving the images. OutWit Images is the first application of its kind, specifically designed for the collection of images.
  * Its sleek, easy-to-use interface displays the thumbnails on a black background and allows to smoothly scroll through quantities of images, making it efficient and easy.

*Images taken with OutWit*:

[<img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="OutWit-UI" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/OutWit-UI_thumb.png" border="0" alt="OutWit-UI" width="514" height="353" />][1]

Do you know about any similar tools on Firefox or Chrome. I personally find OutWit the best. You can share your view through your comments.
