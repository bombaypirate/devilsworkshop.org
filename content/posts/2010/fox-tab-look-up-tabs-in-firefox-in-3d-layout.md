Looking up your bookmarks on Firefox can be a little annoying especially if we like to keep the browser clean and simple. Bookmarks and tabs being looked up with a simple click is an absolute must.

**FoxTab** is a Firefox addon which allows adding web-pages as a bookmark and then looking them up in 3d layout which makes it easy to look up these websites with a simple click.

### **About <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8879/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8879/', 'Fox Tab']);" >Fox Tab</a>**

  * <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8879/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8879/', 'Download and install FoxTab']);" >Download and install FoxTab</a> on your Firefox browser and you can start adding your favorite websites to **FoxTab**.
  * This is not just a great way to bookmark and looking 10-15 websites which you use regularly but also it can double up as a way to look up open tabs.
  * FoxTab has 3D interface while you look up tabs which are open on Firefox. As a blogger most times I easily have 8-10 tabs open.

There are obviously better options like Fox marks to bookmark websites on Firefox but this add-on is actually a better way to look up tabs. You might also like to ready about [vertical tabs on Chrome browser][1].

Finally I do think looking up tabs in 3D is quite cool. ðŸ˜‰ What do you think? Do let me know through your comments.
