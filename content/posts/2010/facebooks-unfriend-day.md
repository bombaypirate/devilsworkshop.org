“National Unfriend Day (NUD) is the international day when all Facebook users shall protect the sacred nature of Friendship by cutting out any ‘friend fat’ on their pages occupied by people who are not truly their friends”,  said Jimmy Kimmel Live&#8217;s website. The best thing is although he is a popular TV host, he is using Facebook for spreading awareness.

When you get a friend request what is the first thing you think? Well, do I know this person? Should I add him in my friend list and give him all kind of access to my profile ? Many times the answer is no but sometimes its like ‘Hey, I can add this person to increase my network and just tweak my privacy settings so that he cannot view the details.’

He believes that Facebook is cheapening the meaning of friendship by having so many friends. No body has 1000 friends in real life. Moreover, we do not feel so left out or alone on festival times. We have Facebook pages, Games and applications celebrating it all with us. In a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/facebook" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/facebook', 'recent tweet by Facebook']);" >recent tweet by Facebook</a>, they have asked <a href="http:// http://ow.ly/3aTlU" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http:// http://ow.ly/3aTlU', 'people to write about their upcoming holiday plans and re union']);" >people to write about their upcoming holiday plans and re union</a>. You need to give your name and plan for the event and the best plan will be displayed on Facebook page. Is it a good or a bad thing? What appeals to you more celebrating festivals on Facebook or in reality with your friends and family?

Facebook has surely given us freedom to share our lives on line but do you think that is required? What about the real time spent on friends, the real conversation? Are we getting too lost in Social networking provided by Facebook? Do you really need to add as many people in your friend list? People you have never met or known ? How many of you are going to take this seriously as a unfriend day? How much of &#8216;Friend fat&#8217; are your going to remove? Share it with me through the comments below.
