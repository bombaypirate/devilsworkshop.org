<!--end post header-->Lately I have formatted my PC and revamped with the latest Ubuntu 10.04 and it took some time anda effort to make sure my Microphone was working in Ubuntu. Here’s how I did it, based on referring several sources and forums on the internet.

Almost all users must have had problems in setting up microphone initially after successful installation of Linux hence in this article, lets see how to configure microphone in Linux (Ubuntu flavour).

Getting Microphone working in this method is really a child’s play.

Just follow these steps:

### Step 1:

Go to **System -> Preferences -> Sound.**

### Step 2:

Click the ***Hardware** *tab and you will find the Sound driver to be installed and the selected to the default profile !

Now, we are going to change it to our needs.

### Step 3:

Now, Go to Input tab and click Microphone 1 (if mic is connected to the jack 1 &#8211; Possibly at the back of CPU) or Microphone 2 (if mic is connected to the jack 2 &#8211; Possibly in front of CPU)

<a rel="attachment wp-att-27909" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-configure-microphone-in-ubuntu-10-04-and-skype/screenshot-sound-preferences-2/"></a><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27908" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/Screenshot-Sound-Preferences-1.png" alt="" width="545" height="494" />

Ah, that&#8217;s simple and now your Microphone should work fine! Later, I found my mic to be automatically adjusting its volume level and goes down to Zero. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The fourth step is will resolve that problem.

### Step 4:

Open Skype (Linux version 2.1 Beta) and follow the screen-shots below.

</p>

You must Unselect &#8220;*Allow Skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels*&#8221; by removing the tick mark option as below and click **Apply** followed by **Exit.**

</p>

Fortunately, the above method** **worked** **for me, hope it works great for you too. This is not only for Skype, but also for all the other IM Clients like Empathy, etc which needs a microphone.

Have you had this issue and did it work out for you? Have any alternatives? Do drop in your views through your comments.
