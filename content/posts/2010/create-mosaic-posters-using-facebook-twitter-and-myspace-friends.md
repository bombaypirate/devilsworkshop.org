I have always found these mosaic posters which are created using other smaller images quite fascinating. I always wanted to create something similar with images taken from my friends on **Facebook **or **Twitter**. There were a few web services but none of them were free.

Enter **<a href="http://frintr.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://frintr.com', 'Frintr']);" >Frintr</a>** which allowed me to create images which you can see below from the profile images taken from people I follow on Twitter or from my Facebook friends. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Features of <a href="http://frintr.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://frintr.com', 'Frintr']);" >Frintr</a>

  * Just visit the website and select which social network you want to use to create a mosaic image from your friends. The social networks covered are **Twitter**, **Facebook **and **MySpace**.
  * Once you select the social network it will prompt you to sign in with your **account **credentials.
  * This will start creating a mosaic patterned images from your friends on the network. It is low resolution and hence free.
  * I could also change the image which I wanted rendered in mosaic format. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I had written about this cool tool which [created videos of your Twitter account and usage automatically][1]. Similarly I find <a href="http://frintr.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://frintr.com', 'Frintr ']);" >Frintr </a>very cool. Go ahead and try it out. Share you mosaic image on **Twitter **and **Facebook **and do drop in your comments.
