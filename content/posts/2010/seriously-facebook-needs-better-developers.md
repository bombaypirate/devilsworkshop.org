Facebook is our favourite social network. It&#8217;s dominance is so complete that the term &#8216;**social network**&#8216; seems to be synonymous to &#8216;**Facebook**&#8216;. So I was quite surprised to see <a href="http://www.labnol.org/home/bad-photoshop-job/14354/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/home/bad-photoshop-job/14354/', 'Labnol&#8217;s post on a pretty bad photo-shop job done by Facebook']);" >Labnol&#8217;s post on a pretty bad photo-shop job done by Facebook</a>. I did expect Facebook to be full of geeks and super qualified experts.

A couple of days ago, we came across another interesting bug of sorts on Facebook. It seems to take any three W&#8217;s written in a comment on Facebook and makes it into a Link.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/seriously-facebook-needs-better-developers/fb_need_better_developers/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/seriously-facebook-needs-better-developers/fb_need_better_developers/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2512"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-52382" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/FB_need_better_developers.png" alt="" width="550" height="232" /></a>

It seems after this Facebook not only needs better Photoshop professional they also need better developers.

### Only on Facebook&#8230;

I thought maybe this happens at other places too which create html links automatically. The one I thought of immediately was Gmail chat. I often drop in just the address of a website and it automatically converted into a link.

I tried entering a similar message on Gmail chat to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/vivekvick" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/vivekvick', 'Vivek Jain']);" >Vivek Jain</a>. No links created there, but as you can see in the image, I did scare him a little bit with such a weird message. ðŸ˜›

Then the same message as my **Facebook **status got me updating my profile with a non-existent link. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
