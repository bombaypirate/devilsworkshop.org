There are many browsers in the market I get totally confused which browser supports which feature, be it HTML5 or CSS3 or something else. I Googled and I found “<a href="http://caniuse.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://caniuse.com/', 'When can I use']);" >When can I use</a>&#8230;”

<a href="http://caniuse.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://caniuse.com/', 'When can I use…']);" >When can I use…</a> page shows tables of a variety of current and upcoming web technologies. For all major browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera and Chrome, Safari). we can customize the page that shows only certain browser and features. It is  also included at the bottom of the page, which shows the percentage of the displayed features are supported.

Below there are few screenshot taken from the official web site.

Few feature may not support 100%, so what may be supported today may not actually work in the future. However it is likely that in most cases the browser will update its support as the aspect changes.

The feature list includes anything is of significant use to web designers, but still lacks support in at least one browser version. Indexes and Tables are available to compare different browser along with categories and Status, you can select browser of your choice to compare. As you select the check boxes the comparison appears on the below table.
