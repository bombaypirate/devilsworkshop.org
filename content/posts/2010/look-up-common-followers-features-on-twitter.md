When it comes to **Facebook **and its talked about **social graph **the key to increasing its relevancy is not with the number of people using it but with the number of internal connections within the network. This was mainly done with the use of looking up common friends.

This was a challenge for **Twitter **and it was a important feature for users to know who they might need to follow. So now Twitter has introduced a couple of changes.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29299" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/look-up-common-followers-features-on-twitter/common_followers_twitter/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29299" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="common_followers_twitter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/common_followers_twitter.png" alt="" width="520" height="279" /></a>

As you can see in the image above that some accounts show up as ones which I might be interested in following. It also shows other **Twitter **users who I follow are following this suggested account. ðŸ˜‰

This will be mainly helpful to people who are new to **Twitter**. Lookup these suggestions by <a href="https://twitter.com/invitations/twitter_suggests" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/invitations/twitter_suggests', 'clicking here']);" >clicking here</a>.

### Look up common accounts followed

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29301" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/look-up-common-followers-features-on-twitter/both_follow_twitter/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29301" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="both_follow_twitter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/both_follow_twitter.png" alt="" width="550" height="288" /></a>

  * I follow <a href="http://twitter.com/rahul286" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/rahul286', '@rahul286']);" >@rahul286</a> and when I click on his twitter page, I can now see common accounts the both of us follow. *(see above image)*
  * These changes will help new and old users to actually visit the **Twitter **website and not just use Twitter through apps.
  * This will be something even expert Twitter users will find useful in finding new and interesting followers. I do not like following people randomly and especially avoid some accounts which are nothing but spam.
