**F****irefox **two days ago announced that it is coming out with a release candidate (RC) version of Firefox 3.6. Previously you might have read up on [Firefox 3.6 beta version update][1]. Now with this **Release candidate** version Mozilla will probably start the transition towards version 3.7 and the much awaited and hyped Firefox ver 4.

**Firefox 3.6** has had over **5 beta **versions and using it I am very satisfied with its compatibility with add-ons while most of them have been updated now.

### Firefox 3.6 Release Candidate

  * Now you can change the appearance of the browser with a single click using **Persona**s.
  * It has improved support for new **CSS** and **HTML5** technology.
  * It will support third party applications integrating with **Firefox** to improve stability.
  * It will alert the users about out of date plugins.
  * Improved automatic form fill with better options.
  * Better **JavaScript** performance along with improved start up time for the browser. I personally did not find much difference after installing the **Release Candidate **version with the time it took to start up.
  * You can manually update it from their website but if you have **3.6 beta** version it should update automatically.

I am not a software testing expert but since the upgrade I feel the **Mozilla Labs** features which I had installed with my **Firefox** seem to be working a lot better and in a streamlined way. I think this will be quite crucial considering the applications and features in **Labs** which are present now will be the mainstay of **Firefox&#8217;s version 4**. Even though it is rumored that version 4 will be out towards the end of the year, its integration of applications lying in Mozilla labs will be crucial. I think it will get a lot better with Firefox 3.7 and we might be soon using some [features like Weave][2] in a more friendlier and reliable way.

Do let me know what do you think about the new release candidate? Download it from <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-rc.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-rc.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.
