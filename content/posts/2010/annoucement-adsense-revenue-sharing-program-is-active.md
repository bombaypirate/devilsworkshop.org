We started this blog about a year ago to blog about all things WordPress. Currently WpVeda has mostly been updated by our development and blogging teams with tutorials and tips on WordPress. Generally we avoid displaying Adsense Ads on new blogs. Now we have reached the stage were we can go ahead with Adsense Ads being displayed on WpVeda.

We have also now activated **Adsense Revenue Sharing Program** on **WpVeda**.
