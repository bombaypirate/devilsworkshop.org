Earlier we informed you that <a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/05/20/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/05/20/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/', 'Facebook was banned in Pakistan']);" >Facebook was banned in Pakistan</a> and I&#8217;m sure users from Pakistan are missing surfing on their favorite social networking websites.

Here I&#8217;m sharing few ways by which they can access Facebook in Pakistan.

**Proxy sites :**

Proxy Sites are easiest way to gain access to Facebook. You can easily use many popular proxy sites like orkuch.com, chronobypass.info and many more. Simply do a Google search for &#8220;Working Facebook Proxies&#8221; and you can start browsing.

**Ultra Surf**

Ultra surf is a small and useful proxy software which will let you access any blocked site using Facebook. This is a light weight but very effective software to access Facebook in Pakistan. Here is a small tutorial on <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-use-ultrasurf-proxy-software-to-unblock-any-blocked-website.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-use-ultrasurf-proxy-software-to-unblock-any-blocked-website.html', 'how to set up Ultra surf']);" title="How to use ultra surf to access any blocked site">how to set up Ultra surf</a>.

**Your-freedom:**

Your Freedom is another great piece of software to access Facebook in Pakistan. This software has certain limits like in every one hour you need to enter security code, to make sure you are not bot and in free version the download limit is 8 KBps. Though in case  ultra surf doesn&#8217;t work for you, this software will be a great rescue for you. You can download Your-Freedom from <a href="http://www.your-freedom.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.your-freedom.net/', 'here']);" >here</a>.

Though it&#8217;s your choice to accept the internet censorship imposed by your Government. Somehow banning a social networking site for any reason seems brutal.
