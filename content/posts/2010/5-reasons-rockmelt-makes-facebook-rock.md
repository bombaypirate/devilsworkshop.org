If you are into Social media and all and love to have **Facebook** ,twitter and everything going side by side then I am sure you will love it. As soon as [I have downloaded  **Rockmelt**][1], I am getting more and more addicted to it. Here are some reasons why you should switch to Rockmelt now if you are a Facebook addict.

  1. Earlier when I used to play games on Facebook I had to switch to another tab to see my updates and everything. Now with Rockmelt I can play games and look at the updates both on the same browser.
  2. I can update my status, chat with Facebook friends and look at the news feed all at one place while being on twitter.
  3. I can update my twitter status and look at the timeline or tweets at one place while being on Facebook in the same browser.
  4. I can find friends or any information through the  Google search provided on the upper right hand side of the page.
  5. Lastly I can have my favorite friends list. This basically gives me freedom to categorize my friends with whom I always want to chat or talk.

In the image above you can see that I am playing game as well as looking at the twitter timeline. I can also look at my Facebook updates etc. If somebody has updated a set of photographs, you can view the news feed on the same browser while surfing something else. The only thing here  is that you can download Rockmelt through invites only. If I am using Rockmelt then I can send you invite and you can join it too. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
