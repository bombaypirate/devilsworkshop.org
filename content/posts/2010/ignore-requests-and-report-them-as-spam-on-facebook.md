Whatever your **privacy** settings people still end up getting **friend requests** from unknown people. There are some people who keep on sending friend requests no matter how much you try to ignore them.

Earlier when I used to get friend requests I would just ignore the person I do not want to be friends with. Once a friend request is ignored there was no guarantee that the same person will not send me friend request again. Now, **Facebook** has changed the way it deals with spammers and repeated friend requests. Suppose a **Spammer** sends you a friend request and you do not want to add him/her to the friend list. You can **report **him as Spam or mark that you just do not know him. I did the same thing to a Spammer who was sending me friend requests repeatedly and I got this message on ignoring him: &#8220;**You ignored a friend request from &#8216;ABC&#8217;. Report him for abuse or spam, or mark that you don&#8217;t know him**&#8221; as shown in the image below:

Facebook is trying its level best to avoid Spammers and give its users a good Spam free Social Networking. After <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-is-testing-social-captcha/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-is-testing-social-captcha/', 'testing the Social CAPTCHA']);" >testing the Social CAPTCHA</a> this can be a great feature to avoid all those spammers and people you want to ignore and stop getting requests from. ðŸ˜‰

Do not report someone as a spammer randomly, this is a power given to its users by Facebook and with great power comes great responsibility. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What do you think?
