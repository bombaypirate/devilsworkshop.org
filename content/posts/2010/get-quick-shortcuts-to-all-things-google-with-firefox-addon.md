Google started of as a website which basically was all about searching things online. I even wondered a couple of days ago if Google is used by me out of sheer habit. I thought about all the Google products I must say there are a few which I use almost every time I am online.

We use **Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps** and so much more with **Google**. I personally end up being signed into Gmail from where I look for jump-points to other services like Documents, Reader etc.

**Google Shortcuts** is a Firefox add-on which really allows us to visit a page of our choosing with ease. It looks like the screen shot below.

### **About <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3576/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3576/', 'Google Shortcuts']);" >Google Shortcuts</a>**

  * The add on is pretty nifty as once installed it can be customized to show some icons next to the address bar. If that is a problem you can set it to a drop down menu like I did in the image.
  * I could edit the URL of a particular shortcut which can be useful for adding email jump page with Google apps.
  * I could select which page I wanted in the drop down from a host of options. I think I stopped counting at thirty. ðŸ˜‰

I guess another alternative is [Google toolbar][3] but I think a drop drop icon is so much cooler. Do try it out if you are using Firefox, download <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3576/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3576/', 'Google Shortcuts addon']);" ><strong>Google Shortcuts addon</strong></a> and install it. Do drop in your comments with your views on if this helps you.
