excerpt: |
  Facebook statistics on traffic and views sell like hotcakes. This was the reason 'Facebakers' as a name was perfect for a service which did exactly that. Serve up Facebook stats. But wait they are now known as Socialbakers. Sounds lame?
  
  Facebakers defines itself as 'the heart of Facebook statistics'. Well defined. It is not that Facebakers had a change of heart, they were told do so by the new owners of the word 'face'.
  
  Facebakers lets you view various statistics about the networking giant here - be it the user demographic or the popularity of various applications.

Recently, we wrote about <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-gets-patent-for-english-word-face/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-gets-patent-for-english-word-face/', 'Facebook getting a patent']);" target="_blank">Facebook getting a patent</a> over the word &#8216;face&#8217;. Facebakers was started by a Czech firm named, Candytech. On a daily basis, this site gives you useful statistical updates such as which countries are most active on Facebook and is great if you have a Facebook Page toÂ administer.

Facebaker claims to be allies with Facebook and reports that it gladly agrees to change its name.

Here is a screen-shot from the announcement on their <a href="http://www.socialbakers.com/blog/91-facebakers-renames-to-socialbakers-help-and-share-this/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.socialbakers.com/blog/91-facebakers-renames-to-socialbakers-help-and-share-this/', 'official blog']);" >official blog</a>:

They have played it smart by redirecting users who type the old URL to the new site and making it appear as though they were in consensus with the name change. The question is whether this whole name change was needed. When the &#8216;Facebook&#8217; brand name is misused for promoting illicit content, then its agreeable that the networking site gets agitated. However, if the content is as relevant to Facebook, as in this case, is this whole episode needed?

Hopefully I can still call my face as &#8216;face&#8217; in the real world without being sued. ðŸ˜›

Let me know what are your views on this recent name change. Drop in your comments below.
