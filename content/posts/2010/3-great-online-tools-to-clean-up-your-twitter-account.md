If you are using Twitter a lot you might be following a lot of people who are not really active. Sometimes these accounts are far too many and it can be a bit of a problem to keep track. Having 2000 people follow you on Twitter and following 2000 people in return is a little lame. Some accounts are robotic and others tweet too much to basically spam your timeline.

I decided to do clean up some cobwebs from the list of people I follow on Twitter and found three different services which were quite useful. So I thought why not share them with you!

### **#1. <a href="http://friendorfollow.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://friendorfollow.com', 'Friend or Follow']);" >Friend or Follow</a>**

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-28117" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/3-great-online-tools-to-clean-up-your-twitter-account/clean_twitter_friend_follow/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28117" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="Clean_twitter_friend_follow" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/Clean_twitter_friend_follow.png" alt="" width="550" height="286" /></a></strong>
</p>

  * **<a href="http://friendorfollow.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://friendorfollow.com', 'Friend or Follow']);" >Friend or Follow</a>** actually is a wonderful tool to take a few seconds and find out how many people you follow do not follow you back.
  * You can filter these accounts too which means you can exclude verified accounts from showing up. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * The best part is does show you a list of people you follow and they don&#8217;t follow you back based on last tweet or the age of the account. I guess if someone is Tweeting once in 6 months you might not really want to follow that person.

### **#2. <a href="http://manageflitter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://manageflitter.com', 'Manage Flitter']);" >Manage Flitter</a>**

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-28118" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/3-great-online-tools-to-clean-up-your-twitter-account/clean_twitter_manageflitter/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28118" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="Clean_twitter_manageflitter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/Clean_twitter_manageflitter.png" alt="" width="550" height="292" /></a><br /> </strong>
</p>

  * <a href="http://manageflitter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://manageflitter.com', 'ManageFlitter']);" >ManageFlitter</a> is another tool that allows you to clean up your account. I used it and found it very useful as it has more relevant information than Friend or Follow.
  * It shows up friend who dont follow you but also based on other behaviour like how quite is a particular account. It also simply shows inactive accounts you might be following all banded togeather.
  * All we need to do is select the accounts you want and unfollow them from Managerflitter itself. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### **#3. <a href="http://thetwitcleaner.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thetwitcleaner.com/', 'TwitCleaner']);" >TwitCleaner</a>**

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-28121" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/3-great-online-tools-to-clean-up-your-twitter-account/clean_twitter_twitcleaner/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28121" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="clean_twitter_twitcleaner" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/clean_twitter_twitcleaner.png" alt="" width="350" height="335" /></a><br /> </strong>
</p>

  * <a href="http://thetwitcleaner.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thetwitcleaner.com/', 'TwitCleaner']);" >TwitCleaner</a> promises to clean up the garbage on your Twitter account. It gives a decent view on certain followers who do not follow you back.
  * Some of these stats are interesting as you can see in the image above it shows the number of people who have had no activity over a whole month.
  * This is one of the few tools that also highlights Twitter accounts who are repetitive or only tweet links. ðŸ˜‰

Hope you enjoyed these three tools to make sure you are not following irrelevant accounts.
