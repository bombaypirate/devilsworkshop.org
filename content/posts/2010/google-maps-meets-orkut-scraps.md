Just image you are looking to meet a friend who is online. You are chatting on Orkut and make plans to catch a movie. Now you can drop in a Google Map location in a scrap you send to your friends.

Just visit the scrap book of the friend you are writing to and there is a new icon for dropping in a map.

This is nothing new with Orkut making a lot of changes in the past few months with respect to allowing people to do more things on Orkut which includes <a href="http://orkutdiary.com/features/send-files-through-chat-on-orkut/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdiary.com/features/send-files-through-chat-on-orkut/', 'sending files']);" >sending files</a> while chatting, <a href="http://orkutdiary.com/features/orkut-shows-off-photo-sharing-with-a-video/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdiary.com/features/orkut-shows-off-photo-sharing-with-a-video/', 'photo sharing on Orkut']);" >photo sharing on Orkut</a> and much more. It seems Google might be paying some much needed attention to Orkut but I wonder is it too late in the day. What do you think? Do drop in your comments.
