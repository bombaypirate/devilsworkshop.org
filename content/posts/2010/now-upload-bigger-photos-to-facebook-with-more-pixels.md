Facebook finally launches the resizing of photos officially. Now every time you upload a photo on Facebook you will see a bigger image with better pixels and hence better quality. In January Facebook made an announcement regarding this resizing of picture feature including resizing of profile pictures. But now Facebook started larger photo option on most of the profiles and will launch it completely soon. So if you are not able to use this feature just wait for few time. Hopefully they will launch the same feature for profile pictures soon.

This new feature will allow you to upload a photo of 720 pixels which is 20 percent larger than the previous upload option. Obviously this will make Facebook more interesting cuz it&#8217;s still the largest photo sharing website worldwide. But whether people like this feature or not, it&#8217;s clear that Facebook is still the number one social networking website in the world and no one can take this in near future.
