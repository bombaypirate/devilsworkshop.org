When it comes to **Facebook **people think of status updates. It&#8217;s like how cool or intelligent your <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-have-a-cool-status-update-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-have-a-cool-status-update-on-facebook/', 'Facebook status']);" >Facebook status</a> was, who all commented on it. Actually, most of the conversations get started over an update. Moreover people who are into networking or stuff they keep updating their status messages on Facebook or twitter. The problem here is you are not always bubbling with ideas and everything so for that reason I am talking about this application.

<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/status-shuffle" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/status-shuffle', 'Status Shuffle']);" ><strong>Status Shuffle</strong></a> is an application that helps you think. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Â You can change your Facebook status every minute every second and that too with a new idea. You can choose from a lot of categories like Fun, Love, Religious etc. You just need to choose any topicÂ and go ahead. Once the topic is selected the status message is displayed. If you like it use it or just shuffle it to get a new status update. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I like this application a lot because it gives you way more options and choices. Either just Google for nice quotes, search everywhere then copy paste or just start using this application and keep having cool, witty status messages anytime you want. ðŸ˜‰
