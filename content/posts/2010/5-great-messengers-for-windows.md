Few days back, a friend of mine asked me that he has [multiple IM][1] accounts and if there is any instant messaging client in which he can manage all the accounts rather than installing different software for each account e.g Yahoo, Hotmail etc.

I thought why not make a list of software which can help you login with multiple accounts at the same time. I have gathered a list of best IM clients for Windows Xp, Windows 7 which can be used.[<img class="wp-image-52366" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/digsby_thumb.png" border="0" alt="digsby" width="149" height="71" align="right" />][2]

This is one of the best IM clients I have used so far. It enables you to login to all the IM services and even social networks like Facebook, MySpace etc. I tried many different clients if someone asks me which one to use, I will definitely recommend Digsby. Main features include manage multiple IM accounts, manage conversations with tabbed conversation windows, chat history, manage emails and much more.

**2. **<a href="http://www.pidgin.im/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pidgin.im/', 'Pidgin']);" ><strong>Pidgin</strong></a>**: **

Pidgin is an easy to use and free chat client with multilingual support. With Pidgin, you can connect to AIM, ICQ, Google Talk, Jabber/XMPP, MSN Messenger, Yahoo!, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, Novell GroupWise Messenger, QQ, Lotus Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE, MXit, MySpaceIM, and Zephyr. One great thing about pidgin is that it comes with support for extensions. You can improve the functionality of Pidgin by installing simple <a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins', 'plug-ins']);" >plug-ins</a>.

I know what you people are wondering. Meebo is an online IM client which means that you don’t have to install anything on your computer and you can login directly from the web and manage different chat accounts all at one place. With Meebo, you can keep in touch with friends across dozens of IM platforms, including AIM, Yahoo!, Windows Live Messenger, [Google Talk][6], MySpace IM, [Facebook Chat][7], and more. You can even install Meebo Bar with which you can share different stories with your friends on Twitter and Facebook. If you are a blog owner you can update your blog’s fan page directly from Meebo without opening facebook.

**4. **<a href="http://www.miranda-im.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.miranda-im.org/', 'Miranda']);" ><strong>Miranda</strong></a>**: **

Miranda is another multi-protocol instant messaging client for Windows which support AIM, MSN, Yahoo, Facebook Chat, Gadu-Gadu, ICQ, IRC, Jabber, Netsend and many more. I haven’t personally tried this software but few people recommended me to try this software. The best thing about Miranda IM is that its portable. You don’t have to install it in your pc in order to use it. Like Pidgin, it also comes with plugin support and you can download plugins from a gallery of over 350 plugin.

[<img style="float: none;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/800pxMiranda_IM_logo.svg_thumb.png" border="0" alt="800px-Miranda_IM_logo.svg" width="520" height="195" />][9]<img style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/ebuddy_logo_press.gif" border="0" alt="ebuddy_logo_press" width="201" height="86" align="right" />

**5. **<a href="http://www.ebuddy.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ebuddy.com/', 'eBuddy']);" ><strong>eBuddy</strong></a>**: **

This software needs no introduction. It’s one of the best IM client for mobile devices and even its web messenger is excellent allowing you to login to chat of multiple services including MSN, Yahoo, Aim, Gtalk, Facebook, ICQ and MySpace. All you have to do is open eBuddy.com and login to the desired protocol. Simple and easy.

I got to know about this one few days back and surprisingly, I downloaded the software to try it out because of its simple and clean interface. It comes with support for many protocols and [social bookmarking/networking][10] sites as well. The reason I download it because it even support [Skype][11] as well.

I have tried almost all the clients I wrote about except Miranda. If you know about any other good IM client which I didn’t mentioned, please share with us in the comments section.
