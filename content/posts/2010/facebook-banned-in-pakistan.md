In a sad news Facebook is banned in Pakistan as ordered by Pakistan government. Pakistani government issued a notice to Internet providers to ban Facebook. This ban was a result of a Fan page in Facebook which is letting users to upload images of Prophet Muhammad.

As Islam prohibits any images of Prophet Muhammad, after few islamic lawyers won a court order, government was left with no other choice other than banning this social networking website in Pakistan.

The Facebook page named &#8220;Everybody Draw Mohammed Day&#8221; was encouraging users to draw the images of Prophet Mohammad and that resulted in this fiasco.

Though it&#8217;s not clear how long this ban is going to be, but I&#8217;m certainly going to miss chatting with my friends across the border. Do let us know what do you feel about this reaction?
