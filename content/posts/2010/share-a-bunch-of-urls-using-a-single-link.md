  I often come across a lot of related links when looking up or understanding something online. Most times I use delicious or bookmark these links to my into my browser. The dilemma is when we have to share a bunch of links in a list. Most times we have to manually type and arrange these links and send it through an email.
  
  BridgeURL is one such site that lets me group together a list of URLs and share them in a single link.

I often come across a lot of related links when looking up or understanding something online. Most times I use delicious or bookmark these links to my into my browser. The dilemma is when we have to share a bunch of links in a list. Most times we have to manually type and arrange these links and send it through an email.

<a href="http://bridgeurl.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bridgeurl.com', 'BridgeURL']);" >BridgeURL</a> is one such site that lets me group together a list of URLs and share them in a single link.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31687" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/share-a-bunch-of-urls-using-a-single-link/bridge-url-create-list/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31687" title="bridge-url-create-list" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/bridge-url-create-list.png" alt="" width="550" height="355" /></a>

## Multiple Lists in one URL

Just write in the title and paste the URLs in a link all one per line. Create a single link to share the list of links. I could also personalize the URL. When you open the URL it takes your to the the first site in a list and show arrow symbols to the sides letting you browser through page after page which was included in the list.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31690" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/share-a-bunch-of-urls-using-a-single-link/bridge-url-explore-links/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31690" title="bridge-url-explore-links" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/bridge-url-explore-links.png" alt="" width="550" height="250" /></a>

I think this is a great way to share a group of links on Twitter, Facebook or even in an E-Mail. Try out **<a href="http://bridgeurl.com/rtBlogs-List-1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bridgeurl.com/rtBlogs-List-1', 'http://bridgeurl.com/rtBlogs-List-1']);" >http://bridgeurl.com/rtBlogs-List-1</a>** which will allow you to look up all blogs we have in our **rtBlogs Network**.

**Link:** <a href="http://bridgeurl.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bridgeurl.com/', 'BridgeURL']);" >BridgeURL</a>
