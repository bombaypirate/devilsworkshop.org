Yesterday while visiting hindustantimes.com for the news I came across a very interesting and new type of Gallery which is “cooliris”. As a web developer I had used many types of jquery gallery for album viewing web pages but this type of gallery I find the most interesting one with many features of displaying news, Games and videos in three dimension(3-D)that you may have never seen till now. The Gallery can also display the locally placed album. The website for cooliris is providing very interesting features of searching based on different – 2 categories like Entertainment, Music, News, Games etc. that I will be explaining.

First of all to experience this gallery one would need to install the cooliris plug-in by clicking <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.cooliris.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cooliris.com/', 'here']);" title="Cooliris"  target="_blank">here</a>.</span> By clicking free download. It starts installing with steps on the right side to compete installation of cooliris gallery. Once you are finished installing cooliris you can start using it after restarting your browser.

The first page you will see the home page of gallery viewing. In this you will see different -2 categories

![][2]![][3]<a rel="attachment wp-att-25302" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cooliris-new-3d-album-viewer/homepage/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25302" title="homepage" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/homepage.jpg" alt="cooliris homepage" /></a>

Like Home, Featured, Favorites, Your Computer, TV and Cinemas, Entertainment, Music, News, Games on the right side above.

You can switch to any category by clicking on it. The blue cursor in the down middle can act as mouse to move the gallery.

By clicking on TV and Cinemas-> Documentaries. You will see videos automatic searched from mainly YouTube then categorized from discovery channel, National Geography etc documentaries.<figure id="attachment_25307" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25307" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cooliris-new-3d-album-viewer/documentary1/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-25307" title="Documentary" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/documentary1-600x322.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="322" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Documentary</figcaption></figure> 

And after clicking on of picture you will see video running after slowly maximizing effect.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25310" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cooliris-new-3d-album-viewer/vids/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25310" title="Video Displaying" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/vids.jpg" alt="Video Displaying" /></a>

By clicking on Your Computer and after selecting the folder you will see your locally placed images in that cooliris view.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25313" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cooliris-new-3d-album-viewer/local/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25313" title="Local placed album" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/local.jpg" alt="Local placed album" /></a>

The 3 Dimension view is like

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25315" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cooliris-new-3d-album-viewer/3d1/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25315" title="3d1 view" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/3d1-600x319.jpg" alt="3d1 view" width="600" height="319" /></a>

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25316" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cooliris-new-3d-album-viewer/3d2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25316" title="3d2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/3d2-600x321.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="321" /></a>

In the news section you will see just picture but after clicking on any picture you will see how that picture is changing into news with very charming way and the news will automatically be searched from around many well known websites like bbc.com, cnet.com etc.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25317" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cooliris-new-3d-album-viewer/news/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25317" title="news" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/news.jpg" alt="" /></a>
