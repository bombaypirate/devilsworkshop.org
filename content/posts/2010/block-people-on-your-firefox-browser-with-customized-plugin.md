I am sure if you have a lot of friends online, you would want some of them to disappear. <a href="http://blockyourex.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blockyourex.com/', 'BlockYourEx']);" target="_blank">BlockYourEx</a> is here for all the victims whose real life drama is leaking onto their virtual world. It might have been developed by someone who had an ex from hell and decided to leave room for more relationships going kaput but this feature is quite useful to ignore some without taking the pains to block or unfriend them on each network.

In case you are using Firefox you might find <a href="http://blockyourex.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blockyourex.com/', 'Ex-Blocker']);" >Ex-Blocker</a> useful.  
<a rel="attachment wp-att-31466" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/block-people-on-your-firefox-browser-with-customized-plugin/block-your-ex-1/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31466" title="Block your ex 1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Block-your-ex-1.png" alt="" width="500" height="791" /></a>

## How to go about it?

  1. Visit Ex-Blocker with Firefox and choose the 5 esteemed people you wish to block.
  2. Feed in their full name, Facebook URL, Twitter ID and even their Blog URL. You need to select one person at a time.
  3. Download the blocker, which will work like an add-on.
  4. After restarting your browser, voila &#8211; there you have it &#8211; every trace of this person has been wiped out.

I guess the technology that got us so close to each other is now being used to keep &#8220;some people&#8221; at bay. Do you know of any similar applications? Do drop in your comments.
