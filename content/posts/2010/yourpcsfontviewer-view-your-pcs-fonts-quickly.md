YourPC’sFontViewer is an online service which tells you about all the fonts installed on your computer. You don’t need to do tweak any settings or click any button to know about the fonts. Just open the website and it automatically analyzes all the fonts and displays them on the homepage.

You can change text, color, and size of the fonts and test them quickly. To change these parameters, there are boxes given on the left. In the text field, enter the text you want to display. Similarly enter the color and size of text and hit the “Click Me!!” button.

The good thing about this service is it doesn’t reload the page while you change any text. It displays the change immediately after clicking the &#8220;Click Me&#8221; button.
