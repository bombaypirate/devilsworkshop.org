Did you know that women use more Facebook than men? According to a recent study on Facebook infograhics it is clearly mentioned that 54% of women enjoy Facebooking in compared to men who surf the Facebook pages by 46%.

What do you think the reason will be? Recently a study showed the real statistics of people who use Facebook and twitter. Facebook out stands Twitter by having more than 500 million users whereas  Twitter has 106 million users only.

As you can in the image above, a lot of comparisons have been made. 88% of people are aware of Facebook, 41% login everyday, 30% use their mobiles to login, 12% update their status everyday and many more.

Facebook and twitter have become a part of our lives. If I am made to leave Facebook for even a day, I don&#8217;t think I will be able to do that. What are your views? Share them with me through comments below.
