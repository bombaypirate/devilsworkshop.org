There is a new spam now on Facebook. It says, &#8220;a girl killing herself over something her father posted on Facebook.&#8221; You should not click such things on Facebook.

Facebook is becoming a Spam-book these days. I don&#8217;t understand why such things keep happening. This recent spam shows a girl&#8217;s photo and says that she killed herself because her father posted something on Facebook.

This spam just ridicules me. How can you click on such a thing and get affected by it. Such links are made public just to Spam Facebook. When you get any such thing and you see it on every one&#8217;s profile one should get aware that it is a spam.

## In such cases:

  1. Do not click on it.
  2. Report the application/link.
  3. Do not allow the application.
  4. Do not suggest it to your friends.
