Here is a scenario. You have an argument with your boss and you really lost your cool. You went home had a couple of beers and wrote down an email to your boss telling him exactly what you felt about him in a very colorful language. Now after clicking on &#8216;Send&#8217; you get this sinking feeling. You wish you could go back 10 seconds and avoid sending that email.

I bet some developers at **Gmail **did this quite often and hence decided to create &#8216;Undo Send&#8217;. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It is one of my favorite now since <a title="Gmail allowed multiple=">Gmail allowed multiple account sign-in</a>.

### How to get Undo Send with Gmail?

  * This option still a beta feature with **Gmail **and hence is available with **Gmail Labs**. Just click on **Settings **on the right hand top corner and then look up the **Labs **tab.
  * Here look up **Undo Send **and select **Enable**. Save the changes at the bottom of the **Labs **page.
  * Visit the **General **tabs **settings **and define the amount of time you want before which you can cancel an email. The most time allowed is 30 seconds.

### How to Undo a mail?

Okay, once you have sent a mail there is an option to undo it highlighted in red at the top. Click on it immediately and then mail is not send. ðŸ˜‰

Use this feature to avoid sending emails which to wrong recipients or incase you have written something you wish you had not. But **Undo Send **should be used as absolute last resort. From a professional point of view think before you click on **send**. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
