Google analytics is a popular service from Google to track visitors on a website. Many blogs and websites uses Google analytics to know about the visitors of a site, trending topics of that site, some data about the website etc.

Till now, Google analytics haven&#8217;t recorded any personal information about the visitor but some people are concerned that Google can track the sites they visit using simple Google analytics script. So Google has rolled out a browser add-on for Internet Explorer 7+, Firefox 3.5+ and Chrome 4+ that disable Google Analytics tracking

Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. If you want to opt out, download and install the add-on for your current web browser. It supports Internet Explorer (versions 7 and 8), Google Chrome (4.x and higher), and Mozilla Firefox (3.5 and higher).

Google spokesman Brian Richardson said in an e-mail, “We take privacy very seriously and we’re committed to providing users with more choice. Though Google Analytics collects information anonymously and in aggregate only, the add-on gives users the choice to opt-out of the Google Analytics Javascript (ga.js) sending information to Google Analytics,” “We’re constantly working to both enhance the privacy options for users and provide website owners with valuable data to improve their websites.”

I personally feel that if a lot of people install these kind of add-ons then website owners won&#8217;t have an accurate statistics about their website. They will no longer be able to find out what section of their website is popular and what part they still need to work more..
