Have you always wondered if there is a best way to hire people for the job? What is the best way to measure the profile and decide if he/she is fit for the job or not?

HR section of every company goes through the process of Standard Test and Interviews to select the best candidate for the job. A lot of time companies take risk in hiring a person by making odd choices. They are continually experimenting with the type of profiles and learning to find the best way to hire a candidate. But all this is slowly changing due to the online social media. Currently, everyone can express themselves to the world through online social platform like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Blogs.

A research on human psychology has found out that maximum number of people’s online profile matches with that of their real profile, offline. This is a great finding which means that companies can trust on the online profile to judge a person. Therefore, a new way of HR sector is emerging where people are hired through Online search.

Gone are the days when you have to search for the job, the job will find you if you make your online presence strong.  We are already seeing this change, where a person being hired are contacted through their blogs or twitter Id.

Below are the five effective ways of finding people for hiring :

One of such application that allows you to search for people is buzzom search.

Entering a proper keywords in the search will immediately give you the person whose profile matches to your search query.

In Twitter everyone is sharing vital news and professional suggestion. If you search for any professional terms than you are likely to find a person who is passionate about the subject.

In order to use Google and Yahoo group effectively, one needs to find a suitable group and join the conversation. This will allows you to find more about the individuals in the group. This way you can always bring the connection in the online forums to offline relationship to an efficient employee.
