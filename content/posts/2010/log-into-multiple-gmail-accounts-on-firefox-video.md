I am sure a many of you have Gmail accounts and if you frequent internet a lot you might have two or even Gmail accounts. Sometimes for a backup, sometimes to keep work and personal related emails separate majority of us might have two Gmail accounts. For instance I have two accounts, one was a personal one, the other I use for testing purposes, like I used it during this post. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If you have two Gmail accounts and need to use them often it can be a bit of a bother considering when you sign-in with one account you cannot sign into the another account on the same browser. [Rahul Bansal][1] did write about it previously on [how to go about using different profiles on firefox][2] at the same time.

Recently I used another method by using a Firefox add on for using two Gmail accounts at the same time. For using this add-on you need to have Greasemonkey installed on your Firefox browser. If you are using Windows with Firefox you can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748', 'install Greasemonkey from here']);" >install Greasemonkey from here</a>.

If you need a complete guide to [installing Greasemonkey on Firefox click here][3].

### <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16341" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16341', 'Google AccountÂ MultipleÂ Login']);" >Google AccountÂ MultipleÂ Login</a>

  * Gmail Multi User Login works only after you have installed Greasemonkey.
  * Download the add-on by <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16341" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16341', 'clicking here']);" >clicking here</a>.
  * The add-on is installed and you can use **Gmail** multi user login. ðŸ˜‰
  * Once this add-on is installed on Firefox it replaces the Sign-Out link to the right hand top corner of your Gmail account with a drop which allows you to log into another** Gmail **account.

*Here is a video of how the Add-on works.*



Go ahead and try it out and let me know what you think about this add-on through your comments.
