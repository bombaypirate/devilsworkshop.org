In this tutorial we are going to learn how to change eye color using Photoshop. We can see a lot of tutorials about changing the color of the eyes but here I am going to keep it simple.

As you see in the image above you see the grey colored eyes being transformed into blue.

## The Original Image

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31163" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-change-eye-color-in-photoshop-tutorial/image-1-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31163" title="image-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>

  * First thing to do is to create a duplicate layer of the image. Just select the image layer and **Press Ctrl+J** for a duplicate layer.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31164" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-change-eye-color-in-photoshop-tutorial/image-2-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31164" title="image-2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-2.jpg" alt="" width="473" height="212" /></a>

  * Now I selected the above Image Layer and made a selection around the eyes. Here I use the Pen Tool.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31165" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-change-eye-color-in-photoshop-tutorial/image-3-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31165" title="image-3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-3.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="238" /></a>

  * Be careful while you make the selection around the eyes and make sure it resembles something like you see in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31166" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-change-eye-color-in-photoshop-tutorial/image-4-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31166" title="image-4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-4.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="374" /></a>

  * Now repeat the above step for the other eye in the image.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31167" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-change-eye-color-in-photoshop-tutorial/image-5-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31167" title="image-5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-5.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="219" /></a>

  * Make sure you are on the selection done to the eyes and go to **Image>Adjustments>Hue/Saturation ( Ctrl+U)** and click on it.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31168" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-change-eye-color-in-photoshop-tutorial/image-6-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31168" title="image-6" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-6.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="240" /></a>

  * Here we see theÂ  Hue/Saturation pallet display on our screen. Keep the **Hue Value &#8211; 200**, **Saturation Value &#8211; 30**, **Lightness &#8211; 0**, and keep **Colorize Check Box On**.
  * You can take any value as you like. It depend on which color was you have given to Eye&#8217;s.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31169" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-change-eye-color-in-photoshop-tutorial/image-7-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31169" title="image-7" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-7.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="335" /></a>

  * All right now Deselect the Eye&#8217;s selection just Press Ctrl+D to deselect the selection and here we got our Alter-net color of the Eye&#8217;s.

## Final Image with eye color changed
