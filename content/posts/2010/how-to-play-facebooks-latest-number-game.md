## What is number game on Facebook ?

Choose a friend and send him/her a number and he will reply with something about you in front of that number. Funny right? It could be a funny thing as well as a game like truth and dare. Only you and the other person to whom you have sent a number knows about it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

eg You sent : #2

Status message of your friend: #2 Like to have you as a friend. Lets meet          this Christmas!
