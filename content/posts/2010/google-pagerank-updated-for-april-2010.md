Today there are two good announcements for all the bloggers. First, [WordPress 3.0 is launched][1] and Second, Google pagerank is updated. We were expecting Google pagerank to be updated in 1 April and today finally it is announced. As far as I came to know, many bloggers are happy with the updated pagerank.

Google pagerank matters for all the  bloggers but there are minority of bloggers who thinks it is not worth. Whatever others might think but I find Google page rank worth of all the blogs.  For me, the first impression about any blog is via its design and value of blog by its page Rank.

For Devils’ Workshop we had a good week with[ increase in traffic][2] and we also maintained the Google pagerank with PR4. Overall, this time we really did satisfactory work with launch of new services (i.e. <a href="http://bloggertowp.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org', 'Blogger to WP']);" >Blogger to WP</a> and <a href="http://www.ilovethisdomain.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ilovethisdomain.com', 'Providing domains at low cost']);" >Providing domains at low cost</a>), traffic increment and good Google pagerank.

*Do share with us, what you think about importance of Google pagerank and how google surprised you with your blog’s pagerank?*
