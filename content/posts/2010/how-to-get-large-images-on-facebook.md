Have you ever thought how nice it would have been if you didn&#8217;t have to strain your eyes to see that image on **Facebook**? Well I have done that many times, to see an image while chatting or maybe while looking at the profile picture of someone. Here is how to see a big image on hover. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This **Greasemonkey script** named as Facebook **Large images** does it all. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
