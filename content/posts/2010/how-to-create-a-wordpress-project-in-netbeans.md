## Now to configure NetBeans project

First we need to create a new project with existing sources.

[<img class="wp-image-53736" style="border: 0px initial initial" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/two_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Existing source" width="501" height="360" />][1]

  * Now browse for the &#8216;Source Folder&#8217; where we have unzipped WordPress. *(eg: C:xampphtdocs)*
  * Then fill in your project name.
  * Make sure that the check box is selected which ensures NetBeans meta data goes into separate folder.

  * Now we can specify if the project will run as a local website or a remote website.
  * Here I have selected  it to run locally. Now click finish button to complete the project.

  * Now the project is created in NetBeans.

Run “localhost/Demo” on the browser and we can see the website we are working on.
