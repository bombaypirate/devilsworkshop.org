    We all love messing around with our photographs. I mean who does not like using a bit of Photoshop  or change the background and pretend we were standing on the moon and not in the backyard. There are quite a few image editors online with interesting features and one of them is Google’s Picnik.
    
    Now that Halloween is close, Google has unveiled some new features with Picnik to give your photographs a touch of vampires and ghosts.

We all love messing around with our photographs. I mean who does not like using a bit of [Photoshop][1] or change the background and pretend we were standing on the moon and not in the backyard. There are a few image editors online with interesting features and one of them is Google’s Picnik.

Now that Halloween is close, Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/things-that-go-bump-in-night.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/things-that-go-bump-in-night.html', 'unveiled some new features with Picnik']);" >unveiled some new features with Picnik</a> to give your photographs a touch of vampires and ghosts.

## Great move by Picnik!

This is a really great move by Google to get some much-needed publicity for Picnik. Picnik is a website with great features to edit images online. It was [acquired by Google a few months ago][2].

Google Picassa web albums are nowhere close to being as famous and Yahoo’s Flickr. I guess this is a way to give Picnik and Picassa a bit of publicity.

Go ahead and give your images a few interesting touches with Picnik. Look up their Halloween specific features.

Do you use online image editors? Which one is your favorite? Do drop in your comments.
