I could visit the <a href="http://google.com/privacy_tools.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com/privacy_tools.html', 'Privacy tools']);" >Privacy tools</a> page above and start tweaking on things. Some things like switching off the record with Gmail Chat are useful features for most people.

### Why is Google taking Privacy so seriously?

Facebook has been recently hammered and got a lot of bad press. This is thanks to its rather callous attitude towards privacy at least for a few days. But what makes people a little more concerned is how much of their personal data is stored on Google and what happens when Google creates its alleged new social network called by many as [Google Me][1].

This is just my opinion, but I think all this privacy talk by Google is trying to start laying the ground work to start introducing its social network. They might not be able to complete with Facebook&#8217;s momentum but can surely show off that they are open and will not abuse personal data stored with them.

### What would this new Social network from Google be like?

Whatever it is, Google will certainly try to integrate as much of its other services as they can with the new social network. Considering Google&#8217;s presence in Advertising media (Adsense and Adwords) a social network could be quite potent way of using such services.

So what do you think about Google&#8217;s new privacy page? Is its new social network just around the corner? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Do drop in your comments and views.
