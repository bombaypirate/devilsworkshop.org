Starting from today Facebook and Bing are joining hands.Â <span style="font-size: 13.1944px">Bing will show the searches according to your friend&#8217;s likes using the <a href="http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/', 'Instant Personalization by Facebook']);" >Instant Personalization by Facebook</a>.</span>

<span style="font-size: 13.1944px">If you are searching for people, then the search will be based on the mutual friends you have. </span><span style="font-size: 13.1944px">Imagine trying to search for a movie name just type the movie and press enter. You will see the movie results along with your friends who like that particular movie. For example you want to have a nice dinner at a good restaurantÂ and you use Bing to search for it. You will get the recommendations according your friend&#8217;s likes.</span>

<span style="font-size: 13.1944px"> You can also remove this personalization from selecting disable Instant personalization from your privacy section of your Facebook account.</span>

<span style="font-size: 13.1944px">This feature will be rolled out to people in US in the coming week. We wonder when this will be rolled out in India ? I am waiting for it eagerly, so that I can use it and tell you how it is. ðŸ˜‰</span>

Is this new search going to take over Google in any way? Will Google lose its loyal Googlers. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Share your views through the comments below.
