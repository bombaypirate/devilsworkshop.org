Have you every searched for something in a [foreign language on Google search][1]. Yes withing search settings there is an option for selecting a language you prefer to use for entering your search query. This makes Google so widely acceptable across cultures and languages.

Google today introduced a virtual keyboard on it&#8217;s search page. Below is me searching for something in Hindi and it pulled up a virtual keyboard for me to type in.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-24299" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-adds-virtual-keyboard-to-search-pages/google_virtual_keyboard/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24299" title="google_virtual_keyboard" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/google_virtual_keyboard.png" alt="" width="550" height="272" /></a>

When you are looking up search results in one of the languages supported by virtual keyboard the small keyboard symbol appears. One click on it and the virtual keyboard shows up. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

You can see in the image I am using Hindi interface for carrying out the search query. This I can do by clicking on **&#8216;Search Settings&#8217;** at the right hand top corner. This will allow you to change the **interface language** into something else other than English.

At the moment virtual keyboard is only available for non-Latin languages and that is why it is not available with English. But I am pretty sure that it will soon be available for all languages including English in the near future.

This is yet another instance of [Google adding new features to their search results][2] and showing a lot of innovative ways to stay user friendly.

### **Where virtual keyboards can be useful?**

I think **virtual keyboards** can be useful for many people, especially older people who might not find using the keyboard of a laptop very user-friendly. This can be helpful to them to just click on every character while entering a search query.

We often think computer geeks are Google&#8217;s customers but in reality Google&#8217;s biggest customers are people searching for things online to buy. Such people are not necessarily adept at using the computer. So a virtual keyboard makes a lot of sense. What do you think?
