title: 'Which one is the original? [Min.us vs Dropmocks ]'

  Recently I wrote about Min.us, a minimalistic photo gallery application, which allows you to upload and share your photographs easily. Its been making the rounds these days that Min.us is hugely 'inspired' by Google's Dropmocks.
  Min.us is designed by John Xie and Carl Hu, while DropMocks comes from Glen Murphy of Chrome team. If you visit the two sites, one is easily fooled to believe they are the same site with probably two different URLs! Keeping that in mind, it would be incorrect to discredit Min.us entirely.

Recently I <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/create-awesome-clean-photo-galleries-with-min-us/" target="_blank">wrote about Min.us</a>, a minimalistic photo gallery application, which allows you to upload and share your photographs easily. Its been making the rounds these days that Min.us is hugely &#8216;inspired&#8217; by Google&#8217;s Dropmocks.

<a href="http://min.us" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://min.us', 'Min.us']);" target="_blank">Min.us</a> is designed by John Xie and Carl Hu, while <a href="http://www.dropmocks.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dropmocks.com/', 'DropMocks']);" target="_blank">DropMocks</a> comes from Glen Murphy of Chrome team. If you visit the two sites, one is easily fooled to believe they are the same site with probably two different URLs! Keeping that in mind, it would be incorrect to discredit Min.us entirely.

Here are screenshots of a gallery I created on both these applications.<figure id="attachment_32547" style="width: 550px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32547" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/which-one-is-the-original-min-us-vs-dropmocks/dropmocks/"><img class="size-full wp-image-32547 " title="DropMocks" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/DropMocks.png" alt="" width="550" height="234" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">DropMocks Gallery.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_32549" style="width: 550px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a rel="attachment wp-att-32549" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/which-one-is-the-original-min-us-vs-dropmocks/minus-2/"><img class="size-full wp-image-32549" title="Minus" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Minus1.png" alt="" width="550" height="312" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Min.us Gallery</figcaption></figure> 

While the layout and design is starkly similar to DropMocks, it does have features which stand out.

## Why <a href="http://min.us/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://min.us/', 'Min.us']);" >Min.us</a> over <a href="http://www.dropmocks.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dropmocks.com/', 'DropMocks']);" target="_blank">DropMocks</a>?

  * **Upload Capacity**: Min.us wins with 7MB limit per image while DropMocks has a mere 900KB limit.
  * **Login**: Neither of the sites requires an account to upload images. However, DropMocks allows you to login with your Google account as compared to Minus where you have to sign up for one. One positive for DropMocks.
  * **Browser Support**: DropMocks is not supported by Safari so Min.us wins as its supported by Safari on Mac.
  * **Bulk Download**: Min.us, unlike DropMocks, allows viewers to download all the images within a gallery in a zip file.
  * **Gallery Editing: **Min.us generates an &#8216;Edit&#8217; URL, which when shared with viewers allows them to add or delete images from your gallery.

Though the user interface is very similar, Min.us wins this round with more user-friendly features. Personally though, I&#8217;m disappointed with the stark similarity of interface. While everyone is still guessing who copied whose design, what matters is which one people use. From the functionality perspective Min.us seems to come out as the clear winner. What do you think? Which one would you rather use? Let me know your views through your comments.
