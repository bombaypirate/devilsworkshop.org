Year 2010 has been too good for Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg being <a href="http://fbknol.com/mark-zuckerbergperson-year-2010/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/mark-zuckerbergperson-year-2010/', 'TIME&#8217;s person of the year']);" >TIME&#8217;s person of the year</a>, Facebook being the top social network, <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-overtakes-yahoo-and-becomes-worlds-third-largest-website/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-overtakes-yahoo-and-becomes-worlds-third-largest-website/', 'taking over Yahoo']);" >taking over Yahoo</a> and now its been declared that Facebook is more valuable than Yahoo and eBay (<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/facebook-more-valuable-than-yahoo-ebay/?news=123" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/facebook-more-valuable-than-yahoo-ebay/?news=123', 'source']);" >source</a>) .

A recent study says that Facebook&#8217;s value jumped 56 percent in the last six months or so, and is now worth more than like eBay and Yahoo.  Facebook is estimated with value $41.2 Billion, whereas Twitter and Groupon&#8217;s value has been estimated as $2 Billion. This time <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-overtakes-google-on-christmas-day/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-overtakes-google-on-christmas-day/', 'Facebook overtook Google']);" >Facebook overtook Google</a> also on Christmas. The UK traffic was more on Facebook that on Google.

Hope Facebook continues with its success in 2011 also. I don&#8217;t want other websites to do bad but well I do want Facebook to rise. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What do you think?
