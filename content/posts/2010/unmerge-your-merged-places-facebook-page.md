Some days ago Facebook launched a new feature Unmerge to its Facebook merged places pages.

Now you can unmerge your Facebook page with the Places. This can be a good thing as merged Place Pages were unable to set a default landing tab which could create a mess at times.

With the new feature you can freely unmerge things and that lets you restore all the functionalities of the separate entities. Unmerged pages have a single physical location.

Admins of merged Place Pages now see an “Unmerge all merged Places” button in the bottom left of their Page. When clicked, a confirmation message is displayed you just need to click on Confirm and the work is done!
