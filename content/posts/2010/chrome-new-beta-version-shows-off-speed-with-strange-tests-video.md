Chrome browser has come up with a new Beta version for people to start using and downloading. This time Chrome promises browser speed 2 or 3 times faster than its previous versions. Their claim is that Chrome&#8217;s beta version will be able to load up in just about 200+ milliseconds. This is as fast as 1/5th of a second!

### **Changes with new version of Chrome Beta**

  * New **Beta version** will allow using [Chrome extensions][1] while using Chrome&#8217;s **Incognito mode**. This means the cookies and browsing data is not saved but the extensions are available. Once you have upgraded to the new beta version of Chrome, open a incognito window and then look up your extensions. You can also select the ones you want so work in incognito mode individually. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * Previously we have covered [how Chrome introduced Bookmarks to be synced][2] across systems. Now new beta version allows more than just mere bookmark syncing but actually allows syncing **browser themes** and **options** along with homepages you want to be opened.
  * I think it has scored a point over Apple but having this Chrome Beta version to be the first to support **Adobe Flash Player** plugin.
  * Under the Hood there are new features which are **HTML5** compatible with support for Drag and Drop, App Cache, Geolocation APIs and web sockets. This new feature will make it easy to use [Gmail&#8217;s new drag and drop feature for attachments][3].

Google Chrome developers are known to produce strange and interesting videos. So to show off the speed of Chrome Browser they hooked up a high speed camera and shot at speeds of 2700 frames per second to demonstrate the load up time for Chrome.

Here is a Video of these strange speed tests.
