Yesterday I had a Twitter friend *@Shurbhi* told me that in my profile pic, my room which is in the background looked like it had been hit by a cyclone. This got me thinking about removing the background as I liked my picture. With a little research I came across this handy software which removes the background within seconds. It also is very easy to use and you do not need to know any design basics either.

### About <a href="http://clipping-path-studio.com/download/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://clipping-path-studio.com/download/', 'Instant Mask']);" >Instant Mask</a>

  * Just go to the <a href="http://clipping-path-studio.com/download/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://clipping-path-studio.com/download/', 'Instant Mask website']);" >Instant Mask website</a> and download the free version of their software. The Pro versions are paid software but a free download is also available.
  * Once you install it, just select the image you want the background to be removed.
  * Now select the outward parts of the background in red as show in image below.
  * Inwards part of the picture which you do not wanted deleted should be selected by green.
  * You do not need to be too specific with the outline as you can see in the image below. ðŸ˜‰

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18536" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="remove_background_image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/01/remove_background_image.png" alt="remove_background_image" width="550" height="278" />

Do try out the software and see if you find it interesting. Let me know your opinions through your comments. ðŸ˜‰
