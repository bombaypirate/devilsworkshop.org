There is a new warning put out by Facebook about a Email scam which prompts the email user to open an attachment to get a new Facebook password. This is a very dangerous attachment as what it can do once you open the attachment is, it can potentially access any Username and Password you use with your computer.

### **What to do if you get such an Email?**

  * If you receive such an email do not open the attachment.
  * Delete the email from your computer and also the email server especially if you are using an email client like Gmail fetcher or Outlook Express along with Live Mail.
  * Make sure you anti-virus is up-to date as this is a threat which already can be identified by some anti-virus software.

Do remember that Facebook or no reputable website would ever prompt the user to change his/her password or get a new one through an attachment. Most people will figure out it is a scam but the size of Facebook having 400 million active users.
