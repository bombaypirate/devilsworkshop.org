[The WinX DVD Ripper contest][1] was announced on 4th of May, 2010 and the time has come to announce the winners of the licence code worth $39.95.

I knew from the beginning as we had over 20 license codes to give out to our readers there was a good chance that the chances of winning the code will be high. The conditions of taking part in the contest were simple, all one had to do was ReTweet, before a fan of the **DW Facebook Page** and comment on the post.
