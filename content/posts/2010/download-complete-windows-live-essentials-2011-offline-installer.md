Windows Live Essentials 2011 are a bunch of free software from Microsoft which is very useful for many things like viewing and managing photos, email, chatting with friends and also other features like creating movies. It also has my personal favorite blogging tool **Windows Live Writer**.

I often see many people have limited plans when it comes to internet usage and hence might not be able to install such software. Also if you install it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx', 'Microsoft Download center']);" >Microsoft Download center</a>, you it will get an installer which installs a small file and then starts to install the complete software from the internet. This is where a standalone offline installer will be useful.

**Download: **<a href="http://g.live.com/1rewlive4-all/en/wlsetup-all.exe" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://g.live.com/1rewlive4-all/en/wlsetup-all.exe', 'Windows Live Essentials 2011']);" >Windows Live Essentials 2011</a> (151 MB)

Albeit the file is very large but it can be downloaded on your pen-drive from a high-speed connection and installed on any Windows 7 or Windows Vista computer you have.

Do not worry about the authenticity of the download link as it is from Microsoft server! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
