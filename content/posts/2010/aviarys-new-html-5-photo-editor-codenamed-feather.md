Feather is an online photo editing tool based on HTML 5 as compared to other Aviary tools based on Flash. It can also be added as a widget within your website. As compared to other photo editing tools offered by Aviary, Feather&#8217;s USP would have to be its simplicity and portability.

Readers can come to your website, browse through and edit any picture without deviating away from your page.

Aviary has kept up with great tools like Phoenix, Toucan, Raven and many more. It seems like being HTML5 is winning the battle against Flash. Or are companies bending over backwards to be visible on iPad thanks to Apple&#8217;s distaste for Flash. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
