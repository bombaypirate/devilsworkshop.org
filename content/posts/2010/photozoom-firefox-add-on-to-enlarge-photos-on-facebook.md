There can be many ways of zooming a particular photograph on Facebook, one of which is PhotoZoom 1.8 Add-on. You can zoom any photograph on Facebook, whether it is a profile photo or a normal album photo. You just need to install this Add on and move your mouse tip to that photo. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## How to use it?

  * Go to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/125440/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/125440/', 'PhotoZoom add-on page']);" >PhotoZoom add-on page</a>.
  * Click on Add to Firefox.
  * Click on Install when it asks you.
  * Restart your browser.

Once installed you will see the difference in viewing the images. They will appear bigger when you take your mouse over, as in the image below.

### How to remove it?

Suppose you are bored with this, then just follow simple steps and this Add on will be removed from your browser.

  * Go to Tools.
  * Click on Add-on.
  * Uninstall/Disable PhotoZoom 1.8.
  * Restart your browser.

This is a very simple Add on that I like. It&#8217;s not that you need to have this Add on necessarily but if you are a Facebook addict like me ðŸ˜‰ you sure will enjoy having it on your browser. If you know of any other Add on for photographs or video do share it with me through your comments.
