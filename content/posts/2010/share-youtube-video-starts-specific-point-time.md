Sometimes we want to share or send the video that should start playing from certain point of time, avoiding unwanted part of the beginning so that one can enjoy only the important part of it. However YouTube has a newly added feature, it appears when you right-click your mouse button on any YouTube video. Until you could do this manually by appending *#t=1m15s or #t=70 to a *YouTube URL.

Pause the YouTube video at any point of time, right-click select option **Copy video URL at current time** from the context menu to copy URL to clipboard. Share or send it to your friend to watch the video that begins from the point you copied.

You can link directly to a certain point inside a YouTube video instead of playing the whole video from the beginning. Whenever someone clicks your YouTube link, he gets the video to the exact point in its timeline. Its a nice feature that saves your time as well as internet usage.

Play any YouTube video and just check it out. Do you find this useful, Share it to your friends and get the most of this awesome feature.
