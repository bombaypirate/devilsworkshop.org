With more than 500 million people using **Facebook** and 300 million logging in to Facebook daily, more than **200million** people in a month¬† just login to play games only. Facebook people decided on some changes mainly focusing on making sure that content displays properly.

As reported by <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/live-from-facebook-games-announcement-2010-09" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.allfacebook.com/live-from-facebook-games-announcement-2010-09', 'Allfacebook']);" >Allfacebook</a> Friend spam over the past month have gone down 40 percent. Now mostly the complaints are about the games application on Facebook.¬† So the team had come up with new notification ideas. According to Mark people who play games for them there should be no restrictions on the content or time limit where as those who do not play games they should not be disturbed with repeated requests and most importantly those who do play on a **daily** basis for them the navigation should be very clear. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

When I logged in today, I noticed some good changes¬† like:

**Navigation** is quite useful now <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> At the left hand side of my home page I can see all the notifications about the games or other applications and choose which one to open. And notice those **blue bubbles** instead of grey text.

The requests are **better arranged** now. As in the image below we can see that the notifications are arranged in a better way. For example if I am playing <a href="http://fbknol.com/sorority-life-tips-and-tricks/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/sorority-life-tips-and-tricks/', 'Sorority life']);" >Sorority life</a> and I have gift requests etc they are arranged under the heading **Requests from Sorority life**.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-games-notifications-gets-a-makeover/sorority-3/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-games-notifications-gets-a-makeover/sorority-3/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2767"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2767" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/sorority2.png" alt="" width="535" height="198" /></a>

People can directly ignore a certain request and ignore all requests from that person. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Imagine not clicking repeatedly on **ignore button**. I am loving it !

People who do not play games are not bothered with the full detail of the game added to their **updates**. For example I do not play Farmville anymore¬† so I am just updated when a game is being added, instead of ongoing ‚ÄúXYZ¬† is building a barn in FarmVille!‚Äù type updates. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Wao what a relief, right?

Imagine when you are playing a game and asked to add a friend in between or send a gift. You just have to ignore the game altogether at that time. This new feature will be making **viral loops** more frictionless.

With all the above changes Facebook is definitely becoming cooler. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I hope they continue with the spirit and make it the best networking site in the world with no flaws at all. üòÄ What do you think?
