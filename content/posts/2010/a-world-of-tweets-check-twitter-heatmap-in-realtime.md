Twitter has become the world&#8217;s most used micro blogging platorm today and the number of people using twitter is phenomenal. To demonstrate the real-time frequency of tweets, <a href="http://twitter.com/littleark" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/littleark', 'Carlo Zapponi']);" target="_blank">Carlo Zapponi</a> and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><a href="http://twitter.com/YOUTHPROJECTS" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/YOUTHPROJECTS', 'Andreas Markdalen']);" target="_blank">Andreas Markdalen</a> came up with an incredible idea that puts all the tweets on the map, literally !<figure id="attachment_33488" style="width: 540px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<a rel="attachment wp-att-33488" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/a-world-of-tweets-check-twitter-heatmap-in-realtime/tweet-2/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-33488   " title="tweet" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/tweet-600x289.jpg" alt="A World of Tweets" width="540" height="260" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">worldoftweets</figcaption></figure> 

The above screen shot is the actual visualization of the tweet-frequency from around the world. The red color you see in some areas, increases with the increase in the tweets from that particular region. They call it the heat-map.

I had this website running continuously for 2 hr 17m which produced such a massive result of tweets as evident from the screenshot. When you visit the website yourself, the visualization will begin with a clean slate and will start to fill up gradually as time progresses.

There are 2 visualization options: the satellite view and the map view. You will find some mind boggling statistics at the bottom of the visualization.

### Try it yourself :

  * Open <a href="http://aworldoftweets.frogdesign.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://aworldoftweets.frogdesign.com/', '&#8220;A world of tweets&#8221;']);" >&#8220;A world of tweets&#8221;</a>.
  * Login to Twitter.
  * Tweet anything you like.
  * Switch to the &#8220;A world of tweets&#8221; tab as fast as possible, by using Ctrl+Shift+Tab OR Ctrl+Tab if you are using Google Chrome.
  * If you can see instantly that a tweet got processed from your country, then it was you!

Do try it out and let me know through your comments.
