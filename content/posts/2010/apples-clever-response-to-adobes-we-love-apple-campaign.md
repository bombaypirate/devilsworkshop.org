In two recent events, Apple openly expressed their <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/', 'thoughts on Flash']);" >thoughts on Flash</a> and Adobe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/choice/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adobe.com/choice/', 'expressed']);" >expressed</a> their concern for choice (and their love for Apple)!

You can see Adobe&#8217;s recent advertisements below:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25049" title="adobe-we-love-choice" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/adobe-we-love-choice-600x131.png" alt="" width="600" height="131" />][2]

While first may be unofficial, second one is from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/choice/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.adobe.com/choice/', 'Adobe&#8217;s official open letter']);" >Adobe&#8217;s official open letter</a> in which Adobe is crying for choice&#8230;

## Apple&#8217;s Response!

Here comes clever response from Apple. As you can see below, this ad highlights &#8220;inferiority&#8221; in Apple product as well as its &#8220;side-effects&#8221; at the same time! üòâ

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25050" title="Apple-we-xxx-adobe" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/Apple-we-xxx-adobe-600x351.png" alt="" width="600" height="351" />][3]

I am not sure if above one is an official response from Apple. Got to know about it via <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/05/14/apple-responds/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zeldman.com/2010/05/14/apple-responds/', 'Zeldman']);" >Zeldman</a>.

But going by history, Apple has always outsmart their competitors in advertisement-wars.
