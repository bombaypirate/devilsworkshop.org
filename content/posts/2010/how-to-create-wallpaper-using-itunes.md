Recently, I was using iTunes and I came across a trick to create wallpapers through it. By this trick you can create any wallpaper of your choice.

1.Open iTunes.Play any song.  
2.Press Ctrl+T to turn the visualizer On.  
3.Now pause the song you are playing.  
4.Now,press Ctrl+F to switch to full screen mode.  
5.Wait for the background you like.Press Prnt Screen from your keyboard.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25260" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-wallpaper-using-itunes/appl1-copy/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25260" title="apple" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/appl1-copy-600x375.gif" alt="" width="500" height="320" /></a>

6.Again press Ctrl+T to turn the visualizer Off.  
7.Now go to Paint located in Programs->Accessories->Paint(Open the Run Command.Type mspaint).  
8.Paste the image (Keyboard shortcutÂ Ctrl+V).

9.Save the image in the desired folder (Ctrl+S).

10.You are done creating your own wallpaper.

These are some of my wallpapers.
