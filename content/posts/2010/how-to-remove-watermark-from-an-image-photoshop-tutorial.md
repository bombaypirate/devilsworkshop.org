In an earlier post I had written a tutorial on [how to add a watermark to an image][1]. Now in this tutorial we are going to see how to remove watermark on an image.

For this tutorial I have taken a cat&#8217;s photograph. We can see the watermark on it and to the right you can see the image after I removed the watermark.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31176" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-remove-watermark-from-an-image-photoshop-tutorial/image-2-5/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31176" title="image-2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-21.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>

First make a selection around the Watermark text. You can use **Pen tool or Magic Wand tool** for this. But here I have used both.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31177" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-remove-watermark-from-an-image-photoshop-tutorial/image-3-5/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31177" title="image-3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-31.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="196" /></a>

Now I create a selection around the watermarked text image as shown in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31178" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-remove-watermark-from-an-image-photoshop-tutorial/image-4-4/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-31178" title="image-4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-41-600x347.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="347" /></a>

Now lets make some changes to the selected area.

  * Go to **Edit>Fill (Shift+F5).**
  * You can see **Fill Pallet** box display on your screen.
  * Here I have used** ****Use &#8211; Content-Aware, Mode-Normal, Opacity-100% **as you can see in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31179" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-remove-watermark-from-an-image-photoshop-tutorial/image-5-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31179" title="image-5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-51.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="280" /></a>

Now **Deselect **the selection. Just Press **Ctrl+D** for de-selecting the selection. You can see watermarked area filled with the background color. Now I have to remove the outline of the watermarked text image.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31180" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-remove-watermark-from-an-image-photoshop-tutorial/image-6-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31180" title="image-6" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-61.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>

For this we using the **Clone Stamp Tool (S) **

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31181" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-remove-watermark-from-an-image-photoshop-tutorial/image-7-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31181" title="image-7" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-71.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="195" /></a>

Then with the help the Clone Stamp Tool remove the Watermark text outline. Just pick the similar color of the outline near part by pressing **Alt key** and fill it on the outline *(seem image below).*

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31182" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-remove-watermark-from-an-image-photoshop-tutorial/image-8-4/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-31182" title="image-8" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/image-81-600x343.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="343" /></a>

After removing the whole outline where of the remains of the watermarks outline we have the image ready.

Sometimes removing watermark is necessary when we need to use a particular image in a certain way. Watermarked images usually are copy-righted. In this case do give credit or take permission from the original copyright holder of the image specially if you are reproducing that image in any form commercially.
