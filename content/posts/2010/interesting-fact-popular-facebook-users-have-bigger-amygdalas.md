Did you ever think that your brain has something that manages your social network? A new study shows that it all depends on Amygdala.

Well, how you manage your real social network, the number of friends you make, it all depends on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala', 'amygdala']);" >amygdala</a>, which is Â a small almond shaped structure, deep in the temporal lobe. This manages your friend circle.

Larger the amygdala, larger group of friends. Facebook has almost taken over our lives. Whether its status updates, number of likes or just comments. Some people look at their status as good or bad according to the number of Facebook friends they have.

In my opinion I think this is a very nice way to stay in touch with all your friends. Facebook if done in a limited way can be a great way to make friends, stay in touch and enjoy. More of anything sure leads you to addiction. Right!
