Whenever we watch videos on YouTube we can’t just stop at one, we keep on watching related videos but  watching all the videos waste lots of time. What if you can [download all the videos][1] together and watch it in your free time?

I came across such a Firefox Add-on which will allows you to download YouTube videos, playlists in group that too very easily and quickly . You don’t have to download any software, no time waste and your all favorite videos will be downloaded with a single click.

The name of this Firefox Add-on is **ByTubeD**. Apart from YouTube search videos, you can also use ByTubeD for videos embedded on a blog post, related search videos and from search engines results. It means it is for all those videos which are directly or indirectly linked to YouTube.

**Here is easy way to install and use ByTubeD Firefox Add-on:**

  * Install ByTubeD Videos from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/126518/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/126518/', 'official Firefox Add-on website']);" >official Firefox Add-on website</a>
  * Select the video which you want to watch, you can select all required videos in bulk.
  * Once the playlist is selected you can easily download all the videos by clicking on “Start”.
  * You can also choose the format according to your requirement like FLV, MP4 or HQ.

The best part which I liked about this Add-on is that I don’t have to use any online service or any software for downloading YouTube videos, I can download all my YouTube videos in bulk with just a click.
