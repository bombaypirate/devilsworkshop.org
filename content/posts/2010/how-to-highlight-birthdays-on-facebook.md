Many of my friends forget the birthdays of other friends even if that is displayed on the** Facebook **home page now. So for them I have searched a **Greasemonkey userscript** that highlights the birthdays. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-highlight-birthdays-on-facebook/screenshot_051/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-highlight-birthdays-on-facebook/screenshot_051/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3239"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-54489" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/screenshot_051.png" alt="" width="180" height="160" /></a>

## What does the script do?

  * **Highlights** the birthday reminders that appear on your homepage.

### How to install it?

  * Just go <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/12813" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/12813', 'here']);" >here</a>.
  * Click Install.
  * Refresh your page.

You will see the highlighted birthdays on the right hand side of your home page.

### How to Remove it?

  * Go to tools.
  * Select Greasemonkey.
  * Manage Userscripts.
  * Click Remove on Facebook Highlighter Birthday.

### When it does not work?

  * When you have disabled the Greasemonkey.
  * your friend forgot to put his birthday on his profile. ðŸ˜€
