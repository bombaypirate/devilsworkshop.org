Almost every budding blogger starts of with blogger and then <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/', 'moves on to WordPress']);" >moves on to WordPress</a>. Now that I am blogging professionally and surrounded by professional Bloggers I tend to forget many thousands of bloggers are not professional and basically end up blogging as a way to express their opinions rather than to make a living. Blogger now has released its template designer as default for everyone and not only in its draft section.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-26637" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/blogger-makes-template-designer-available-to-all/blogger_templates_editor/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26637" title="blogger_templates_editor" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/blogger_templates_editor.png" alt="" width="550" height="322" /></a>

It is pretty smart that Blogger is not trying to compete with WordPress but making itself a better platform for budding bloggers and writers who do not want to really look at blogging as a business.

Blogger a few months ago also introduced the option of [creating pages][1] and now improved ways to customize templates.

Here is a video which explains Blogger&#8217;s new features for template designer.
