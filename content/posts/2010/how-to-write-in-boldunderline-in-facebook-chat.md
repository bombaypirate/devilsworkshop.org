This is just an extension to add more spice while you are chatting on Facebook chat. <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-talk-tricks-and-keyboard-shortcuts/" target="_blank">Just like gtalk</a>, you can also write in bold and underlined text in facebook chat however there&#8217;s no option for italics.

### How to write in BOLD:

Suppose I want to write

&#8220;This is a sample BOLD text&#8221;

So just before and after the above text I&#8217;ll a an asterisk &#8220;*&#8221; (multiply/star button on your keyboard, use without quotes) i.e

\*This is a sample BOLD text\* will be shown as **This is a sample BOLD text **on facebook. Just give it a try right now ðŸ˜‰

### How to write in UNDERLINE:

Now suppose I want to write

&#8220;This is a sample UNDERLINE text&#8221;

So for this, add an underscore &#8221; _&#8221; (without quotes) before and after the above text. i.e

\_This is a sample UNDERLINE text\_ will be shown as <span style="text-decoration: underline">This is a sample UNDERLINE text</span> on facebook<span style="text-decoration: underline">.</span>

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

### Please Note that:

The code we are using for underline was earlier used for italics, so don&#8217;t confuse between both of them. Unfortunately there&#8217;s no working code for italics right now, check out this space for updates. Also unlike gtalk, you cannot use both of them simultaneously, you can either underline or bold text.

Don&#8217;t forget to share something interesting you know about Facebook Chat. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
