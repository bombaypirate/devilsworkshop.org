I wonder how many of you know Pacman. In my school days it used to be one of most addictive game and it is still the same. I have Pacman installed in my iPhone and I play it all the time. For all those who wants to go back to childhood, head over to <a href="http://www.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com', 'Google homepage']);" target="_blank">Google homepage</a> and start playing Pacman.

Pacman is today’s Google Doodle and you will also notice the game says Google in it’s style :

Notice the GOOGLE written in the form of Maze. Do let us know who think they are still addicted to Pacman?
