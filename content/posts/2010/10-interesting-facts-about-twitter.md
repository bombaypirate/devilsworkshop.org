Twitter is something I was not fond of but started using slowly and regularly when I started to blog. This is when I realized the many applications for using Twitter. Last month we had a post by [Vishwanath Dalvi][1] who wrote about [21 interesting facts about Google][2]. I thought I would do a little research thanks to Wikipedia articles and other sources I managed to put together 10 interesting facts about Twitter. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
