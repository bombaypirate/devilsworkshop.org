There were some new features that we could see for an hour.

There were almost four features that we could see on our Facebook profile<a href="http://www.techtree.com/India/News/New_Facebook_Features_Exposed/551-113832-643.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techtree.com/India/News/New_Facebook_Features_Exposed/551-113832-643.html', ' (Source)']);" > (Source)</a>. I was surprised as they were rolled out all of a sudden. Later on I got to know that those features got out by mistake, so Facebook had to be shut down to take those features away from our site. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Well I guess they should have remained, as I did like some of them. The features were as follows:

**Memories**: This feature tells you all the status updates, photos and   friendships, in short everything you did since you joined Facebook. The updates are shown year wise!

**Outside world filter**: You can filter news feed here. Some RSS feed of  some external web service could also be added.

**Light box UI for photos**: I discovered that the photos on Facebook were on a slider and a black background was present. The photograph feature was really nice.

**Submit button gone**: Submit button which is present under texts was  removed. I don&#8217;t know what may be the reason of doing so but don&#8217;t you think that will not be liked by many Facebook users?
