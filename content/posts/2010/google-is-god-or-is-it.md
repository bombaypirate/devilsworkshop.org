Google has touched  our lives in ways no one could have dreamt. Be it latest news you want to read (Google news), looking for some good pics for your presentation (Google images), or looking for directions to a new place (Google maps), Google is there to help you out every time. All this had made a strong group of Google worshippers. Lately I came across an article that shows how strong Google’s fan following has become that people are comparing it to God!

The article at “The Church of Google” (read the whole article <a href="http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/Scripture/Proof_Google_Is_God.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/Scripture/Proof_Google_Is_God.html', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>) cites some solid reasons for comparing Google to God. One of the reasons given is the omnipresence of Google. Reading this particular point reminded me of a funny video on YouTube which is on the same lines- Google Toilet.

### **On a Serious Note…**

Though amusing, the article and the video are also thought provoking. They show how much we have started relying on Google. Searching something on net has become synonymous to googling, which shows Google is rightly the Big Brother of search engines.

**But comparing it to God!!**

Isn’t that’s too much? Aren’t we giving too much hype to a piece of algorithm written by two humans? Give too much power to someone and you will be crushed by that power. Already a section of people have started doubting Google’s motto “Don’t be Evil”, because of privacy concerns, to which &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; replied: *&#8220;If you have something that you don&#8217;t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn&#8217;t be doing it in the first place.”*

Google was made to serve humans, not to control them, which is what we are making it do these days.

As for me, I don’t believe for a second that Google can be compared to God. The moment I disconnect from internet, the so called “God” has no influence over my life. Nor has it answered all my “prayers”-there are hundreds of things I searched on Google for which I didn’t get a satisfactory answer. And the latest embarrassing mistake by Google’s algorithm (see image below &#8211; pointed by <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/human-editor-for-google-news/12874/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/internet/human-editor-for-google-news/12874/', 'labnol.org']);" target="_blank">labnol.org</a>) only proves that it has to cover a long way before it can even be called the God of Internet.
