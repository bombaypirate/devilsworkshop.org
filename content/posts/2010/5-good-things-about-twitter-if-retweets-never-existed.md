**Twitter **is a great forum. It is simple, easy and very open. Lets not forget it forces people to be to the point and not waste any words thanks to the **140 **character limit. The other day I was looking up my <a href="http://twitter.com/adityakane" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/adityakane', 'Twitter timeline']);" ><strong>Twitter timeline</strong></a>. It was a mess, the tweets flowed continuously at the rate of two or three every few seconds. I do not follow a lot of people on **Twitter**. At the time of writing this article I was following 56 twitter users.

That is not a lot but still I simply could possible not read all the tweets of the 56 people I follow. The main reason for this is **Retweet**. I mean I was wondering what would happen if ReTweets did not exist. The concept just would not be around?

## Things that would happen if Retweet did not exist&#8230;

  1. Witty **comments **would not be copied over and over with **RT **in front of it. People would just have to write their own clever tweets. üòõ
  2. Blogs would not show off **Retweet **counter like it really reflected how good the content actually was or wasn&#8217;t.
  3. People on **Twitter **would actually be able to follow a reasonable number of people. I find it hard that someone following a 1000 Twitter accounts pays any attention to my Tweets. üòê
  4. Auto **RT **and all related applications would be out of business and think that would mean less **spam**. Less spam would mean **internet marketers **will not try to approach me. Seriously I wont click on a link which offers to get a zillion visitors to my blog.
  5. Finally Twitter would be cleaner and when I look at my **timeline **I wont have to stare at RT being typed a 100 times times over. I do work for **rtCamp **which does have &#8216;**rt**&#8216;, but seriously &#8216;**RT**&#8216; in front of 90% of the **Tweets **you read sounds a little ridiculous.

I must admit I am not really attacking the **ReTweet **options in **Twitter **but more venting out my disappointment with how much spam there is on Twitter. I know some users tweets 40 tweets a day. It doesnt really take much time thanks to so many [interesting applications][1] around which help you automate most of your Tweets.

Maybe we should look at Twitter as a place to speak out and share our views rather than just repeat each other. What are you views on this subject?

Do you think we would have a cleaner Twitter if **Retweets **never existed? Do drop in your comments with you view and yes if you liked this post a lot you can share with with the **Retweet button **at the top. ;-D
