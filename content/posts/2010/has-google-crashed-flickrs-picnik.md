Google recently announced that they are taking over Picnik a website which allows [online editing and formatting of images][1]. The first reaction was why does Google want to do this when they already have Picassa. Picassa is actually not a online image editor but installed on the computer. I thought I would look at Picnik and share with readers what I liked about it.

Picassa web albums is a Google product and its main competitor is Flickr. I am sure many amongst you must have used Flickr a lot more than Picassa web albums.

  * One key factor for Flickr being a hit amongst people uploading pictures online is there is no need for installing any application on the computer for editing the images.
  * If you have decent internet speed; one would be tempted to just upload images and edit them with a good editor available online.
  * That is what Picnik is for Flickr. It is the image editor for Flickr. I wonder what will Google do with Picnik as now it owns the image editing service for Yahoo&#8217;s Flickr.

### About Picnik

  * Picnik is a pretty good image editor and it is quite handy if you want to do some basic editing of images.
  * There is no need for registering or signing-up. You can directly edit images from **Flickr, Picassa, Facebook, MySpace, Photobucket and more**.
  * I could also edit an image directly from my hard drive of which I took a screen shot for giving you a better idea of its features.
  * It supports Resizing, Cropping, Rotate, setting exposure of a image, colors and sharpening images. It&#8217;s** Red-Eye** correction tool is also very satisfactory which is a must for any online photo storage service.
  * I liked the speed with which it worked and that is something I guess a very strong selling point for **Picnik**.

So do you think but taking over Picnik, Google has threatened **Yahoo&#8217;s Flickr**? Will **Google&#8217;s Picassa** web albums get better integration than Flickr is getting with Picnik? I think with this buy, Google is tying up loose ends for [Chromium OS][2]. If ever we have a **Chromium Netbook**; services like Picnik will be quite vital. What do you think? Do drop in your comments.
