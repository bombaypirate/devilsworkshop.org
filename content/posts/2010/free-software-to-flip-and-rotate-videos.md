The other day I was trying to figure out good software applications to use with my computer for formatting some home videos. Some of these were not really shot with a proper camera but with a mobile phone camera and one of the key problems was someone had held the phone upside down. At places the camera was held at an odd angle and even though I wanted to compile them all together they were too hap-hazard for my comfort.

In such cases it would be great to use software which flips or rotates the video and that is what I came across online. Guess what? Its free! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  * The software allows video to be flipped or rotated with a single click of the mouse.
  * It has predefined presets which allow rotation by 90 degrees both clockwise and counter clockwise. It also allows for the 180 degrees rotate.
  * The software works on Windows platform and is supported but **XP**, **Vista** and **Windows 7**.

This software is a boon and now I will be able to use it to flip and rotate any video I might have recorded thanks to holding the camera upside down or sideways.

If you are interested in video formats you might want to check out our [tutorial on how to convert video format for free][1] and also [how to extract audio from video][2].

Do try out the software and let me know through your comments your views on it.
