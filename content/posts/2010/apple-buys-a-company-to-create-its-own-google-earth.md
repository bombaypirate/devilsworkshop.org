Google Earth was that awesome software which allowed you to rotate the entire world and then zoom into cities, suburbs and even your backyard. It was a one of a kind software and we can spend literally [hours exploring the world][1] in a virtual way.

Now that gave **Google** a tremendous product and it even has a premium version for more advance uses like town planning and geological surveys.

Now **Apple** has decided to crash Google Earth party and bought a company which does pretty much the same things as Google Earth.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-28269" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/apple-buys-a-company-to-create-its-own-google-earth/apple_gets_mapping_service/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28269" title="Apple_gets_mapping_service" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/Apple_gets_mapping_service.png" alt="" width="550" height="360" /></a>

**Apple **has bought a 3D map making service called Poly9.com. The website has been taken down and according to <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/apple-acquire-poly9-3d-mapping-experts-1493920/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.slashgear.com/apple-acquire-poly9-3d-mapping-experts-1493920/', 'Slashgear']);" >Slashgear</a>, Apple will probably create a competitor to Google Earth.

**Google Earth** has a fantastic and massive fan base along with customized maps and other information being shown through mash-ups and extensions. This will be very difficult to replicate for Apple but I guess like Google walked into Apple&#8217;s territory with Android and then [Nexus One][2], Apple can also crash Google Earth party.

What are you views on **Apples** plan for a 3d Mapping software? Will it be as successful as **Google Earth**? Do let me know through your comments.
