RSS Feed is a nice medium to keep yourself updated with the latest happenings of the world. But tracking and reading every feeds is sometimes becomes a tiresome job.

BlogRadio is an awesome application that converts RSS feeds into audio. Now you can listen the RSS feeds instead of reading it. Awesome, isn’t it?

Download and install the application on your computer. It runs on Adobe AIR platform. Add the RSS feeds. Wait for at least 8 hours to display the feeds on the **BlogRadio** desktop manager. That’s it.  Now you can play the RSS feeds by selecting your favorite sound character.
