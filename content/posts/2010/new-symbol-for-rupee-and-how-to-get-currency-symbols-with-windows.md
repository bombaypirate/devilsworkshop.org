We might try really hard but the fact is money is probably one of the most recognizable symbols of any country. Say the word &#8220;Dollar&#8221; and we think of the US or &#8216;Pound&#8221; and its United Kingdom. The Indian Rupee has previously been denoted as INR with no symbol of its own. From now on the Indian Rupee has its own unique symbol to identify it.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-28340" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/new-symbol-for-rupee-and-how-to-get-currency-symbols-with-windows/new_rupee_symbol/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28340" title="new_rupee_symbol" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/new_rupee_symbol.png" alt="" /></a>

The process for getting it recognized as a standard is quite a protracted one and it is expected that within two years it will be recognized as the symbol for Indian Rupee. We might start seeing this symbol on your currency notes and other things like bills and bank statements.

HCL and HP might roll out a keyboard soon with the symbol being made available. Ofcourse the big change comes when Operating Systems start adopting this as a symbol for Indian Rupee and make it available across various scripts.

Indian Rupee with its popular symbol will join the ranks of the US Dollar ($), Euro (€), Sterling Pound (£) and Japanese Yen (¥).

I thought you might like to know how to write these symbols on your keyboard even they are not easily made available like the US Dollar sign is almost universally present on almost all keyboards.

While typing down use the codes below if you are using any Windows OS.

**ALT+0128 = € for Euro Currency Symbol  
ALT+0162 = ¢ for Cent sign  
ALT+156 = £ for Sterling Pound  
ALT+0165 = ¥ for Yen Sign**

What do you think about the new Indian Rupee symbol? Did you expect more or does it look just about perfect? Do let me know through your comments.
