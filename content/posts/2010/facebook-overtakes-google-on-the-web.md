Facebook has reached the top ranking beating Google according to <a href="http://weblogs.hitwise.com/heather-dougherty/2010/03/facebook_reaches_top_ranking_i.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weblogs.hitwise.com/heather-dougherty/2010/03/facebook_reaches_top_ranking_i.html', 'Hitwise']);" >Hitwise</a> . The graph below has been taken form the website which has conducted a survey of the most visited website. Hitwise claims that Facebook has over taken and pipped Google search as the most visited website.

  * Google search has been overtaken by Facebook but Google still is tops overall as a service if you take other services into account like Gmail, You Tube.
  * I think soon Facebook might come up with Email client to take on Gmail. This might actually take a lot of Facebook lovers to move away from Gmail.
  * Yahoo also is ahead of Facebook when all its services are taken into account, mainly the traffic that is with Flickr.

Before we get carried away and think Facebook is the new Google or the new challenger to Google, it would be important to note that Google offers a massive range of products and Facebook only offers a very interactive forum for social networking.
