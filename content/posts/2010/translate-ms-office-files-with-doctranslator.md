I have a friend who has to write reports in two different languages and most times my friend ends up writing two reports separately. With **Google Docs** you can actually get a decent translated text version and then of course carry out changes which are relevant to give it that human touch and iron out the intricacies of any language. But what if you do not use Google Docs?

Here **DocTranslator** is very handy as it is a great way to translate any document you have on your computer with the help of a [Google Translate][1] API.

  * **DocTranslator** allows translation of any file be it txt, xls, doc, docx and ppt.
  * It is free and a online tool so no installation required. It also does not require registering of signing up with the website.
  * There is no limit to the file size. Also it is secure as it uses the **Google API** and does not store the file you translate.
  * The formatting of the document that is translated is retained in the new document.

This website is a great way to translate documents without using Google accounts and also thanks to the API keep the quality intact because of [Google Translation kit][2].

Do try this one out and let me know what you think about it with your comments.
