It has been over a week since [Google introduced Buzz to the world][1]. Some have liked it, others have not really thought it to be very useful. I am somewhere in the middle with my opinion on Buzz. The whole idea of a mash-up of **Twitter** and **Facebook** was very exciting. That mash-up is **Google Buzz**.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-20438" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/should-google-have-bought-twitter-instead-of-coming-up-with-buzz/google_buy_twitter_buzz/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20438" title="Google_buy_twitter_Buzz" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/Google_buy_twitter_Buzz.png" alt="" width="362" height="217" /></a>

**Google Buzz** is available at **Gmail**. The constant chatter on Buzz can be a little irritating if not downright offending. Some have wondered why did **Google** not just create a separate landing page for Buzz like they have for **Docs**, **Calendar** and **Search**. I do think it would be a better way to handle **Google Buzz** and won&#8217;t be surprised if Google does come up with Buzz website very soon.

I think Google Buzz has made its way into the Gmail because of how [Yahoo Meme][2]**** went. Yahoo Meme was supposed to the next Twitter killer and ended up killing pretty much nothing. I won&#8217;t be surprised if sometime in the future Yahoo itself kills off Yahoo Meme.

This leaves me to the question on why did **Google** not just buy **Twitter**? Would it not be a great idea to have Twitter integrated to Gmail instead of a completely new social media called Buzz. I do not think I would use Twitter any less because of Buzz and it is not that I would stop using Buzz.

Twitter does not have any business model which means they do not operate on revenues as they have not monetized. Google would really make a killing if they bought Twitter and worked on it as a provider of [local news or trends][3]. It&#8217;s local search capabilities would be very highly useful. Just apply the concept of Page Ranks to Twitter profiles and Adwords to Tweet links and you have a winning model for revenues.

So what do you think? Do you think **Google** should have bought **Twitter** instead of coming up with **Google Buzz**. Do drop in your comments with your views on Google Buzz and Twitter.
