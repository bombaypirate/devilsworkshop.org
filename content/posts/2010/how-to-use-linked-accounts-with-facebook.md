Have you ever wondered how cool it would be if you do not have to login to your **Facebook account** separately? I mean what if you login to any other account and you are already logged into Facebook. Nice!

## How to login automatically?

<span style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 13.3333px">->Go to <strong>Account Setting</strong> of your Facebook account.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">->Select &#8216;Change&#8217; to <strong>Linked Accounts</strong>.</span>

Just with these simple steps you can login easily.

### Who should not use it?

If you keep checking your Facebook account from anywhere that is from your computer or from some untrusted computer, you should not use it. Imagine you have logged into your Gmail account and forgot to log out. Anybody who sits on your computer will be able to see your Facebook account if you have made Gmail as your Linked Account.
