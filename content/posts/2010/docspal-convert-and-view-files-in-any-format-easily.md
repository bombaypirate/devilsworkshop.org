File viewer is yet another feature on Docs Pal, where you can view the on your computer by uploading them to Docs Pal. This feature can be of great use for the unsupported file formats on your system or, if you do not want to convert a file, you can view it directly on their website.

You are allowed to convert a maximum of 5 files at a time. Maximum file size of 20 MB is allowed. Currently in its beta, Docs Pal is a very useful and document friendly web service.
