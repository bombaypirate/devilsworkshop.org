As a blogger and editor with DW, I have often had posts which I have reviewed written in **MS Word **and then copy pasted into **WordPress **post editor. This can cause a lot of formatting issues and subsequently a headache for someone reviewing it. ðŸ˜›

I came across a nice website called **WordOff **which removes formatting issues that pop up when content is copy pasted from **MS** **Word **to **WordPress WYSIWYG** editor.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29188" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/wordoff-cleans-up-ms-word-content-when-copied-to-wysiwyg-editors/wordoff_remove_word_formatting/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29188" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="wordoff_remove_word_formatting" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/wordoff_remove_word_formatting.png" alt="" width="550" height="345" /></a>

### Features of <a href="http://wordoff.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordoff.org/', 'WordOff']);" >WordOff</a>

  * When you come across a messy article which was copied from MS Word and pasted into a **WYSIWYG **editor just copy it all and paste it into the text box with WordOff.
  * Now click on c**lean up **and all the mess is instantly cleared up.
  * It removes all the empty elements.
  * <span>s and <div>s are completely removed from the formatting.
  * Finally the dreaded consecutive line breaks are also sorted out by being reduced.

Try out **WordOff **if you are having issues clearing by the mess which is created by **MS Word **when copied and pasted. If you know of any alternatives do drop in your comments.
