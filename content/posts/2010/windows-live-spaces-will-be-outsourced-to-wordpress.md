Microsoft has Window Live Spaces which is basically a blogging platform very similar to Google&#8217;s Blogger.com or WordPress.com. Live Spaces has not really caught the imagination of the blogging world. I guess **Microsoft** has realized that and decided to outsource Live Spaces to WordPress.com.

This basically means if you sign-up to Live Spaces you will be redirected to sign-up with <a href="http://wordpress.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.com', 'WordPress.com']);" >WordPress.com</a>.

This was announced at the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/techcrunch-disrupt-live-day-1/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/techcrunch-disrupt-live-day-1/', 'Techcrunch Disrupt Event']);" >Techcrunch Disrupt Event</a>.

## What it means for Live Spaces user?

  * Users will now be redirected to WordPress.com instead of Live Spaces to sign up for setting up their online blogs.
  * Current users will have the option of transferring their blogs onto WordPress.com or do this at a later time.
  * Live Messenger can be connected to the WordPress.com blog. This will enable all our friends on Live Messenger to be updated about a new post through the messenger. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * Windows Live Spaces will be killed off in the next 6 months.

I think this is a very good step by Microsoft as it is better for them not to keep competing in areas they are completely lagging behind. On the other hand **Live Writer** is a fantastic blogging tool and anyone creating a blog from there will now be directed to WordPress.com. Obviously that is good news for the WordPress community.

This transfer will be done between Microsoft and <a href="http://automattic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://automattic.com/', 'Automattic']);" >Automattic</a>. According to Automattic this is not a financial deal.

What are your views on this development? Do you think WordPress.com will benefit anything more than just more users from Live Spaces? Do drop in your comments.
