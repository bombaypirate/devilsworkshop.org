There are many geeks around the world and one thing almost every geek has is an active Delicious account to mark up his favourite webpages. Yes, it is the only online service which is owned by Yahoo and a tech lover actually cares about. Not to forget your own Google Bookmarks is not really making waves.

The worse part is Yahoo seems to want to kill off and get rid of anything that really we are interested in. (We = Tech lovers)

We all know that Yahoo will probably crash and burn bit by bit over the next 5-10 years. Why not salvage some of it and give it the Google treatment. Many services like YouTube, which you acquired, have become iconic names on the internet. Please make sure that Delicious does not crash and burn along with Yahoo or worse get acquired by Facebook and become trivial. ðŸ˜‰

## Delicious should be cheap!

Considering that [Google had plans to shell out $2.5 Billion to buy Twitter][1], I think acquiring Delicious could be much cheaper. Anywhere around a $100 million should be fine considering Yahoo bought it for around $15-30 million. Also Delicious has around 200 million bookmarks and we all know that the truly important stuff online is bookmarked and not shared on Facebook or Twitter. This might give you amazing access and ideal data to tweak your search engine results a little more to make a real killing.

Yours Truly,

A Delicious User and Google Fan.
