Everyone is quite good in using **WordPress 3.0** custom menus. I am going to write about a hack. with which we can put an image inside the Menu. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### Some basic information about menus :

[<img class="alignnone size-large  wp-image-51533" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/custom_menu-520x336.png" alt="" width="520" height="336" />][1]

  1. Theme Location : Shows where to place the menus.
  2. Instead of pages or categories we can also place a Custom Link with custom URL inside Menus.
  3. The main container area: Which has the actual Menu.

To place an image inside WordPress 3.0 menu, we will go for a Custom Menu. In the custom menu there are two options:

  1. URL :-Â  Link of the menu
  2. Label: &#8211; What should be the label of the Menu.

### See the Image below to add an image over the Menu: &#8211;

  1. Place your URL
  2. Place your complete image path
  3. Click on the Add to menu

After doing this , you will get the following screen:

[<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-875" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/custom_menu_image_final-520x317.png" alt="" width="520" height="317" />][3]

After clicking on save menu refresh the web page, the final output is like this as seen below :

[<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-877" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/output1-520x373.png" alt="" width="520" height="373" />][4]

  1. Image through custom menu.
  2. WordPress default pages.
  3. You can see the image code inside the code.

Now you can see, that you have an image inside a menu or we can say you have an image over the menu. The main purpose to show you this example is that we can place an image inside a WordPress custom Menu. Basically this is a hack to place an image inside the Menus, but it can come handy in some other situations also. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If you have any other such hack do share it with me through your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
