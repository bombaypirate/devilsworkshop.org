Very often, we search for the lyrics of our favourite songs on web. To address the purpose there are many websites available, the list of which can simply be obtained via search engines. What if such a thing happens that every time you listen to your favourite songs, the lyrics are displayed besides the song automatically?

**<a href="http://lyricsplugin.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lyricsplugin.com/', 'Lyrics Plugin']);" title="Lyrics Plugin"  target="_blank">Lyrics Plugin</a>** is one such plugin that provides you with the lyrics of your favourite songs, in **Windows Media Player** and **Winamp**, eliminating the need to search for the lyrics. You simply need to download the plugin and install it. After the installation, start listening to any song, and it will show the lyrics of the songs automatically.

Here is a screenshot for you, to make it clear &#8211;

<a rel="attachment wp-att-22354" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/lyrics-plugin-for-windows-media-player-and-winamp/lyrics-plugin/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22354" title="lyrics-plugin" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/lyrics-plugin.png" alt="" width="607" height="507" /></a>

The best thing about the plugin is that, you are allowed to **edit the lyrics.** You might not see the lyrics of some songs, where the above option to edit the lyrics comes to use, as you can add it yourself. The plugin also allows you to **configure** the **font size** & **type**, **background color** and **text color**. And you can even **search google** from within the pop-up window to find suitable lyrics for the song.

As clearly visible, the plugin will not work when <a title="Window Media Player in Mini Mode" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-open-windows-media-player-in-mini-mode-automatically-tutorial/" target="_blank">Windows Media Player is in Mini Mode</a>, and instead will work in Full mode on both the Media players.
