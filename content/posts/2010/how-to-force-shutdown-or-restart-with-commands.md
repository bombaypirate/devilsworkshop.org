Whether you shutdown, restart or log off, the file that is responsible for this is *shutdown.exe* in the system32 directory of your Windows installation. We will now learn to play with *shutdown.exe* giving it different parameters ðŸ˜‰ To do this, we&#8217;ll be keying in shutdown.exe in the RUN command window (available from Start >> Run) along with its parameter(s).

#### Shutdown.exe

**Casual Shutdown**: When you run *shutdown.exe* with the parameter ***-s***, your system will turn off normally, just as it would shutdown when clicked from the Start menu. For this, you&#8217;ll run it as <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown -s</span></strong></span>.

**Force Shutdown**: To forcefully shut down your PC, you&#8217;ll run *shutdown.exe* with the parameter ***-s -f***, i.e <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown -f</span></strong></span>. This will forcefully terminate all of your running processes and initiates the shutting process. This saves your shutting time when you are in a hurry and you want to turn off your PC safely.

**Timed Force Shutdown**: Lets say you want to forcefully turn off your PC after 60 seconds, here is when the parameter ***-t*** comes to the rescue. When you run shutdown.exe with the parameters ***-s -f -t xx*** (where xx is the time in seconds), your PC will forcefully shutdown after the specified time. For instance, to turn off after 30 seconds, you will enter the parameters as ***-f -t 30*** and for 60 seconds, ***-f -t 60***. <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown -f -t xx</span></strong></span>

**Restart** : If you are familiar with shutdown, it&#8217;s not much of a deal for restart. To restart, you&#8217;ll just replace ***-s*** with ***-r***. Confused? For Casual Restart, the command is <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown -r</span></strong></span>, and for Force Restart, it is <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown -r -f</span></strong></span>, and for Timed Force Restart, it is <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown -r -f -t xx</span></strong></span>. Simple, right?

**Log Off**: When you run shutdown.exe without any parameter, it stands for log off, meaning, your PC will log off. You can also use ***-l*** as a parameter to log off. <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown</span></strong></span> or <span style="color: #008080"><strong><span style="font-family: Courier New">shutdown -l</span></strong></span>
