We all know <a href="http://buzz.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://buzz.google.com', 'Google Buzz']);" >Google Buzz</a> came out like a chat message. Like we are having a chat with Google. It said, &#8220;New! Google Buzz in Gmail; Sweet! Check out Buzz&#8221; (<a href="http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/buzz11.png" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/buzz11.png', 'Screenshot']);" >Screenshot</a>; Credit: <a href="http://techcrunch.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techcrunch.com', 'TechCrunch']);" >TechCrunch</a>). As far as I am concerned, I came to know about Buzz like that only.<img class="alignright wp-image-53096" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/google_buzz.png" alt="" width="327" height="91" />

#### Buzz in Gmail

We know [Gmail was in beta][1] for over 5 years. When Buzz launched inside Gmail, someone might have noticed, it was never in beta. But why? A service which was in beta for over 5 years, and a new service which is never in beta. Don&#8217;t you think Buzz would be having loopholes? [Buzz allows you to connect with many sites][2], including twitter, YouTube, Picasa, etc and also could post those connected sites&#8217; data inside Buzz. If Buzz has loopholes, would it be safe giving out data?

#### Purpose behind Buzz

Buzz claims to be &#8220;a new way to share updates, photos, videos and more&#8221;, but why use it when there are sited dedicated for them (I mean <a href="http://twitter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com', 'twitter']);" >twitter</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://facebook.com', 'facebook']);" >facebook</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://youtube.com', 'youtube']);" >youtube</a>, <a href="http://picasa.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://picasa.google.com', 'picasa']);" >picasa</a>, etc). After using Buzz for more than a month, I have figured out it as just a platform for nothing. It is always great to use different sites for different purposes. Buzz simply slows down Gmail. How will Buzz work without twitter? Whatever I post on twitter appears at Buzz, but whatever I post on Buzz does not appear on twitter. With many people having disabled Buzz, it wouldn&#8217;t be nice to use Buzz alone.

I have seen many posts for [disabling Buzz][3], but don&#8217;t remember seeing even one stating the use of it. If I compare it with twitter, I believe nobody has enough time to manage both. Twitter is wide, but Buzz is isolated inside Gmail. When I tried to disable Buzz, it scared me of deleting my Google Profile. So, I didn&#8217;t (rather couldn&#8217;t) disable Buzz. Who would want to lose a profile which was online since Gmail only to get rid of Buzz?

Well, my point is it was fine for [Google to acquire Twitter][4], rather than coming up with Buzz.

*I would prefer simply turning off Buzz, rather than using it. What about you? Do share your views on Google Buzz.*
