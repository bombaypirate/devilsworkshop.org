Maintaining a long distance relation is bit difficult, but thanks to technology that you can get in touch with friends easily with the help of social networking websites like Twitter, Facebook etc. Apart from just [sharing music][1], messages, or [pictures][2], you can now send gifts to your friends through twitter.

<a href="http://twitgift.me/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitgift.me/', 'TwitGift']);" >TwitGift</a> is an application which allows you to send gifts to your loved ones through twitter. You don’t require mailing address of recipients, you just require twitter id.

**For sending a gift through TwitGift:**

  * You need to login to your Twitter Account
  * Select a gift
  * Send a Tweet
  * Your friend will accept it

There are options to choose from the gifts like sweets, android covers, jewellary, coffee sleeve etc. There are plans to expand the list of gifts but I guess even these are cool stuffs to gift online to your loved one.

Whenever your Friend claims their gift via TwitGift, your payment will be debited from your account. If your friend doesn’t accept the gift within a week, Twitgift will cancel your order. If your friend accepts the gift, he/she will enter the shipping address or sends a “Claim” tweet to the recipient.

*Isn’t a cool way to surprise your loved ones or online friends? Do share with us, how you prefer to send online gifts to your friends?*
