Who does not like going online for watching some of our favorite videos. One of my favorite pastimes is to play a host of videos on **YouTube **one after another. I usually take a little too much time to search for good videos I want to play and compile a list on YouTube. This is where **Play and List** is a really neat tool.

This service is a spin-off of [YouTube instant][1], a search engine that searched and played videos instantly without you needed to type in the entire query. It was based on Google instant search.

## Features of <a href="http://listandplay.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://listandplay.com', 'Play and List']);" >Play and List</a>

  * As I typed in the search query a list of videos popped up. One video started to play.
  * Every result is quickly shown in a video thumbnail format and it has a green plus sign.
  * Clicking on the plus sign, gets that video added to a list.
  * I could also share these lists with a tiny URL across various social networks.

I think this tool will be quite useful to quickly search for some video like tutorials and then add related videos or follow-up tutorials in a list. I really find some of these spin-off services very useful. In certain situations such tools can be hugely useful. What do you think? Do drop in your views on <a href="http://listandplay.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://listandplay.com', 'Play and List']);" ><strong>Play and List</strong></a> through your comments.
