People in India have a tough time overcoming traffic everyday, as they are hardly aware of alternative routes, intensity of traffic in a particular area, roadworks, etc. Waze is a free mobile application which has been in existence over a year now and a very few smart phone users in India are seen using it.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-34282" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/free-gps-on-your-phone-waze/waze-logo_bnspb-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34282" title="waze-logo_BnSPB" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/waze-logo_BnSPB1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

A general inclination is towards Google maps, mainly due to its popularity. Waze is a fairly new kid on the block and has an edge over other GPS maps, as it enables the drivers themselves to build live maps. It also gives them the power to inform people in the vicinity about real-time traffic updates, accidents, road blocks etc. The new routes created by the commuters, are added to the database of waze.

Thus, the more we drive with waze on our phones, more maps are created. If I was not eloquent enough, here&#8217;s a video explaining how waze works!



Waze can be downloaded to the following smart phones :

  * iPhone
  * Android Phones : HTC Dream G1, HTC Magic, Motorola Cliq, HTC Hero, HTC HD2
  * Nokia: E66, E75, N82, N85, N95, N96
  * Windows Mobile : HTC Touch Cruise, HTC touch HD
