Apple has had its fair share of bad press and criticism when it comes to the iPhone 4 but recently I came across this interesting post on <a href="http://codewordhank.com/product-reviews-and-rants/ipad-beat-by-5-year-old-tablet/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://codewordhank.com/product-reviews-and-rants/ipad-beat-by-5-year-old-tablet/', 'Codewordhank.com']);" >Codewordhank.com</a> which showed in a comparative chart that the iPad was actually inferior to a HP TC 1100. This may not be true as the engineering and design might surely be better but in the chart below you will see that most technical specifications are better if not as good as the iPad.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-28297" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/is-apple-ipad-inferior-to-a-5-year-old-tablet-by-hp/ipad_vs_hptc1100/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28297" title="iPad_vs_HPTC1100" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/iPad_vs_HPTC1100.png" alt="" width="550" height="445" /></a>As you can see in the image above that the iPad device is from 2010 and HP TC 1100 a device form 2003. The strange part is it has a bigger storage space and a slightly better CPU. It has support for USB, PC card, RJ45, RJ11 which are not available in iPad.

Does it mean [][1][iPad is basically like a large iPod Touch][2]? I am not sure if the comparision can really be called fair as we have not tested them for battery life and other issues. But it does beg to ask the question on why does iPad have lower features than a similar device created in 2003.

What are your view on iPad? Do let me know through your comments.
