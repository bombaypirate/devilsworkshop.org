Apple has always been known for its awesomeness. Everything that Apple designs can be called clean, simple and intuitive. **iPod **started getting Apple out of its rut almost a decade ago. The new iPod Nano seems to show that Apple has not forgotten the iPod brand in the era of iPhone and iPad.

iPod Nano is 1.61 inches wide with 1.51 inches of it being a multi-touch screen. It&#8217;s almost 1/3rd of an inch when it comes to the depth of the device. This tiny iPod Nano has been redesigned completely and that probably has given it a new lease of life.
