A lot of bloggers using Blogspot will now heave a sign of relief as now they have the option of creating pages just like the way you can create pages while using WordPress.

One of the main reasons for a lot of people to use WordPress has been the option of creating static pages. This allows the professional touch to a WordPress blog with static pages for About Us, Contact and Terms of Services. Blogger has many 3rd party methods to create pages on a blogspot blog but none from Blogger itself.

### How to create a pages on Blogger?

  * This feature is not yet available on your blogspot url. You need to sign into its draft version. Just like Google has Labs page for showcasing and testing new features and applications, Blogspot has draft. You can sign into draft by <a href="http://draft.blogger.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://draft.blogger.com', 'clicking here']);" >clicking here</a>.
  * Now that I logged into my draft blogger account, all I needed was to go to my blog&#8217;s dashboard and visit the **Posting** section and I saw a new tab named &#8216;**Edit Pages**&#8216;.

  * I could create pages and also add them to either blog sidebar or to blog tabs under the header. Just create a page and you will be prompted automatically to select with the pages widget.

### Blogger trying stop the migration?

I still think that Blogger is something that people love using for its simplicity. The sheer number of features do make WordPress a little daunting for someone starting out as a blogger. But most times when a bloggers has a decent following starts to look to migrate to a WordPress hosted blog. Even the founder of DW, [Rahul Bansal][1] first started writing on a Blogger but then moved to WordPress. He even wrote a post on [how to migrate from Blogger to WordPress][2].

**WordPress** has the ability to create pages which does make a first choice for many developers as it is not just blog oriented. Blogger with the option of creating pages will obviously make it better for **blogspot** fans to stay on and not migrate.

What do you think? Will Blogger give WordPress competition in the future?
