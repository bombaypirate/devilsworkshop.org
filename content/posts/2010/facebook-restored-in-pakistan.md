Nearly two weeks after ordering Pakistan Telecommunications Authority(PTA) to <a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/05/20/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/05/20/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/', 'Ban Facebook in Pakistan']);" title="Facebook Banned in Pakistan "  target="_blank">Ban Facebook in Pakistan</a>, Lahore High court has reversed its orders by lifting the temporary ban imposed on access to the social networking website. The ban came in as a result of the nation-wide protests in Pakistan due to Facebook event &#8220;Everyone Draw Mohammad Day&#8221; organized by a group of people on a community page.

> In a statement, Justice Chaudhry told the court,“Restore Facebook. We don’t want to block access to information” .

Ban was lifted this morning after assurance from the government that they will soon develop a system that blocks offending images, referring to it as &#8220;blasphemous material&#8221; from the internet, that arouse resentment among the people and brought them on to the streets. Similar to blocking of un-islamic content from you-tube that was un-banned last week, after similar orders from the court.

Yesterday, Facebook was also <a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/05/31/facebook-banned-in-bangladesh/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/05/31/facebook-banned-in-bangladesh/', 'Banned in Bangladesh']);" title="Facebook Banned in Bangladesh "  target="_blank">Banned in Bangladesh</a> due to the offending images from the page as a result of the contest, which led to on-street protest in the country. After the orders from Pakistan High court, we expect that the ban will soon be uplifted in Bangladesh also.
