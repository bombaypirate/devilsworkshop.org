Google has practically replaced the word &#8220;search&#8221;.Â  Forget the internet, think of an abnormal day where you aren&#8217;t involved with the computer at all, you wake up &#8211; look for your glasses &#8211; slippers &#8211; clothes &#8211; keys &#8211; a way through the traffic &#8211; parking &#8211; the search never ends. If there is one entity that can define and then *re*define this word, it has to be Google.

**Google Instant Preview** takes it to a new level. You are probably aware of the recent breakthrough with Google Instant which throws up search results as you type the search query. With **Instant Preview,** the user can preview the website of each search result before choosing to visit the page.
