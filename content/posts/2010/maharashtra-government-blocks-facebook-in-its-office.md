In the recent past, we have witnessed a lot of flak with regards to <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/', 'Facebook Banned in Pakistan']);" target="_blank">Facebook Banned in Pakistan</a> . The reasons for the ban were cited as users being uploading images of Prophet Muhammad. Apparently, it was a religious issue and the authorities had to ban Facebook.

But, in what seems like a funny revelation, Maharashtra government has banned Facebook in the Mantralaya (Office). The reason for blocking the social networking site has been cited as **Employees whiling away their time on Facebook during office hours **as mentioned by a senior official,

I am not going to go into the details of that incident for obvious reasons but apart from that, do we actually have employees/ministers in the mantralaya networking with their friends or the people out there. I have my doubts but I am really curious to understand as to what they are actually doing on Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If not anything else, this move might set a good example in other ministries when it comes to employees making the best use of their time when they are in office.
