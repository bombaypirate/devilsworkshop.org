Social networks have really captured a lot of attention for many people to stay in touch with each other. **Email **still remains the most important way to pass confidential and personal information. I mean we cannot discuss a business proposal over **Facebook **or **Orkut **can we! ðŸ˜›

Most people use their email address to register to social networks like **Twitter**, **Facebook **and **Linked in**. **Rapportive **is a awesome online tool which shows relative information corresponding to the email id. (see image below)

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29360" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/rapportive-get-details-of-your-gmail-contacts-from-various-sources/rapportive_gmail_contacts_info/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29360" title="rapportive_gmail_contacts_info" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/rapportive_gmail_contacts_info.png" alt="" width="550" height="275" /></a>

As you see in the image above, with my email id you can see links to my **Linked In**, **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **hi5**, **Blogger **and **Flickr **profile.

### Features of <a href="http://rapportive.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rapportive.com', 'Rapportive']);" >Rapportive</a>

  * **Rapportive **needs to be installed on the browser as a addon with Firefox or an extension with Chrome.
  * **Rapportive **works with Gmail and when I opened a message it search for information about that email address and displays it on the right hand column where usually **Gmail **displays sponsored links. I have never ever clicked on these links through **Gmail **so for me this is a great use of space on Gmail&#8217;s layout. ðŸ˜‰
  * Another feature I liked is I could leave **notes **about the email addresses which is very useful. Sometimes we need to remember certain things about someone we send an email.

There are many add-ons around which can change the way Gmail layout is or can even give added information on **Gmail** itself. But **Rapportive **will probably change the way I look at email ids for sometime. Use **Rapportive **on a **Gmail **account which you use professionally and to which you get a lot of emails from a lot of different people.

Try out <a href="http://rapportive.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rapportive.com', 'Rapportive']);" ><strong>Rapportive</strong></a>** **and do let me know your views on it or even share any similar internet service. Do drop in your comments.
