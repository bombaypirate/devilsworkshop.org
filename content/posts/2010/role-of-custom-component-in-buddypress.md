    Buddypress (BP) a buzz in the world of bloggers. It provides an open platform for the wordpress users to share their views and ideas. In other terms it will let you create a social community around your WordPress blog.  It has predefined rich set of components that is enough for a social-networking platform. Yet there is something missing.This missing part in the words of buddypress are CUSTOM COMPONENTS. These custom component can be anything that can provide a rich set of features that is a value added advantage to the Buddypress.

      Let me try to make the picture more clear to you. Let me have pleasure to introduce BUDDYPRESS. Buddypress is a sort of plugin that can be activated as we do to other plugins but it takes wordpress blog to a next level. It enriches the wordpress blog by its features like activity, groups, friends, forums, etc .etc. But the more you give to users the more they want. This thirst let to the formation of a group of developers call Buddypress developers.

      Buddypress custom component developers instincts their ideas with their own custom component and the wordpress users roam freely through the website with ease.

      Till now development of custom component for buddypress is reached its new heights. Every now n then developers release their own custom component that nicely integrates with the buddypress core component. Buddypress has a huge base of approximately 16000 members.

      Custom components like  <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-kaltura-media-component/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-kaltura-media-component/', 'Buddypress Media Component']);" title="Buddypress Media Component">Buddypress Media Component</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-links/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-links/', 'Bp-links']);" title="BP LINKS +">Bp-links</a> are few to name them. These are wonderful plugins that nicely integrate with the BP.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      To end with I would like to say that the real power of buddypress comes with its components  more or less custom components plays a vital role in this battlefield of open source community..
