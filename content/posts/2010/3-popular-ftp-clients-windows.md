Do you use FTP based protocol to manage your files on your web-server? If yes, then you may find this information useful. Before that lets know more about how FTP works.

FTP stands for **File Transfer Protocol. **FTP is used extensively in Web Development and maintenance. Using FTP is simple and does not need any software (only the protocol has to be installed on your Operating system). You can even directly connect to your web server using the following pattern: ftp://yourwebsite.com/, however this might be a tedious thing using it directly on your Web browser. FTP clients are meant to make this work much easier and systematic.
