If we have to believe the modern day grapevine &#8211; Twitter &#8211; it seems like an end to Yahoo&#8217;s popular social bookmarking site, <a href="http://www.delicious.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.delicious.com/', 'Delicious']);" target="_blank">Delicious</a>. Seems like soon bookmarking is not going to be *oh so tasty*.

## The Tweet that started it all:

The news spread like wildfire after being triggered by one little tweet by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bpm140" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/bpm140', 'Eric Marcoullier']);" target="_blank">Eric Marcoullier</a>:

## The Leaked Yahoo! Screenshot:

<a rel="attachment wp-att-34600" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/yahoo-cooking-delicious-demise/eric_marcoullier_tweet/"></a>Eric Marcoullier, associated with Yahoo as the founder of MyBlogLog, shared a screenshot of Yahoo Inc&#8217;s webcast declaring the end of several product lines including MyBlogLog, AltaVista, Yahoo! Picks, Yahoo! Bookmarks, Yahoo! Buzz and Delicious. The leak obviously spurred a series of reactions &#8211; infuriating andÂ flattering. The screenshot confirms the plans of the company towards calling quits with Delicious.

## The scoop:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)', 'Delicious']);" target="_blank">Delicious</a> is a popular social bookmarking site started in 2003 and acquired by Yahoo! in 2005.

The spotlight center focus dawned on Yahoo! after the series of layoffs couple of days back. About 650 to 700 employees are rumored to have lost their jobs, primarily from the product department headed by Blake Irwing. Most of the layoffs clashed with the team coordinating with Delicious. Followed by the screenshot revealing the plans to cut off on Delicious.

## The Aftermath:

Officially nothing has been declared by Yahoo regarding the &#8216;yummy&#8217; bookmarking site but you can&#8217;t help but wonder &#8211; what after Delicious. This would turn the tables around for Yahoo considering how widespread the usage has been with the site. There are no second thoughts when it comes to understanding the internet giant&#8217;s plan of downsizing but whether their selection has faltered, only time will tell.
