The best part about the internet is that we can share our interests with similar people who we may never know. It is often said that music has no borders. This has been proven with these online services which allow you to create and share your favorite music with people from all over. You can now listen to music based simply on genres or even your mood. Here is a list of few of my latest discoveries which managed to keep me quiet for few hours. ðŸ˜›

## #1. <a href="http://www.mixpod.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mixpod.com/', 'Mixpod.com']);" target="_blank">Mixpod.com</a>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Here you can either create your own play-list by selecting each track on your own or based on popular songs. Go a step ahead and personalize the appearance of your playlist with an antique transistor look or an electric red snazzy iPod skin. If you donâ€™t have the patience to pick and choose, pick up any of the playlists already present with a good range of artists. All this can be done without creating an account which makes it more convenient. <a rel="attachment wp-att-31578" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-sites-to-create-customized-playlists-online/mixpod_me-playlist2/"><img class="size-full wp-image-31578 alignnone" title="Mixpod_me Playlist2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Mixpod_me-Playlist2.png" alt="" width="197" height="215" /></a>

## #2. <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://listen.grooveshark.com/', 'Grooveshark']);" target="_blank">Grooveshark</a>

This one was my personal favourite. Its got a well designed interface as well as the search results thrown are a good blend of originals alternated with covers. Every song you search for goes into a panel of thumbnails which you can later save as a playlist or export to a widget over your webpage. Another point is that you can customize the settings and appearance.

## #3. <a href="http://mixtape.me" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mixtape.me', 'Mixtape.me']);" target="_blank">Mixtape.me</a>

You can get great playlists here as well with the added option of a â€˜drag and dropâ€™ wherein you can pick up songs you like and drop them into your personal playlist. Fortunately the song which is playing meanwhile doesnâ€™t stop through this process. You can shortlist while searching itself whether you are looking for songs in particular or playlists in general.<a rel="attachment wp-att-31583" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-sites-to-create-customized-playlists-online/mixtape-logo/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31583" title="MixTape logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/MixTape-logo.png" alt="" width="304" height="101" /></a>

## <a href="http://yompe.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://yompe.com/', '#4. Yompe.com']);" target="_blank">#4. Yompe.com</a>

Finally there is a place where you can create a playlist of your favorite YouTube videos! If you donâ€™t have a YouTube account and need to make a playlist of its videos, Yompe is perfect. Create an account in less than a minute, name your playlist and feed in the URL of your videos.

## #5. <a href="http://8tracks.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://8tracks.com/', '8tracks.com']);" target="_blank">8tracks.com</a>

This site has a wide range of playlists each with few tracks. It&#8217;s great for streaming your own music with 8 or more tracks.<a rel="attachment wp-att-31586" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-sites-to-create-customized-playlists-online/8tracks_2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31586" title="8tracks_2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/8tracks_2.png" alt="" width="428" height="296" /></a>

What I really like in most of these applications are the outrageous names some playlists have. I often find it useful to play one of these playlists, while trying to find words for the next post I am working on.

Do let me know what you think about these or if you know of any better alternative applications.
