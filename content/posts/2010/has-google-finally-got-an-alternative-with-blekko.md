excerpt: "Blekko is a new search engine launched on November 8 which has attempted at renewing your regular search quest. Rich Skrenta, of the Newhoo fame (now Netscape's Open Directory Project), has been working on this concept search engine since 2007. It works basically by categorizing the search word using slash tags ('/'), using these tags to arrive at more specific results. Thereby, it reduces the spams and irrelevant results, optimizing the entire search process."

Alright the heading is rather dramatic, but what we&#8217;ve got here seems worth it.

<a href="http://blekko.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blekko.com/', 'Blekko']);" target="_blank"><strong>Blekko</strong></a> is a new search engine launched on 8th November 2010, which is attempting at renewing your regular search quest. Rich Skrenta, of the Newhoo fame (now Netscape&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dmoz.org/', 'Open Directory Project']);" target="_blank">Open Directory Project</a>), has been working on this concept search engine since 2007. It works by categorizing the search words using slash tags (&#8216;/&#8217;). These tags are used to arrive at more specific results. This reduces the spam and irrelevant results.

## How does <a href="http://blekko.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blekko.com/', 'Blekko']);" target="_blank">Blekko</a> search?

Blekko has introduced the &#8216;vertical search&#8217; concept which allows you to dig deeper into a topic. Google is based on a &#8216;horizontal search&#8217; concept which makes your search wider than deeper.

When you search for a query on Google, lets say &#8216;Paris&#8217; you arrive at a page filled with information about the French capital, followed by few suggestions for Paris Hilton, shopping, tourism, etc.

Try the same on Blekko, this time with a slash tag &#8220;/people&#8221;, this limits your results to people named Paris. Further &#8216;/movies&#8217; to arrive at results with people named Paris in movies.Â  This method of slash tags reduces the irrelevant content which may have a similar name but is not what you are looking for.

## Features of <a href="http://blekko.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blekko.com/', 'Blekko']);" target="_blank">Blekko</a>:

  * Has predefined slash tags which makes it easier to categorize.
  * Allows you to filter out any search result by marking it as spam with a single click. This ensures that particular site will never turn up in your results again.
