These days social media is at its boom. Graduated? Upload your photos. Recently got a job? Where else can you tell all your friends and family about it just in one click :). I enjoy these social site&#8217;s update,comments and applications.

Being a **Facebook** addict I would not think of any other platform when it comes for social purposes. But I do not want to avoid **Orkut** all at once. After all being an Indian I started orkutting much before than I tried my hands on **Facebook** :).

Some reasons why now i prefer sticking to **Facebook** can be:

  * Starting from the look and feel, I think Facebook has a better UI (user interface) than Orkut.
  * We use social mediums to get in touch with friends and family, I think Facebook gives you more facilities to get to know what is happening in your friend&#8217;s life.
  * If I have to upload images or something I prefer **Facebook** than **Orkut**, for its simplicity and many functions.
  * While talking about **Facebook** and **Orkut** how can I ignore the Privacy feature <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> that makes me a Fan of Facebook. If you are using Facebook rather than** **Orkut you will stay away from stupid &#8216;Fraanship&#8217; requests :).
  * How can i miss speaking aboutÂ  the facebook games :), a huge time pass and a lot of times interesting too. Games like farmville, Poker, Mafia etc. entertain a user excellently.
  * Business wise if you are using Facebook, there are Facebook pages with an interesting graphics that help you exceed your business and promotion things. The &#8216;share this&#8217; option makes it really fast and easy to spread any news or data.
  * I really enjoy it when I can display a certain update to ONLY people I choose(custom select). If I do not want a certain person ðŸ˜‰ to see my post and rest of my friends should be able to see it, I can change my settings and do that too :).
  * Facebook keeps a check on you, if you are using your real name while making an id or not. If not then it can stop you.
  * I do like certain things like you can view how many and which users saw your profile on Orkut :).

With a certain amount of my friends using only Orkut I would not suggest leaving it all together but yes I enjoy **Facebooking** more than **Orkutting** :D.
