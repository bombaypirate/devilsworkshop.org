If you closely observe the trend prevalent online these days, it&#8217;s definitely all about minimalism.Â Minimalistic design, minimal work and all this in the least amount of time. If one online activity stood out like a sore thumb with this trend, it would have to be file sharing. We all have been victims of those moments when the file took a century to upload. E-mailing with attachments can be the worst nightmare.<a href="http://ge.tt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ge.tt/', '']);" ><strong></strong></a>

<a href="http://ge.tt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ge.tt/', 'Ge.tt']);" >Ge.tt</a> (no I haven&#8217;t misspelt it) is aptly named for the function it performs. Its a website which allows you to share files with others easily.

## How <a href="http://ge.tt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ge.tt/', 'Ge.tt']);" >Ge.tt</a> works:

  * Once you are at the home page, select the files you want to share.
  * While your file is being uploaded, a unique URL is generated, which you can share with the receiver. This link will be active for 30 days even if you don&#8217;t have an account with Ge.tt.
  * You may also email the uploaded file to the receiver&#8217;s email id from within the Ge.tt page itself accompanied with a note.

  * You can also view the number of downloads or views your file receives.
