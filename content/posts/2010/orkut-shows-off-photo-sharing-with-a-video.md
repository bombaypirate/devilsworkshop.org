Orkut has already introduced sharing of photos on its website. One great way to <a href="http://orkutdiary.com/tools/upload-images-to-orkut-directly-from-picasa/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdiary.com/tools/upload-images-to-orkut-directly-from-picasa/', 'share pictures on your Orkut profile is to share them directly from Picassa']);" >share pictures on your Orkut profile is to share them directly from Picassa</a>.

Sharing images is very vital for any social network and sharing them easily across the board is more important. We already use Twitter and Facebook without visiting their websites but actually doing so through their APIs on various websites. This is pretty much the same with photos which also you do not want to really share from just one platform.

Orkut also now allows sharing images through Scraps. These new and interesting features are being shown off by Orkut with a video on its <a href="http://en.blog.orkut.com/2010/04/share-your-photos-on-orkut.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.blog.orkut.com/2010/04/share-your-photos-on-orkut.html', 'blog']);" >blog</a>.

Here is the video for sharing photos on Orkut

The video also explains how you can not just upload albums but also share them with selected friends and also with email address of people without an Orkut account.
