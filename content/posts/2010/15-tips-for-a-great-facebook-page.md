Do you want to Market yourself/your brand or want to be known? In a world of social media, everyone is trying as hard as possible to be into some news by using online media. I do think there is a certain amount of how a person presents himself/herself in front of others which is very important.

And what else can be a better place to present himself/herself on social networking than sites like **twitter**, **Facebook** etc. You do need to present yourself in a way that interests people. Here are **15 tips** that may help a person or brand :

  * Always keep an interesting name for the **Facebook Fan pages**. Remember nobody would like to click on a boring name. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You <a href="http://fbknol.com/change-your-facebook-page-name/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/change-your-facebook-page-name/', 'can change the name as and when required ']);" >can change the name as and when required </a>so no issues in that too.
  * Pages can behave as profiles for **different brand names**. Earlier people used their Facebook profiles for promoting their business etc which was against the Facebook Terms of Service. A page can act as the best way to promote your brand or your self :).
  * Your fans can get the** latest news** by you. Imagine you have written a new blog and updated about it. It gets delivered to all the fan&#8217;s home pages just like feeds.
  * Facebook has improved its latest news feature &#8216;**highlights**&#8216; and news feed which gives every fan a better idea on what is going on.

  * Other **blogger or brands** can also join the conversation going on your Fan page and be a part of it. Sharing ideas is what makes networking sites cool :).
  * You should always try to start the **conversation**. From my personal experience I have observed that any reply posted by a Fan page owner makes the Fan feel good :).
  * Try to use a **unique image** on the fan page. The display image speaks a lot. If I would like to stand out I would choose a great image as my promotion plan. You should be extremely careful in choosing the image and it should be great enough to hold on to the user&#8217;s attention.
  * Ever heard about the **Canvas page**? Well it is the space given under header and left to the ads sidebar that is the space given to you to be used intelligently.
  * It is a general suggestion that any user should not be able to view the wall of the Fan page unless and until he is a Fan that is he has joined the page before. You should always try to<a href="http://fbknol.com/use-static-fbml-for-advanced-options-with-facebook-page/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/use-static-fbml-for-advanced-options-with-facebook-page/', ' send the user to join page if he comes to your page']);" > send the user to join page if he comes to your page</a>. It is important because there may be some conversation going on and you do not want a complete stranger to land into the conversation having no idea of it.
  * Being a Fan page owner you should try your best to keep your readers **engaged and interested**. By starting the new topic, sending notifications and replying to users you can be in touch with everyone. It makes a user feel important :).

  * Publish relevant and interesting articles. Keep your fan base interested and updated.
  * What is better than using some of the Facebook&#8217;s **application** including **events**, **quizzes** etc to keep the users busy. Who would like to end up on a plain page and get bored? Such events and quizzes keep the user engaged.
  * **Organize events** and tag people( your fans). Here you should keep in mind the privacy issues of users. Never tag someone who does not want to be tagged.
  * Try to avoid updating too many things about yourself and making a mess out of it.
  * If you find something interesting that your Fan has written about do comment or re publish it just as re tweet. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So, b<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">y keeping all these things in mind I think you can get what you desire. A good fan following, better internet image, better publicity and  promotion of the blog. If you have more ideas as to what should be done, do update me by your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>

How many of you have Fan pages and how do you manage them? Share your Fan pages and interesting things you do to keep the users busy.
