Facebook keeps me busy with changes and updates. Below are the two recent changes that I have noticed.

### Change in &#8216;Add as friend&#8217;

Yesterday my friend <a href="http://www.chaaps.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chaaps.com/', 'Murugappan']);" >Murugappan</a> told me about a new small addition being made. Did you see any difference in &#8216;Add as friend&#8217; ? Well, earlier it was all green and now it is Blue! Just like the color of Facebook, it has been changed to the same color. It looks more of a Facebook now. The image below is how it used to look before.

Here is the new image. All in blue.

### Change in Facebook Chat Feature

There is one more small change in Facebook, as told by one of my friend<a href="http://www.musicnlifestyle.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.musicnlifestyle.com/', ' Sauravjit']);" > Sauravjit</a>. Did you hear the sound it makes now when someone messages you? The chat message sound has changed.

These are some of the small changes that I got to know and shared with you. Some of you might have observed it and some of you would not have. Just making sure you all are updated with the latest news on Facebook. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
