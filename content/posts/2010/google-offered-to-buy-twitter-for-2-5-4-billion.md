Twitter I guess did not like it much and decided against it. Well this makes sense as Google can manage to make money out of Twitter and its search facility. Bing which is a Microsoft product has tied up with Facebook to create something called &#8216;[Social Search][1]&#8216;.

Apart from the initial hype over it, I have not met anyone who has really found Social Search all that useful.

### Microsoft too is interested!

There are also reports the Twitter was made an another offer for about $4 billion. That might mean, Microsoft might be offering them. Twitter against decided against it. I guess Microsoft wants to make sure Google does not own Twitter and vice-versa.

Well if I do let my imagination run riot and think that Google made it&#8217;s decision to buy Twitter based on [our post][2], Twitter should thank us for starting off a bidding frenzy for them. ðŸ˜‰

Jokes apart I do feel that at some point of time Twitter will be acquired unless its current owners manage to monetize and bring in a profit with Twitter. What are your views? Will Google manage to acquire Twitter?

Do drop in your comments.
