As China celebrates- The year of the Tiger, the Internet is probably celebrating – The years of social media networking! Twitter, Face book, Orkut etc etc. The list is endless!  How often do we grimace with the pain of logging separately onto each website? One workaround is to save cookies, but then again, we risk getting hacked!

With Google flooding Chrome with one extension after the other, Firefox users probably felt a bit lonely! However there&#8217;s good news for all the Firefox users out there, Mozilla offers a Add-on – **Yoono**!  Yoono is a social networking client that easily integrates an array of social networking websites. The websites supported by Yoono are :

You can forget the woes of manually logging in every time you open Firefox, as Yoono will ensure that you log in to the website of your choice once you authorize it. Besides this, it also posts alerts so that you remain updated. Although you can tweak the settings to disallow this.

The best part is that you do not have to keep going back to different websites, as the client synchronizes alerts for all the above mentioned services. You can blissfully concentrate on whatever you are doing and let this app reach out to you with your alerts!  Firefox users can download Yoono by clicking <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1833" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1833', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>. Here\`s   a snapshot, so you can see for yourself how Yoono integrates networking sites!
