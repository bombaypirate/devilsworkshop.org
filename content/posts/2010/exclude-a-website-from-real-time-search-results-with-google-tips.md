Yesterday I covered [real-time results with Google search][1]. The results shown with real-time are continuous as they are published on the internet. I feel this is great and I can even create Google alerts directly from the search page.

The only issue was if I was searching for a real-time results about a certain event most results would be picked up from Twitter. I did not like that and wished I could exclude Twitter for real-time search results.

## How it works!

  * It is quite simple. Just type in your search query and search for it. I searched for &#8220;***Cricket***&#8221; and got many results. Most of these results were from Twitter.
  * To exclude search results showing links from **Twitter **I just had to enter &#8220;***Cricket -site:twitter.com***&#8220;
  * Immediately the real-time results being shown had tweets omitted as search results.:-)

### Extra Tips

  * This trick works even with normal **Google **search results. This is a great way to search for something and exclude results from popular social networking websites.
  * This tip can also work with <a href="http://search.twitter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://search.twitter.com', 'Twitter search']);" >Twitter search</a>. For example search for &#8220;***#India -username&#8221; ****(do not use @username and use only username) *and you can get all tweets with India tag but a particular username&#8217;s tweets are omitted. Helps to omit spam. ðŸ˜€
