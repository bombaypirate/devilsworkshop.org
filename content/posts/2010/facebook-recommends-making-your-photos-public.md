This morning, I woke up to see new Facebook privacy settings on my Facebook account. Without wasting time I jumped to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy', 'new privacy settings page']);" >new privacy settings page</a> to discover Facebook&#8217;s new privacy settings (read confusion).

After brainstorming for a while, when I failed to figure out much from new privacy settings, I decided to check &#8220;recommended settings&#8221; by Facebook.

Have a look at following screenshot and as you can see below &#8211; **your photos are visible to everyone** in recommended settings.

Considering user-base of Facebook, many users will give &#8220;recommended settings&#8221; a try only to end up making their personal information, that&#8217;s too photos, publicly accessible!

*What do you think about this recommendation by Facebook? Are you going to make your images public or viewable by your friends only?*
