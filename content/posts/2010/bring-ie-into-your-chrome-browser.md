A couple of months ago you might have read about how [Google decided to make Internet Explorer better][1] by injecting Chrome into it.Â  All you had to do was [install Chrome frame][2] and Internet Explorer would be faster especially while viewing HTML5.

Now here is a new twist to it.Google through an extension allows us to inject a little bit of Internet Explorer into Chrome. ðŸ˜‰

### IE Tab

  * Add the **IE Tab** extension on your **Chrome browser** and start using **Internet Explorer** within **Chrome**.
  * Once installed you can click on the small **IE symbol** next to end of the address bar. (see image)
  * I liked using **IE Tab** within Chrome as I could **bookmark** my favorite sites in **Chrome** but they were added to **Internet Explorer&#8217;s favorite list**.
  * Also the **right click menu** within Chrome changes to **IE&#8217;s menu** withing the tab.
  * I could also access **Internet Options** from the tab which can be accessed usually only through the IE browser or the Control Panel.

I do not think that this one will be as controversial as Chrome Frame. But for people using Chrome and Internet Explorer this one should be quite handy. What do you think?
