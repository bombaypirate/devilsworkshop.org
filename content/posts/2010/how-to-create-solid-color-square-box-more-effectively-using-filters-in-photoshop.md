In this post we see how to create solid color box more effectively by using some filters. You can create this effect in simple four–five steps.

So here I show you the simple and unique box effect.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29958" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-01-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29958" title="img-01" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-011-600x244.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="244" /></a>

First create a new file in Photoshop. Create a solid color box in your work area you can take any color for box as you want.

The box is something as shown in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29959" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-02-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29959" title="img-02" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-021.jpg" alt="" width="493" height="396" /></a>

  * Here we see simple solid color box.
  * Now we go for our unique box effect
  * Select the box layer and look up **Filter > Noise > Add Noise**.  You can see this pallet as shown in image below.
  * I take Amount value – 5, and select Gaussian and keep Monochromatic on for this one.
  * You can change amount value or any more setting as per your preferences.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29960" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-03-3/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29960" title="img-03" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-032-600x413.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="413" /></a>

Now we have the image of the box with slight matting as seen below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29961" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-04-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29961" title="img-04" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-042.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="393" /></a>

After that we can give some another filter effect to make our box more descent. Go to **Filter > Brush Strokes > Angled Strokes **and you can see this pallet.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29962" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-05-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29962" title="img-05" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-051-600x325.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="325" /></a>

Here I keep my pallet setting as below **Direction – 50, Stroke Length – 15, Sharpness – 3**. You can keep it as per your requirement. Here we got the more effective box image.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29963" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-06-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29963" title="img-06" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-061.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="393" /></a>

Now we are go for some more effect for border edges. For this one go once again to

**Filter > Distort > Ripple **and you can see this pallet. You can set it’s value amount as per your image requirement.

Here I take Amount value &#8211; **-142** and size – **Medium**.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29964" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-07-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29964" title="img-07" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-071-600x349.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="349" /></a>

Here we convert our fine border in to Ripple edges. See the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29965" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-08-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29965" title="img-08" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-081.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="393" /></a>

Now we give some more effect to this one for more descent look.

Go to **Layer Style > Stroke **set it as per your image requirement. Here I keep this one. See the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29966" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-09-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29966" title="img-09" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-091-600x402.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="402" /></a>

We can give some shadow effect to it. It’s help the border to come out and be more defined. Our image looks more effective. Now here we can see how it looks.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29967" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-solid-color-square-box-more-effectively-using-filters-in-photoshop/img-10-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29967" title="img-10" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-101-600x367.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="367" /></a>

Finally we got our unique square box image more effectively. Hope you people like it.
