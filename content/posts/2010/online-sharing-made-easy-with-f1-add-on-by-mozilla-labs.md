Firefox is the browser of choice for me when it comes to blogging. I like Chrome a lot, but Firefox still has that huge number of Add-ons which makes Firefox truly customizable. Just a day ago I wrote about the[ RockMelt browser][1] which is a browser which I found useful for sharing links. With** F1 add-on**, Mozilla makes sharing on **Facebook**, **Twitter **and **Gmail **very simple.

## <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/252539/?src=external-f1home" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/252539/?src=external-f1home', 'F1 add-on']);" >F1 add-on</a> features

  * F1 makes it easy to share things with Twitter. It also automatically uses a URL shortener from bit.ly.
  * This add-on makes sharing links on Facebook quite easy, as the link was inserted automatically and I just had to type in my message.  The drawback was that I could not customize my link to be shared with only specific group of friends on Facebook.
  * Finally a simple Gmail button that lets you share the link of the page you are on and also write a custom message. I could also remove the link and simply write in an email. Gmail app account email accounts cannot be used with this Add-on which is a drawback.

The point is that <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/252539/?src=external-f1home" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/252539/?src=external-f1home', 'F1 from Mozilla']);" >F1 from Mozilla</a> Labs helps sharing quite intuitively. Also considering it’s a labs feature on Mozilla we might see this feature as a default on with Firefox 4. Hopefully by then this add-on will truly be able to help out a lot more.

Here is a nice video about F1 add-on.
