First time, since 2007  I am feeling really cheerful about being a BSNL broadband user! Why?**  
**

I went to office in the morning on 30th March 2010. And as a part of the same routine, I have practiced to reset BSNL modem on a regular basis to get uninterrupted Internet connection. But on 3oth it was something different! I started pinging BSNL DNS (which is also I do regularly to see terrible ping durations).

I realized that ping duration was consistent at 7ms! When I started downloading attachments from my email, I was stunned and shocked with joy to see download speed of 110 Kb/sec which used to be at around 60 Kb/sec. I could not believe my eyes but yes it was true. I tested this for almost a day.

Then I started searching all over as if there is something wrong with BSNL! That&#8217;s what comes to my mind (and I am sure it happens with many) when it is about them and then I came across the <a href="http://www.indiainfoline.com/Markets/News/BSNL-announces-free-offerings-for-its-new-broadband-customers/4804840579" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.indiainfoline.com/Markets/News/BSNL-announces-free-offerings-for-its-new-broadband-customers/4804840579', 'Source']);" target="_blank">Source</a> of this news!

> ***&#8220;Existing landline Broadband customers to taste higher speeds and enjoy fast moving virtually live games like cricket, it has DOUBLED THE SPEEDS for all its customers who have unlimited home usage plans with speeds in the bracket ranging from 256 Kbps to 1 Mbps without any extra charge upto ****26th April 2010.&#8221;***

Which simply means** that BSNL is offering double the speed of your existing Unlimited Home Usage Plan.**

As a loyal broadband customer of BSNL for such a long time (We had no other option) I was expecting but they did not send email to notify about it. Most of the users are still not aware of this new limited time offer and many users are not getting double speed even if they have Unlimited Home Usage Plans!

### **Few Pointers:**

  * I am registered for <span style="color: #000000;">UL 1350 PLUS</span> , which is a <span style="color: #000000;">512 kbps unlimited</span> usage plan.
  * I used to get download speed of about <span style="color: #000000;">50~60 kbps max.</span> for http & torrent downloads.

### **Now: **

  * ** **I am getting<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span style="color: #000000;">110+ KB/sec</span></span> speed for torrents & http downloads
  * Youtube & other videos are streaming extra fast.
  * I did few speed tests on speedtest.net & it showed me line speed of 1 mbps on most of the time.**

Here are few screen shots which might** **raise your eyebrows for sure, like it did to me. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />** **

My guess is that, since 3G services are very near to their launch, this could be a tech test happening for a month. And if everything goes well they might start giving this higher speed plans by default in the same price! I only hope that is the case. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
