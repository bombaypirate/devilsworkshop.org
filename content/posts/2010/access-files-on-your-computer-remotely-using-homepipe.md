Let’s say due to some urgent work you want to access the files of your office PC from your home. There is no other person to initiate remote desktop connection. Definitely it is not possible to connect with the office PC.

**HomePipe** is a free application which lets you access the whole directory of any computer from anywhere. You can also access the files in your mobile phone web browser.

All you need to do is sign up with the service, install a small application on your computer. During installation you have to fill the login credentials on the application window. A small Homepipe icon will appear on the system tray.

Now on some other computer, visit the HomePipe official website. Sign in with your user name and password. That’s it. You can see the whole computer directories on your browser screen. Click on any folder to open it. You can view files, documents, images and videos with the help of supported plugins.

This method only works if the shared computer is turned on, connected to the internet, and the HomePipe Agent running in the system tray.

It is easy to use, no hassle involved like other remote sharing tools. Also It is secure to use. It is available for Windows and Mac users.
