excerpt: |
  Wordpress 3.0 has been released lately and it was codenamed 'Thelonius' probably after a Jazz artist Thelonious Monk. The name 'Thelonious' also means 'leader of the people'. Considering Wordpress being a open source phenomenon this name seems to be quite appropriate.
  
  The name apart, Wordpress 3.0 has ringed in quite a few changes and added a lot of new features along with a much more viewer friendly default theme.

WordPress 3.o does have also the option of giving you a URL shortner with your domain name and has a new default theme called 2010 which is a pleasant departure from is previous default themes.
