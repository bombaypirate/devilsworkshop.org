We just informed you about <a href="http://wpveda.com/wordpress-3-0-final-release-is-out/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpveda.com/wordpress-3-0-final-release-is-out/', 'WordPress 3.0 final release']);" title="Wordpress 3.0 final release">WordPress 3.0 final release</a> and now it&#8217;s time to upgrade WordPress to the latest version. We will be coming up with lots of tricks and hacks related to WordPress 3.0, but before that lets update our blog to latest WordPress 3.0. Make sure you take a complete backup of your WordPress blog before upgrading your blog. If something goes wrong with automatic upgrade, we can easily restore to earlier version. We will be using automatic Dashboard upgrade feature to upgrade WordPress to latest version.

Login to your WordPress panel, and at the top you will see a notification which says WordPress 3.0 is available , please update now.

Though I will highly recommend to take a complete backup of your blog before upgrading and in case if you not comfortable with this, take help of experts.
