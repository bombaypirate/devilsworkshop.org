Every one around the globe is talking about FIFA world cup 2010 and how can we miss without any plugin in this occasion for WordPress.Â  Here is a wordpress plugin which you can use on your blog to show FIFA world cup live match score and Schedule. You can Show the World cup 2010 schedule on a dedicated page and also score of the match.

For those who have WordPress blog in Football or sports niche, will find this plugin to be very useful.
