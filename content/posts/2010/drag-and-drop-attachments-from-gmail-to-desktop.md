A few months ago Gmail introduced a new feature which made it very easy to add attachments by [drag and dropping attachments onto your email][1]. The feature was simply drag and dropping these attachments from your desktop or a folder on your compter onto your browser which had Gmail open.

Now <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/drag-and-drop-attachments-to-save-them.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/drag-and-drop-attachments-to-save-them.html', 'Gmail recently announced']);" >Gmail recently announced</a> that you can do the reverse that is move a attachment from your email onto the desktop.

This actually improves the Email experience and makes the usual Email clients quite useless. I like this features as often you end up looking at downloading or opening a file as a Google Document. This way I can just download it on my desktop and look it up.

If I want to use it for another mail, I just need to drag and drop it back into the mail I am composing. ðŸ˜‰

This is a great way to make a browser interface more and more in line with the window interface. Especially when it comes to handling files.

Lately Gmail has introduced quite a few changes including [rich text editors for stylish signatures][2], [Google Maps integration with Gmail][3] and [more][4].

Do try out the new reverse drag and drop attachments feature on Gmail and drop in your comments with your views.
