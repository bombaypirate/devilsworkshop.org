A few days ago I wrote about [@anywhere feature of Twitter which will revolutionize Twitter usage][1] for websites. This is actually a development forum launched by Twitter which anyone with a Twitter account to create and register a Twitter API.

### **About Twitter Anywhere**

  * @anywhere is like a call back function in PHP which will allow developers to include Twitter hovercards and suggested follow buttons on Twitter.
  * This basically means everywhere you see @username it will show up a hover-card with which you can follow the person from the web-page itself.

Here is a video by <a href="http://twitter.com/allnick" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/allnick', '@allnick']);" >@allnick</a> on how to setup Twitter Anywhere



Do let us know if you liked these features and if you will find it more easier to follow and retweet people much easier? I think this will increase the use of Twitter by quite a margin over the long term and its redesign plan would further enhance Twitter.

Do let me know your views through your comments.
