If you are following Google and their blogs for latest announcements then you might have read some incredulous news about Google and its products like Google changing its name and having a text only You Tube editor. I just thought I would review all the 1st April jokes Google is pulling off through its services.

### **#1. Google changing its name to Topeka**

Google announced in its <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html', 'official blog']);" >official blog</a> that it was changing its name to Topeka. What was incredible was the reason it gave. It claims that Topeka a town in Kansas renamed itself Google. So to return the favor Google decided to rename itself after much deliberations as Topeka.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-22729" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-april-fools-day-announcements/google_aprilfools1/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22729" title="google_aprilfools1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/google_aprilfools1.png" alt="" width="415" height="247" /></a>

So if this is not a April fools joke, then we might have to say &#8216;Topeka it&#8217; instead of &#8216;Google It&#8217;. ðŸ˜›

### **#2. Save money for You Tube with text based video**

This April fools joke is quite funny considering Google introduced a You Tube format called Text P with the caption that every time someone uses TEXTp mode it saves You Tube $1 per second of viewing. ðŸ˜€

It follows up with wishing all a happy April fools day. (see image below)

### **#3. New Google Wave Notification options**

Google announced new options with Wave Notifications through its <a href="http://googlewave.blogspot.com/2010/03/try-out-new-google-wave-wave.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlewave.blogspot.com/2010/03/try-out-new-google-wave-wave.html', 'blog']);" >blog</a>. I was a little preplexed considering only a few weeks ago they had announced [new notification options which I had written about][1]. On reading a bit closely it was apparent that Wave team was celebrating April fools day. It gives you the option of how loud you want the notification to be!

Here is the April fools day video for Wave notification that explains more in detail.
