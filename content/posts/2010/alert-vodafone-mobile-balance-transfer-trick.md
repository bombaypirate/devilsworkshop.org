If you have a pre-paid account there is a very good chance that you will be familiar with this situation where you need just Rs.20 more of balance to make or continue that one important call. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Vodafone has a feature which allows people to transfer Balance from one phone to another.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-34892" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/alert-vodafone-mobile-balance-transfer-trick/vodafone_balance_trick/"></a>I came across this tip, thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/warijit/status/16581499021164544" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/warijit/status/16581499021164544', 'Arijit Das']);" >Arijit Das</a> where I could easily transfer balance between two Vodafone prepaid accounts.

## Using Phone Number:

Just dial the following number. *&#8220;<phone number>&#8221;* is the the number to which you want to send balance to. Also *20 is the amount of balance transfered.

> **\*131\*20*<phone number>#**

<span style="font-weight: normal;">If you want to request someone to transfer to you some balance, you can initiate that by dialling the following number.</span>

> **\*132\*20*<phone number>#**

Here the phone number inserted will be that of the person who you are requesting the transfer from. This will send the person a message about the balance transfer.

I think more than a trick this is a new feature for Vodafone mobile users. Also be aware of balance transfer charges which are Re 1.00 per transfer.

Note: This works only when both the numbers are Vodafone pre-paid account holders.
