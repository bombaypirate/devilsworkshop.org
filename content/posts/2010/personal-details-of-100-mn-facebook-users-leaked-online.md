<img class="alignleft size-full  wp-image-50166" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/index.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="104" />Once again the facebook is in news for leaked details of it&#8217;s users. But this time it&#8217;s in a very large scale when the information of 100 million facebook profiles is available to download on net. This information was leaked by Ron Bowles, who&#8217;s an online security consultant. He used a code to search all the facebook profiles which are not private i.e you can read and access the basic info. He then compiled the list of all searchable profiles in a single file having the info like name and username of the profile.The list of profile is available for download on a popular file sharing website &#8216;Pirate Bay&#8217; where more than thousands of people have already downloaded it.

On this Facebook said, &#8220;No private data is available or has been compromised. The information of such profiles (having lesser private content) is still public and can be access by search engines like google, bing or yahoo.&#8221; Obviously the Facebook is right in this case but they got a warning about the privacy of it&#8217;s users for future.

> &#8220;Facebook should have anticipated this attack and put measures in place to prevent it,&#8221; Simon Davies, an official of Privacy International, said.
> 
> &#8220;It is inconceivable that a firm with hundreds of engineers couldn&#8217;t have imagined a trawl of this magnitude and there&#8217;s an argument to be heard that Facebook have acted with negligence, he said.
