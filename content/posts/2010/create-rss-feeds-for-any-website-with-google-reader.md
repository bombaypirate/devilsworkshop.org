I like reading blogs and following them. I do not usually visit the website unless I want to comment on a article. Hence I use Google Reader to keep track of all my favorite must read blogs. There are some web pages which do update but unfortunately there is no RSS feed for you to keep track of them. [Rahul Bansal][1] did review [Page2Rss which allows you to create a RSS feed of any webpage][2].

But I was pleasantly suprised that now I can create RSS feeds for any webpage through Google Reader.

### Google Reader

  * Log into your Google reader and click on Add Subscribtion.
  * Just enter the web page address which you want a RSS feed to be created.
  * For instance I wanted to check if Google India home page had a RSS feed, as it did not I created it with Google Reader.
  * So next time Google India has a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_logo" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_logo', 'Doodle']);" >Doodle</a> I will be notified through Google Reader.

*Here is a video of how this feature works.*  


I think this is a cool feature and now I can keep an eagle eye on any webpage I want monitor for changes. Along with options of [using send to feature of Google Reader][3], this one will surely make me stay with Google reader for a long time to come. What do you think about this new feature? Let me know through your comments.
