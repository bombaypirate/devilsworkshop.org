All of us keep an eye on Facebook. It is the largest social network and every little update makes a news. Now, where to get all the updates? I have sorted out some links where you can find all correct and latest news on Facebook.

<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/facebooklive/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/facebooklive/', 'Facebook live']);" ><strong>Facebook live</strong></a> : Here you can find the latest Videos, Updates, Innovations, Guests, Events, Demos on Facebook. You can also invite your friends to watch it. The best thing is that they give you the Live telecast of what is happening. When there is some new interview or meeting you get to see it Live on your PC at home. Nice !

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/facebook" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/facebook', 'Twitter']);" ><strong>Twitter</strong></a> : For everyone who is a twitter freak there cannot be a better option than this one. Just start following @facebook and get the latest inside details. ðŸ˜‰ It gives you the important updates and links to read them in details. I like this because its fast, precise and does not need a high-speed internet to catch up!

<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/', 'Facebook blog']);" ><strong>Facebook blog</strong></a> : If you interested to read in detail about the latest updates and the reason behind them then login to your Facebook account and have a look at the official blog here. Every update have been described and mentioned about.

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/FacebookIndia" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/FacebookIndia', 'Facebook India']);" ><strong>Facebook India</strong></a>: As all of you know that Facebook has opened its office in Hyderabad, India. If you wish to know information about Facebook India then you should go to this page and get the required info .:)

<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/blog/', 'Facebook Developers Blog ']);" ><strong>Facebook Developers Blog </strong></a>: If you are interested into knowing more about the developments going on inside Facebook then this is the place to be. If you wish to know about the features a bit deeply as in how they are developed and all then you will find such information here.

And yeah just to make it clear instead of going to all the other blogs Â you can choose to read it from here also.
