excerpt: Usually what I do to find font details like font family, font size, its color etc I open Firebug(F12) and start inspecting with it but becomes a bit time consuming, what if we get something that provides font details at just a single click. It can be done with the help of Mozilla extension i.e. Font Finder which provides font details in a pop up window.

Usually what I do to find font details like *font family*, *font size*, its *color* etc I open Firebug(F12) and start inspecting with it but this becomes time-consuming. What if we get something that provides font details with just a single click. It can be done with the help of Mozilla extension i.e. **Font Finder** which provides font details in a pop up window.

  * Download the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4415/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4415/', 'Addon']);" >Addon</a> and install it.
  * Restart your browser and you will find an icon at bottom-left in the status bar.

As you can see in the image below there is a font finder icon. Click once on it and then click on the font whose details you need. In a pop up window it provides all details about Color, Font, Spacing, Decoration, Transformation and Element.
