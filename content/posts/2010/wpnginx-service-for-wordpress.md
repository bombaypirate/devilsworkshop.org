Nginx is faster and easier to configure that gives you a better speed. You can avail this facility with our new service **<a href="http://wpnginx.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpnginx.com/', 'WpNginx']);" >WpNginx</a>**.

## Why Nginx?

We are running **30 sites** with **50K** total page reviews everyday from one single VPS and after analysing our server logs we can confidently say that we can handle another** 50K** hits daily without upgrading the VPS plan further, which is amazing. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Other than Nginx we have discovered many new ways to optimize our website&#8217;s performance and take it to a level where <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog/rtcamp-beats-google-in-yslow-page-speed-grades/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog/rtcamp-beats-google-in-yslow-page-speed-grades/', 'rtCamp.com homepage beats Google.com homepage in YSlow as well as PageSpeed like performance metrics']);" >rtCamp.com homepage beats Google.com homepage in YSlow as well as PageSpeed like performance metrics</a>. Any blog/site can avail this service now.
