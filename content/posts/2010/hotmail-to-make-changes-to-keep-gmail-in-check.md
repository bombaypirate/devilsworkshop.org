More than ten years ago when I signed up for an free email address, the first choice was Hotmail. I could use MSN messenger with the same user-name and password and not to forget sign-in to all the various MSN portals. The only other competitor was Yahoo and Inbox sizes were about 20 MB. **Gmail** set up free with supposedly unlimited storage space and freedom from the usual spam mail.

**Gmail** delivered and **Hotmail** faltered. So today Gmail is the dominant email service provider and Hotmail probably comes in second. Today Hotmail has announced that they will bring about some interesting features with Hotmail in the near future.

### Some of the changes promised by Microsoft

  * [Hotmail’s Inbox][1] will change quite radically with options like reading only mail from contacts which automatically shows only mail from your contact list. We can do the same with **Gmail **by creating a rule but having such an option with a click of a button can be quite useful. It also shows emails sent from social networks differently and group together as you can see in the image above.
  * **Hotmail** will also bring in a feature to allow documents to be opened and edited with new Office Web Apps. It does look like they are targeting **Google Docs** here, especially with is [new editing features][2].
  * A great feature of **Hotmail** could be to look up videos and thumbnails of videos from **YouTube** and** Hulu** which allows viewing of videos from within **Hotmail&#8217;s **interface with just a pop-up window.

### Will these steps help Hotmail?

  * These changes are something that mostly are already available for Gmail users. So maybe these changes are a bit too late. When innovation comes across while you are leading the race it actually makes more sense. Innovation done while catching up with competition can mean only keeping up with the leader rather than overtaking the leader.
  * Hotmail does target **Google Docs** and that is a cause for worry for Google as most people in general still feel comfortable using Office documents rather than Google Docs.

So what do you think? Will these changes being brought about by **Hotmail** be the **Gmail** killer or will it just be a passing trend?

Do let me know through your comments.
