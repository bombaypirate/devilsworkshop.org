Browsing through images can be a little boring and monotonous but there is an extension which works really well; using a 3D like interface for looking up images or even videos.

CoolIris is a extension which works on Chrome and you can just about browse any image online with its very interesting graphical browser. Before downloading the extension I need to warn you that the CoolIris extension does use your graphics card for rendering.

  * I clicked on a friends image on Facebook and I could browse all the pictures he was tagged in through the extension without needing to go through the album.

I started playing around with this extension and really think it is a brilliant way to browse images or videos online. It is said an image is worth a thousand words and going by that logic a video should be worth a million. So I decided to put up the CoolIris demo video.
