A simple tweet by Digg CEO Kevin Rose that Google was working on &#8220;Google Me&#8221; a new social network to rival Facebook has set all the theorists to go on overdrive wondering about what Google was planning to do with a new social network. Only a couple of days I wrote about [5 things Google might have got wrong][1] and one of them I included in the post was Orkut. From some comments it seems Orkut is still very much loved by our readers but the point I was making there is Google has little or so social presence even with Orkut.

Former Facebook CTO Adam D&#8217;Angelo also confirmed that Google was working on a Social Networking website which was to compete with Facebook.

This would set the cat amongst the pigeons as Facebook and Google rule very different parts of the internet and even thought Facebook is a behemoth when it comes to Social networking it is still not a very profitable company and this is what gives Google the opportunity to build a social networking website ground up rather than just come up with something new but not so useful vis a vis Google Buzz.

There are some obvious advantages of **Facebook** having competition. Recently most Facebook users were left to feel angry at Facebook&#8217;s privacy mistakes but there was not much anyone could do about it as if you quit Facebook there was not much of a competitor. Competition would make Facebook more forthcoming and far more careful with peoples data as they would also risk losing its customers. üòâ

What do you think will Google&#8217;s new social networking website be like? Would it succeed or not? Do let me know through your comments.
