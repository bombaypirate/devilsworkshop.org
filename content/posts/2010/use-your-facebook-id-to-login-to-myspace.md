Today when I logged in to my computer I just thought of checking out MySpace as in<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-has-a-total-win-over-myspace/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-has-a-total-win-over-myspace/', ' my last post I have mentioned about the new MySpace']);" > my last post I have mentioned about the new MySpace</a>. To much of my surprise I found out that the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.myspace.com/', 'new MySpace has a Facebook login button']);" >new MySpace has a Facebook login button</a>.

On further<a href="http://www.google.co.in/#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=new+myspace+login+by+facebook&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=15dc4102fbc35af1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.in/#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=new+myspace+login+by+facebook&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=15dc4102fbc35af1', ' Googling a bit']);" > Googling a bit</a>, I came down to a result that MySpace has totally surrendered to Facebook now. I guess MySpace has finally putting up his hands and saying I give up. Facebook is so far ahead of MySpace that, My Space has decided that it does not want to be a social network. What more is that it will now allow people to login to MySpace with Facebook Ids.

Any Facebook user, can login to MySpace using his Facebook id and password. Very soon Facebook users will be able to display their status updates on MySpace. MySpace also plans that whatever links people Like on MySpace will be shared on Facebook too. Â That will make people enjoy MySpace as well as stick with Facebook. ðŸ˜‰

The question is whether by doing this MySpace will regain its lost position or just let Facebookers have more freedom and enjoy. The thing is even if Facebook is good, it gives lots of options and everything should it be made to rule the world? Donâ€™t you think there should be some space left for other social networking sites? I think other sites should present themselves in a different way than just being a social network.
