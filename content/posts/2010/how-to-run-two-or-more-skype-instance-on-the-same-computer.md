I always prefer streamlining my personal and professional life and I do it by using multiple Facebook account, multiple IM accounts, multiple Twitter account and so on. We have already talked about how to run  <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-talk-hack-talk-more-much-more/" target="_blank">multiple Gtalk accounts</a> and <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/multiple-yahoo-messenger-hack-using-many-yahoo-accounts-at-once/" target="_blank">multiple Yahoo messenger account</a>.

In this post I will be talking about how you can run multiple instance of Skype using a simple software known as Skype Launcher. Though other way apart from this software is, create another user account in your Windows and run another Skype with that user credentials. But this Software Skype launcher is a light weight software which will let you run no no. of Skype messenger into your windows system.

Here is a screenshot of my Skype account and tested with another user account:

*Do let us know your thoughts about running multiple Skype account at once?*
