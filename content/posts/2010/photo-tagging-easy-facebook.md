One thing we all love to do on Facebook is tag the photos. This is the nice thing about it, you click photo, upload it on Facebook and tag it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Well now, <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=467145887130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=467145887130', 'Facebook has made it simpler by introducing tag suggestions']);" >Facebook has made it simpler by introducing tag suggestions</a>. Earlier we had to go through all the photos and tag them separately but now its all at once. It will bring all photos that are similar together and you can easily tag them up in lesser time. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
