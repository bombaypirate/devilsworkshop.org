Like every month we are sharing our <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/tag/monthly-traffic-report/" target="_blank">Monthly traffic report</a> here at Devils’ workshop and it’s always help us to motivate to do better. This month our traffic has increased by few thousands visits and we have increased the frequency and quality of our articles. More over guest bloggers started taking more interest and if you wish to blog at Devils’ Workshop, do read about our <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/posts-adsense-ads-revenue-sharing-program/" target="_blank">revenue sharing program</a>.

Here is  our monthly traffic report:

[<img class="wp-image-52435" style="float: none;margin: 10px auto;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/DWtrafficreport_thumb.png" border="0" alt="DW-traffic-report" width="504" height="298" />][1] Our traffic has increased by almost 20K but the downside is bounce rate.One major reason for high bounce rate is our top landing posts don’t have much related articles and we discontinued writing about certain topics. Though we are trying our best to focus on technology niche and if we exclude those top posts,our bounce rate is decent.

Anyways, here I’m also sharing our traffic source, this will help you to get more ideas about from where we are getting traffic and in case if you ignoring that part of traffic, you can always give it a shot:

As you can see most of our traffic is coming from search engine and organic traffic is always best for monetization and specially for Google adsense.

*I would love to know about your Blog traffic report for May and do let us know if you have any suggestion for DW.*
