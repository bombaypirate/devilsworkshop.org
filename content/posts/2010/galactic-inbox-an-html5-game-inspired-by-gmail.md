The other day <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/galactic-inbox-html5-game-inspired-by.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/galactic-inbox-html5-game-inspired-by.html', 'Gmail shared a game']);" >Gmail shared a game</a> inspired by Gmail called <a href="http://www.monocubed.com/?p=549" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.monocubed.com/?p=549', 'Galatic Inbox']);" >Galatic Inbox</a>. The game is the old style shooter game made famous on Atari and other consoles. This game was written in **HTML5** and does not use **Flash**. So make sure you have a modern browser. Latest version of Firefox or Chrome should do fine.

Try out this game and drop in your comments about your views on HTML5 and should Flash be dumped?
