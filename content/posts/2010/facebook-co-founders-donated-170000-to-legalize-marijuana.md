Are you in favour of **legalizing Marijuana**? Well there maybe people squirming at this suggestion and others might go hell yeah! This is under Prop 19 or Proposition 19 in the California ballot of 2010 that Marijuana should be made legal. **Facebook** has disabled all those advertisements saying about it. They still think it to be a thing that should not be displayed like this.

But people all over the world are &#8216;Liking&#8217; the **<a href="http://www.facebook.com/justsaynow" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/justsaynow', 'page']);" >page</a>** and voting for it. With hundreds of people joining and looking forward to it and Facebook banning advertisements, two Facebook Co-founders have made significant contributions to support the cause. Though they are not with Facebook now, and Facebook has refused to say anything about the contributions.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-co-founders-donated-170000-to-legalize-marijuana/facebook-marijuana-300x300/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-co-founders-donated-170000-to-legalize-marijuana/facebook-marijuana-300x300/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3088"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-54206" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/facebook-marijuana-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Image of Marijuana cannot be displayed or used in any case. Though the people can have their own voices and go for or against the topic but posting any such images is not allowed. **Dustin Moskovitz** has contributed $70,000 including $50,000 to the organization last month and **Sean Parker**, who was the first president of Facebook, has made a donation of $100,000.

There was an increase in the coverage of the news so Facebook had to ban all those advertisements. Whether it is a good thing to be done which may cut the crime a bit or allowing Marijuana will lead to more addiction, it sure can be a big discussion topic. In my case I do not support this cause. I am against legalizing it but I do not think people who are addicts should be treated as criminals. At the same time I am not sure if legalizing it will lead to more consumption.

With all such talks no body is actually interested into removing that page altogether. With all age group&#8217;s people visiting Facebook on a daily basis, do you think such Pages will be good? Do you think such Pages should exist? And are they spreading awareness towards something or just making a Page where people can comment on how cool is MArijuana.
