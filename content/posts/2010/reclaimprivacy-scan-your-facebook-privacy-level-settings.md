Facebook has been playing around with some privacy settings and recently they had also introduced the new <a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/05/15/new-security-feature-for-facebook-notify-if-someone-log-in-your-facebook-account/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/05/15/new-security-feature-for-facebook-notify-if-someone-log-in-your-facebook-account/', 'security feature']);" >security feature</a> which will alert you if some one tries to access your facebook account from someother computer device other than one which you use daily to login facebook.

Today we have another online tool which scans your facebook privacy settings and alert you about settings that might be unexpectedly public.

Just drag and drop the bookmarklet into your browsers bookmark bar and when you login to your facebook account, click that bookmark, it shows you a series of privacy scans that inspect your privacy settings and warn you about settings that might be unexpectedly public.

It shows alerts when your contact information or personal information is publicly visible and also rates scan using insecure, good and caution ratings.

This privacy scanner tool operates entirely within your own browser and never share your facebook personal data.
