Facebook is introducing lots of changes and new features around Facebook. [<img class="alignright size-thumbnail  wp-image-54639" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/facebook-beta-tester-150x133.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="133" />][1]As it is we are expecting lots of new products/features via Facebook using Facebook domain.

As announced by  Facebook they are working on a new product for which they are inviting beta testers outside of Facebook team. This is an excerpt from official page:

As a beta tester, your job will be to ask great questions and provide great answers about your favorite topics. Economics? Skydiving? Relationships? Mexican Restaurants? It&#8217;s up to you. You&#8217;ll be the first person outside of Facebook to use this product. Your expert writing will be seen by tens of millions of people — including job recruiters. And we&#8217;ll bring our best beta testers out to California to tour Facebook headquarters and meet the team.

So if you become one of lucky winners, you might be lucky enought o fly to California and see Facebook headquarter and meet Facebook team.
