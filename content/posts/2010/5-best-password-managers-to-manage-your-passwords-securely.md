It is very important to be safe while surfing online. No matter how careful you are while handling your passwords but passwords hackers are more smart than we imagine. Thus it is always recommended that you must keep different passwords for all your Email accounts, Social networking websites accounts and bank accounts.

But we have so many online accounts that it becomes tough to remember all the passwords. Whenever I forget my passwords I prefer to use [password recovery tool][1]. But instead of being careless, I started using Password Manager to handle and manage all my passwords safely.
