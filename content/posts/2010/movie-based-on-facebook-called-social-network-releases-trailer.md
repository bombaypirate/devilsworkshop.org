Finally a dramatic movie is out based on the rise of <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-creator-was-in-pune-india/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-creator-was-in-pune-india/', 'Mark Zuckerberg the creator of Facebook']);" title="Mark Zuckerberg the creator of Facebook">Mark Zuckerberg the creator of Facebook</a>. The movie is titled &#8216;The Social Network&#8217; and has the potential to become as iconic as the geek favorite &#8216;Pirates of Silicon Valley&#8217;

The Social Network was adapted from a book called &#8216;The Accidental Billionaires&#8217; by Ben Mezrich.

This movie is has been widely anticipated as a funny movie but the trailer seems to be quite intense. Have a look at its official trailer below. This is probably a step which will further immortalize **Mark Zuckerberg**. Point to be noted is none of Facebook and its staff were involved with the making of the move. ðŸ˜‰
