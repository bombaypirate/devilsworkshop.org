HP is slated to release much awaited webOS tablets in early 2011 for the international market. Meanwhile, 2 weeks ago, HP announced a brand new all-in-one touchscreen desktop **exclusively for the Indian market**. It&#8217;s called the Dreamscreen 400 and it runs on Linux based OS. It was expected to hit the Indian market at 25th nov, but has not been reported to have reached the markets as of today. The price is set at  Rs. 21,000 inclusive of taxes along with in-home delivery, setup and a tutorial for a limited time. HP&#8217;s main aim in creating a product for Indian families was to serve the kids, their parents and their grandparents sharing a household &#8211; sharing one device by keeping the interface and functionalities as simple as possible. Check out the official instructional video for the HP Dreamscreen.
