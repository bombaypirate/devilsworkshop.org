Facebook is always in news because of user privacy and another concern which keeps users in dilemma is security. We use lots of [anti-viruses][1], [Spywares][2] and tips and tricks to keep ourselves secure. But the shortest way to keep secure is by using encrypted connecting like using https connection.

[<img class="wp-image-51056" style="float: none;margin: 10px auto;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/googlebetasearch_thumb.png" border="0" alt="google-beta-search" width="500" height="160" />][3]

This is one of the reason I love Google and this is one of the reason people love Google products, because they come up with things which users are enjoying. Google [encrypted][4] search is something which is a new beta feature added by Google. Now you can search Google over https connection. You can use <a href="https://Google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://Google.com', 'https://Google.com']);" >https://Google.com</a> instead of <a href="http://Google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://Google.com', 'http://Google.com']);" >http://Google.com</a> now. So now sniffer software like Cain and Abel won’t be of much use.

According to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/search-more-securely-with-encrypted.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/search-more-securely-with-encrypted.html', 'official announcement']);" target="_blank">official announcement</a> from Google:

> When you search on https://www.google.com, an encrypted connection is created between your browser and Google. This secured channel helps protect your search terms and your search results pages from being intercepted by a third party on your network. The service includes a modified logo to help indicate that you’re searching using SSL and that you may encounter a somewhat different Google search experience, but as always, remember to check the start of the address bar for “https” and your browser lock indicators.

This feature is enabled for [Google web search][5] and not for other features like Google Image search, Google blog search and many more.  Just for the info this feature is in Beta phase.

*Do let us know your views about this new feature from Google. Are you going to enjoy encrypted search?*
