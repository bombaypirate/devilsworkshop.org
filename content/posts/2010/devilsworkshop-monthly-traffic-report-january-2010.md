We never published traffic report in past but from now on every month Devils workshop will be publishing its monthly traffic report. One reason for publishing traffic report is most of Devils workshop readers are budding bloggers and we want them to see what are the areas from where they can drive traffic to their blog. Another good reason to publish your monthly traffic report is, advertisers will have an idea about the traffic and exposure they will get while advertising with devils workshop and our blog network.

As you can see most of our traffic comes from search engine and because of that Devils workshop traffic is targeted traffic.

Soon we will be doing a complete redesign of Devils workshop.
