One key difference between the homepages of [Google and Bing][1] are the attractive images Bing search has as a background. This has not real bearing on a search engines functionality but a good looking background can catch attention.

So now Google has decided that they also would allow interesting images to be saved as background for their homepage. They have taken it a step further and will allow a user who is signed in to select personalized background images.

Here is an examples of such interesting backgrounds on Google.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-26065" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/customize-google-search-page-with-personal-pictures/customized_background_google2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26065" title="customized_background_google2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/customized_background_google2.png" alt="" width="550" height="365" /></a>

  * This customized background image feature is being made available to US users over the next couple of days. International users like me will have to wait a bit longer for it.
  * Users who prefer the plain Google layout can simply with a simple click opt for the white plain background with the search bar.
  * People can upload there personal images as background by using their Picassa albums.

I am sure once this is out it will also create a few ripples in the online community which is still a little undecided on [Google new layout with icons][2].

What do you think? Will Google resemble Bing too much or you feel this feature is long overdue? Let me know through your comments.
