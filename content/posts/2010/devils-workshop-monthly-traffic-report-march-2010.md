Last month when we published our <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/devils-workshop-monthly-traffic-report-february-2010/" target="_blank">February monthly Traffic report</a>, we were expecting to increase our traffic by the end of March 2010. Iâ€™m so happy to announce that <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/" target="_blank">Devils Workshop</a> monthly traffic has increased by almost 7% this month.

Like always our traffic source is Google and we have published 3 posts on an average daily. From this month we are increasing it to 5 posts/day, this means you will keep receiving lots of useful tech updates, tutorials, software reviews every month.

Here is a screenshot of our last month traffic:

  * Visits: 196,852
  * Page Views : 304,221
  * Bounce rate : 75.82%

The alarming factor for us is bounce rate which we will try to cover this month by more interlinking and adding relevant posts. Here is traffic source for <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/" target="_blank">Devils Workshop</a>:

If you also want to drive traffic from image search engine and have a wordpress blog, I will suggest try this useful [WordPress plugin][3] call <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-image/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-image/', 'SEO image plugin']);" target="_blank">SEO image plugin</a>.

*We hope we will see better growth this month in terms of traffic. Meanwhile do let us know about your blog traffic. How was your traffic in the month of March 2010?*
