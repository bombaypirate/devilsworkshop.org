VLC media player (Video lan player) is one of my favorite multi-media player because it renders most of the video and audio files without need of any extra codec. Be it, Windows or Macintosh, I use this on both the systems and I love it so far. If I have to select one multi-media player for my system, I believe it will be VLC media player.<figure id="attachment_25662" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

VLC media player released the latest 1.1 RC1 version which comes with few enhancements like:

  1. GPU and DSP decoding, depending on the platform
  2. Faster and more stable
  3. New codecs and HD codecs enhancements
  4. Webm and VP8 support
  5. MKV, mp4 and avi improvements
  6. More Extensions
  7. Important code cleanup and rewrite
  8. Interface and playlist reworked

Since it&#8217;s a RC 1 release, you won&#8217;t find this download link on the homepage of VLC media player. You can download the RC1 of V 1.1 from<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/releases/1.1.0-RC.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.videolan.org/vlc/releases/1.1.0-RC.html', ' here']);" > here</a>.

*Meanwhile do let us know which multi-media player do you use on your system?*
