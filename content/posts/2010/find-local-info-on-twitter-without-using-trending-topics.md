I came across this very interesting website which allows you to search for information from a particular location about a particular word. It is a lot different because it does not rely on trending topics. It is created by **Brian Cray** and has a great interface and uses **Google Maps** to show location based contextual tweets from around the world.

  * Considering the number of Tweets that get published on Twitter&#8217;s public time-line there is hardly a way to keep track. Following people is fine but in most cases when it comes to searching for something you need to look up trending topics.
  * But a lot of people do not trend a topic and many who do are actually more interested in branding their tweet rather than giving out something important. <a href="http://nearbytweets.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nearbytweets.com/', 'NearbyTweets']);" >NearbyTweets</a> looks up and searches for words included in a tweet sent from a particular location which you can put in.
  * Below is a screen shot of the Tweets I could gather with <a href="http://nearbytweets.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nearbytweets.com/', 'NearbyTweets']);" >NearbyTweets</a> by searching inthe location &#8220;**Pune**&#8221; for tweets on &#8220;**Web 2.0**&#8220;. I searched within **Pune** as this is the city where our office is located.

In India we are not very proficient tweeting about local issues but I think it will soon catch on. This would be a great way to search for recommended movies to watch playing in a particular town or city. It also can be a great way to search for Twitter users with similar interests in the same city you are living in.

Go ahead and try out <a href="http://nearbytweets.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nearbytweets.com/', 'NearbyTweets']);" >NearbyTweets</a> and let me know what you think about it through your comments.
