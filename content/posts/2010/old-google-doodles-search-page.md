title: Get old Google Doodles on your search page

  Google started using Doodles on their search pages for some fun I guess. But this fun started to become a tradition of sorts and many times while on Google we wonder what is next?
  
  Amongst all the Google Doodles there are a few which are my favorite ones. Like the one below from 2007 celebrating the 60th Independence day. I wish there was a way to get these doodles back on when I visit Google.com with my browser. Unfortunately the doodle comes with a expiry date as it is supposed to only celebrate something special on that particular day.

  * Favourite Doodle is a nice littler extension for Chrome. Just check out the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nedjejdfkkjgebciefdfofjhmeogiaga" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nedjejdfkkjgebciefdfofjhmeogiaga', 'link']);" >link</a> for it and install it.
  * Now when you visit Google.com, you can automatically click on the doodle itself to browser through a gallery of doodles from the past.
  * I liked that it was a comprehensive list. I could check all the Doodles from the past and found one I liked, as you can see in the image. Independence day for me is everyday I guess.

If you are using Firefox browser along with Chrome like I do, then to get my favorite doodle I needed a Grease Monkey script to be downloaded. Just download it from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmsearchscripts/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://code.google.com/p/gmsearchscripts/', 'code.google.com']);" ><strong>code.google.com</strong></a>. For using this, you will need **GreaseMonkey** installed on your **Firefox **browser. Look it up at our [GreaseMonkey how to guide][1].

Keep your favorite doodle as default on Google search. Do drop in your comments and views with any similar tools and extensions you might know about.
