We all love Twitter and like to follow interesting profiles. But what exactly are these interesting profiles? For me it is someone who shares interesting information. But at times you see that some people also end up sending 40-50 tweets in a single day and this can be undesirable, especially if the tweets are repetitive.

With **<a href="http://followcost.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://followcost.com', 'Follow Cost']);" >Follow Cost</a>** you can know the cost of following someone on **Twitter**.

  * **Follow Cost** calculates and displays the number of Tweets per day on an average and also displays the number of Tweets per day for the last 100 Tweets.
  * This is a good way to understand if someone is tweeting too much and hence might affect your Twitter time-line.
  * There is also another purpose and that is to check if the account is updated regularly. There is no use following someone who is inactive on Twitter.
