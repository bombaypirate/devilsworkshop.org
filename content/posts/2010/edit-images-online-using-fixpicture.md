<a rel="attachment wp-att-24821" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/edit-images-online-using-fixpicture/untitled-1/"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24821" title="Fixpicture logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/Untitled-1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>**Fixpicture** is a utility tool that edits your images without installing any software in your system. This is one of the most user friendly tool that is really easy to edit your pictures.

It is the free [online image tool that is used to resize][1][][2], convert the pictures or images even the digital photos into various formats like jpg, png, gif, nef, tiff, etc. It supports more than 400 formats. You can apply rotation, and some effects like greyscale, sepia, blur etc.

I think this is going to be the best alternative for many photo editing tools like **Snagit**, **Photoshop **etc. I feel this is the best alternative for these kinds of photo editing software and also there is no need to install this into your system.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-24822" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/edit-images-online-using-fixpicture/fixpicture/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-24822" title="fixpicture" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/fixpicture-600x335.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="335" /></a>

**As you can see from the above picture, here are the few things that you need to do while editing the images with Fixpicture**.

  1. Open <a href="http://fixpicture.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fixpicture.org/', 'fixpicture.org']);" target="_blank"><strong>fixpicture.org</strong></a>, then you can select one of the 2 options displayed over there which are <a href="http://fixpicture.org/flash/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fixpicture.org/flash/', 'Flash version']);" target="_blank"><strong>Flash version</strong></a> or <a href="http://fixpicture.org/index2.php?LANG=en" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fixpicture.org/index2.php?LANG=en', 'Html version']);" target="_blank"><strong>Html version</strong></a> (if you use high speed Internet go for Flash version)
  2. You can **resize** the image to certain size of **760px, 600px, 350px, 100px** and image size of **75% smaller, 50% smaller, 25% smaller** and also a **custom field** is given to enter your prescribed value.
  3. **Rotation** is your next option, you can** rotate** your picture or image to **90 degrees Clockwise**, **90 degrees Anti-Clockwise**, **Flip is vertical**, **Flip is horizontal** and finally **none** which keeps your image as it is.
  4. You can also give effects to your image with features like automatic contrast, Grey-scale, sharpen, sepia.
  5. Select your prescribed **format** and then select the quality of image as **good, better, best** which gives you the required **quality** of images.

This way you can have a versatile editing options for images from a website interface like [Picnik from Google][3] instead of a a image editing software.
