excerpt: |
  After that crazy Saturday night with all your pals, you post all those pictures on the modern version of a photo album – Facebook. It’s a moronic routine as everyone will go through the individual pages. What if we could personalize it and make a collage with some fun add-ons? All this without having to put it too much effort. Photovisi would be the perfect tool in this case.
  
  Photovisi is an online tool which allows you to make fun collages of your photos in no time. At first I thought its just another photo editing tool, but the best part is its specifically a collage tool and has fun templates to choose from.
