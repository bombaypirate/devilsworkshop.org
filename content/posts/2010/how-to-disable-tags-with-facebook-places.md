<a href="http://www.facebook.com/places/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/places/', 'Facebook Places']);" >Facebook Places</a> has been widely reported and a lot of Facebook users have started using it. One of its features is that you can be tagged by other friends on **Facebook Places**. Some people might not liked being tagged at all as there it highlights your profile to people who might not be in your friend list.

## Disable Tagging with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/places/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/places/', 'Facebook Places']);" >Facebook Places</a>?

  * Login to your Facebook account. Then look up under **Account **and **Privacy** **Settings**. (see image below)

  * Privacy settings opens a new set of options for you. Click on the Customize Settings link right at the end of all the options.

  * Here we can see the 3 sections with settings. Look up in the second section under **things others share**.
  * Here we get the option to customize which is named **Friends can check me in to Places**. Click on** select one **and we get a drop down menu. Select **Disable **and none of your friends can tag your on **Facebook places**.

This is a great step to make sure even your friends do not inadvertently share where you are on **Facebook**.

Do drop in any question you might have through your comments.
