I hate internet censorship and in my opinion blocking any website is more like stopping someone from acquiring knowledge. Most of education institutions doesn’t allow surfing social networking websites like orkut, Facebook, Yahoo and so on.  We have already covered few posts which will allow you to unblock any websites. If you missed it you can read about it here

Though one bad thing about proxies are they get banned very quickly and we always need to look for newer working proxies. The alternate solution to such issue is VPN and desktop proxy software’s. There are many working proxy software which helps you in unblocking and blocked websites and one of them is Ultrasurf.

Ultrasurf is a light weight desktop application which will let you browse through a different proxy server. Here is a screenshot of the working Ultrasurf software :
