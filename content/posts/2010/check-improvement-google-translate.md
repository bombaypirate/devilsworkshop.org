You might have not noticed about the few improvement Google has added in Google Translate this month. Google has developed automatic translation tools because they want to help people find information, no matter what language they speak. Below you will find three distinct improvements to Google Translate.

## Improvements in Google translate

  * **Alternative Translation :** Google has added the feature to see alternative translations, which can help us understand the true intended meaning of the phrase, and provide another kind of feedback for them(Google) to improve their translation algorithm. See the images below how you can edit the sentences, to do so left click with your mouse on the word you will get alternate words for that choose amongst it to use.

eg: 1

eg: 2

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/image_thumb7.png" border="0" alt="image" width="604" height="155" />][3]

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/image_thumb8.png" border="0" alt="image" width="604" height="157" />][4]

  * **Virtual Keyboard :** Google has also added virtual keyboards to Google Translate, because it is very difficult to type any of the 57 languages that is supported by Google Translate on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Just look at the below screenshot, click on the keyboard icon appears at bottom-right of the text area to get the virtual keyboard for other languages.

  * **Speech Synthesis :** One of the feature that user enjoy is to listen the text which they have just translated in other language. For this Google has added speech synthesis for **three more** languages and they are Arabic, Japanese and Korean. And dramatically improved another **17 languages** approximately, so that we can not only see text translations, but also hear them spoken aloud. Few of them are as follows Chinese, French, German, Greek, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish etc.
