excerpt: Everyday you visit a lot of websites, have you ever think of the web site you often visit has some SEO parameters. That will let you know about the Page Rank, Traffic, Pages Indexed, Backlinks, Bookmarks, Search Stats etc of your web page. Does it sound interesting to know more about it? Though there are many extensions to find SEO details but I am going to share the extension which I like the most.

Google Chrome has the best part that you do not have to restart your browser having hundreds of tab open to install an extension unlike Mozilla Firefox.

To obtain SEO details I find Google Chrome SEO an excellent extension that remains in the top-right corner and displays a clear list of all necessary details on a single click.

Download it and install on your Chrome browser.

## Features of  Chrome SEO

  * Every information is in separate row makes it more comprehensive.
  * Provides a lot more information than any other extension.
  * As you can observe in the below image every data is clearly shown.
  * Hides himself on a single click.

As you can see in the above image, Chrome provides all details precisely without cluttering the window and sits in the top-right corner of the browser without messing up anything.

Do you know about any better Addon, you can share your view through the comments.
