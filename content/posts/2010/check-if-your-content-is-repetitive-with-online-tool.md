Getting excited about something new is very good but sometimes that excitement translates into enthusiasm and at other times it leads to recklessness. This is especially very true for a blogger, as sometimes when I get excited about something new to share I get lost in the excitement and end up writing a post. After a few days I realize I could have added a few more points, maybe covered more things.Sometimes I am unhappy that because of my excitement I have written some words in a repetitive way.

The repetitive words are fillers and often can take away from the quality of your post. I came across an website which counts the repetitive words I might have used. Did you notice how many times I have used &#8216;repetitive&#8217; in this post until now? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### About <a href="http://wordcounter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordcounter.com', 'Word Counter']);" >Word Counter</a>

  * So you can see that I repeated the word &#8216;repetitive&#8217; 4 times. Ideally I should have not repeated this word more than 2 or a maximum of 3 times.
  * What I did was copy-paste the top part of this post into this website called<a href="http://wordcounter.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordcounter.com/', ' Word Counter']);" > Word Counter</a>. It checked the repeated words and gave me a list.
  * The website allows you to omit words like &#8216;if&#8217;, &#8216;to&#8217; which obviously will be repeated often

Hope you find this website useful, I certainly will be using it for a quick check on every post I write on DW. ðŸ˜‰ Improvement is a continuous process anyways. Let me know what you think about this online tool and if you think it will help you write better articles, posts or even reports.
