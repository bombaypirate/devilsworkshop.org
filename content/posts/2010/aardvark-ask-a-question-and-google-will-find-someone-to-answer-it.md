**Google** recently bought a company called **Aadvark**. I was wondering what it was all about and finally found Aadvark listed as a part of Google Labs. It has a simple system. Ask a question and someone will answer the question. Aardvark will fit someone who will answer the question. It also means with Aardvark you can answer some of the questions people are asking.
