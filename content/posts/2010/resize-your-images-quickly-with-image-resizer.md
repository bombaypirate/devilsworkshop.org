If you want to [share pictures][1] on your blog, social networking websites or send via Email, the major problem is size of picture. Images big in size might make your blog to load slow and many mailing clients don’t allow you to send larger images. Thus, you have to use software which can resize your images, but it is so time consuming that we defer the idea of sharing pictures with friends because you have to follow many steps like:

  * Open image resize software
  * Select the pictures one by one
  * Resize all the pictures one by one
  * Save as the copy

Even if you people think it’s time consuming than I am glad to share a very useful tool for resizing images.

**Image Resizer** is a Microsoft product and worth trying out. It helps you to resize your pictures just with a right click.

Open the folders of pictures which you want to resize and right click. Select resize image to resize your image.

<img class="wp-image-50244" style="float: none;margin: 15px auto;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/RightClick.jpg" border="0" alt="Right Click" width="506" height="336" /> Once you will click on “ Resize Image” , you can select different options:

  * Size of pictures
  * Make different copy of image
  * Resize original image
  * Custom size

Even if you resize your image, it won’t ruin your image quality.
