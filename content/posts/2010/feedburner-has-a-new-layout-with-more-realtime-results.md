Feedburner has a new layout. If you log into your **Feedburner **account you will see an option that reads &#8220;Try out New Beta version&#8221;. Click on it and you are on the new Feedburner UI.

The first thing that struck me was that the information being shown about the feeds was a lot more. Also with the new interface there is more emphasis on the messaging system which makes it a lot easier to keep track of issues with your blog&#8217;s Feed.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31906" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/feedburner-has-a-new-layout-with-more-realtime-results/feedburner_new_ui/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31906" title="feedburner_new_UI" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/feedburner_new_UI.png" alt="" width="600" height="605" /></a>

The User Interface seems a lot faster and cleaner. It shows a lot of data which is almost real-time. Like in the old user interface I could check feeds for every day. With the new interface I can actually check the stats with time-line of every two hours.

I can also check for traffic from sources such at Twitter and other social networks.

I am not sure how important would tracking real-time stats on Feedburner would be. It might help schedule posts more efficiently. ðŸ˜‰
