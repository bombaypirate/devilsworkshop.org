This one is not really a serious analysis of Google and Bing. It is neither a serious discussion about what these two search engines think about it. But I guess sometimes the truth seems to spill out unknowingly. Richie has published a funny post on [what does Google think about other websites][1]. Here I bring to your what does Google and Bing think about each other.

Google Search has a feature called Search Suggestions which drop down suggestions as you type in a query. Now Bing also comes with search suggestions.
