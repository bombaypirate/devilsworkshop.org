If we create a **service**, **business **or **blog **one thing that you really work hard for its brand names reputation. Before all this we look for a very simple to recall and unique brand name. Then comes the part where you need to start buying a domain, create social networking pages and accounts which will ensure you have all bases covered regarding the brand.

**<a href="http://ud.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ud.com', 'Namecheck']);" >Namecheck</a> **is a great tool to check how much exposure is there on the internet across all the major social networks, domain name availability and also if the keyword is a registered trademark.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29428" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/check-a-keywords-availability-on-the-internet-with-namecheck/namecheck_check_brand/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29428" title="namecheck_check_brand" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/namecheck_check_brand.png" alt="" width="514" height="537" /></a>

As you can see in the above image I looked my first and last name as a single keyword. I have used this **keyword **as aÂ ****across various various websites and social networks.

In the image you can see the **username **green boxes are all the services where that name is still available. The red box indicates the service which where the name has already been taken. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### Where this site helps?

  * It is ideal for your future plans or services you are going to launch.
