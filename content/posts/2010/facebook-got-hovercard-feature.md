Today I noticed quite interesting feature of Facebook. Facebook got Hovercard. Earlier Facebook announced that it is going to add Hovercard feature and finally it’s live.

When we hover mouse to our friend’s name, Interesting pages or applications, a small popup will appear which will show that how many of our friends like that page or how many mutual friends we have. Apart from Mutual friends, the feature also gives you number of Facebook users who “ Like” the Facebook application or page.

It is a great feature, you can even hover a mouse to an event and check out how many users are going to attend that event. You might also find new friends with same interest by checking out the hovercards on pages that interest you. As, the hovercard feature also lets you know about the number of Facebook user who “Like” the page, you will easily know the popularity of any application or page before liking it.

Twitter and Friendfeed already have this feature and now Facebook have also launched. Facebook might have copied the idea but I guess it’s worth copying.

*What you think about new hovercard feature of Facebook?*
