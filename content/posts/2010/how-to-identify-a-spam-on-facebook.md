  If I ask you why do you love Facebook so much, you have loads of replies to it. Its secure, better privacy settings, better photo upload, tagging and other options. But you sure miss the feature 'who visited your profile' which was on Orkut. Now, don't say No.
  
  One thing that I have seen on my friend's wall is "OMG OMG now you can see who viewed your profile" ,well that did make me wonder is it so ? Then the only thing we  miss on Facebook will be there. But the truth is that these things do not work. It is just a spam that keeps on spreading

If I ask you why do you love Facebook so much, you have loads of replies to it. Its secure, better privacy settings, better photo upload, tagging and other options. But you sure miss the feature &#8216;who visited your profile&#8217; which was on Orkut. Now, don&#8217;t say No.

One thing that I have seen on my friend&#8217;s wall is &#8220;OMG OMG now you can see who viewed your profile&#8221; ,well that did make me wonder is it so ? Then the only thing we  miss on Facebook will be there. But the truth is that these things do not work. It is just a spam that keeps on spreading.

## How to recognise a Spam?

The very important thing here is, any website, any download would not ask you and your friends to like it and spread the word if it is genuine. They do market themselves but not in such a way. If you are asked to send some link to a particluar people or when you download an application it sends update to all your friends asking them to download, then be sure this is a spam.

### How to avoid it?

Please do not like anything that you find online. Be sure to install it and try it and then Like. In many cases it asks you to first like and then they give access to download button. Avoid it all together instead of liking and then downloading and spamming your friends.

I have many friends who do not use social networks due to spamming problems. If we are careful while downloading and using applications then I am sure we will avoid such nuisance.

### How to remove it?

Just delete those wall posts if they are just on your wall. If it has already spread to other people&#8217;s wall then make sure to <a href="http://fbknol.com/now-control-what-you-share/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/now-control-what-you-share/', 'remove that application from your privacy setting']);" >remove that application from your privacy setting</a>s and apologize. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Although I want Facebook people to look for this spam I do want somebody to make  a Greasemonkey script for such a thing. It sure will be a delight to see your profile being viewed by how many and what people. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If I find something like this will let you all know. Till then keep me updated with what do  you think about profile views through the comments below. If you have any other post ideas or things you wish me to cover, post them at tips@fbknol.com.
