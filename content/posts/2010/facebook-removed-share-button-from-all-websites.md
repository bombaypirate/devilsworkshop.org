I was just going through some videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com', 'YouTube']);" >YouTube</a> and just when I liked a particular one and wanted to share it with my friends on Facebook, I couldn&#8217;t. Guess what, the **Facebook Share** button has disappeared !

When you like a particular video online and you wish to share it, you just have to go to YouTube and share it with your favorite pals online using share button. You still can share videos on Orkut, Buzz or tweet them.

## How to share anything without Facebook&#8217;s share button?

Well that is pretty easy, you just need to:

  * Click on share.
  * Copy the URL you get.
  * Paste that URL on your Facebook wall and click share.

Bad <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I know it sounds like that. We are so much used to Facebook share buttons everywhere that we almost can&#8217;t share anything without it.

Nobody yet knows that the buttons are being removed knowingly or just an <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-working-on-4-new-features/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-working-on-4-new-features/', 'accident like the one that happened some days ago']);" >accident like the one that happened some days ago</a> and Facebook was shut down for almost an hour.

We will keep you updated about this. Till then get used to the new kind of sharing. Do comment on this one !:)

[Update] The Facebook share button has been restored and working fine. Reason for this sudden disappearance is not yet known. I will update about it as soon as I get to know something. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
