Did you see any new feature on your Facebook Profile? Or lets say did you visit your friend&#8217;s profile and see something different ? Well there is a new chat box added on your friend&#8217;s profile page if he is online.

Thanks to **<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/muru0410" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/muru0410', '@muru0410']);" >@muru0410</a> **for bringing this to my notice. Now if one of your friend is online on Facebook, then you will see a chat box in his profile. If suppose you are going through profile pages of any of your friends and you find them online, you can start chatting from there.

Sometimes, your chat just doesn&#8217;t work so this can be a way to chat with your online friends. What say? Above snapshot is from one of my friend&#8217;s profile page. I could see and chat with him although my Facebook chat was not working fine. Well if the person has chosen to stay offline on chat you wont be able to see him online from here. So no privacy issues here. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
