If you are a professional web designer most times you will have tools or features in the software you use to write code to help check where code is different from another. But sometimes amateurs and also writers need to see the differences between two bits of text to quickly see where something was missed.

**diffChecker** is one such web service where I could upload two different text files and get any differences between the text of those files.

### **About <a href="http://diffchecker.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://diffchecker.com/', 'diffChecker']);" >diffChecker</a>**

  * **diffChecker** is very easy to use and the best feature of it is a novice can also use it immediately. Also there is no need to sign up or register with the website to use this feature. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * I sometimes write a post and then improve on it. To learn what mistakes I make at the beginning I tried to use this tool by comparing how much I had to improve upon.
  * This tool is ideal to check a backup file of a HTML code and compare it with another file you have been working on to see where exactly you might have deviated or changed course.

If you liked using this tool you might want to check on a web site which helps checking [if you are using certain words repetitively][1].

Do try out <a href="http://diffchecker.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://diffchecker.com/', 'diffChecker']);" ><strong>diffChecker</strong></a> and let me know if you know of any other similar tools by dropping in your comments.
