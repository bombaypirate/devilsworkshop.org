This is like Facebook will acquire companies that will help it to rise more and in a better way. It is always good to mix and match other things and help your company to do good. I think these mergers will prove very good for Facebook. They will work in Facebook&#8217;s profit.

What do you think of such mergers? Share your thoughts with me through the comments below.
