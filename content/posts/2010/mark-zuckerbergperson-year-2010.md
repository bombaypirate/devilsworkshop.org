Yes, it is right. Mark Zuckerberg is named as the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2037183,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2037183,00.html', 'person of the year 2010 by TIMES']);" >person of the year 2010 by TIMES</a>. There are talks<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ThisMustBeHeard/status/15075878744629248" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/ThisMustBeHeard/status/15075878744629248', ' for']);" > for</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DarrinJWard/status/15276740054089728" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/DarrinJWard/status/15276740054089728', 'against it']);" >against it</a>.

Being 26 years old and owning a company that has more than 500 million users is not a small thing. Is it? Recently Facebook Inc. was declared as <a href="http://fbknol.com/survey-place-work-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/survey-place-work-facebook/', 'the best place to work by Glassdoor.com']);" >the best place to work by Glassdoor.com</a> . With the smallest change like changing the sound of Facebook chat to making a <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-profile-designs-screenshots/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-rolled-out-new-profile-designs-screenshots/', 'change in the Facebook profile']);" >change in the Facebook profile</a>, everything has been hugely covered on news, blogs and everywhere.

His way of seeing the World as a big open platform to share news, photos, updates etc is coming true. Recently a <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-friendships-world-map/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-friendships-world-map/', 'Facebook engineer made a map of Facebook Friendships around the world']);" >Facebook engineer made a map of Facebook Friendships around the world</a>. People are using Facebook to share their emotions, feelings or almost everything! I think he gave us a platform to make sharing a hell lot of easier.

There are privacy issues at times, people are skeptical about their privacy like who will read what, but I guess  this is the main thing about Facebook. Dont you think so? To make the world an open place to be. In short I don&#8217;t think Facebook is for people who don&#8217;t want to share things. You can hide a number of things if you wish to. That much freedom is given ! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But why cry for privacy every moment?

Well, I am happy with it, I think he deserves it. What do you think? Feel free to share your views through the comments below.
