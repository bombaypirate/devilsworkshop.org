I often read Wikipedia for finding some interesting facts. Most times it is to get some basic background about certain things. Most articles will include a lot of information like the correct way to pronounce certain words.

It also has links to a particular query&#8217;s ambiguous meanings. This can be a little too much for children or for people who do not know English as their first language.

## Getting Wikipedia articles in simple English

  * Let&#8217;s say I am reading an article about India on Wikipedia. The URL will beÂ  ***http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India .***
  * *** ***To get the same article in simple English just replace &#8220;en&#8221; with &#8220;simple&#8221;.
  * So the URL will be ***http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/India. ***

This gives the same content in simplified English which does remove a lot of information which people might not really be interested in.

I do not think most people will find Wikipedia articles are too difficult to understand. But this is really useful if you are learning English or for students who might find the language of a particular article too difficult.

Do you think Wikipedia needs more such filters? Do drop in your comments?
