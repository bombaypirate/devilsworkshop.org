Have you heard about **ASCII art**? You would have seen on **Facebook **status updates or wall posts, that some people create images or text using characters like &#8216;,&#8221;,~,! etc. I always wondered how do they manage to do this?

Well here is the solution. Now you can create any type of ASCII art no matter if it&#8217;s an image or a text. You can save it in your notes or use it. Below are some of the links to such sites that create ASCII art for you. You just have to enter the image URL or the text and get the ASCII art.

  * <a href="http://www.asciiarts.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.asciiarts.net/', 'Facebook ASCII Art Generator']);" >Facebook ASCII Art Generator</a>: Here you can get an ASCII image or ASCII text as you wish. You just have to type the original text and get the ASCII art. The art produced is 75 characters in length.
  * <a href="http://photo2text.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://photo2text.com/', 'For just creating an image']);" >For just creating an image</a>: If you want to change your image to an ASCII characters image you can get it done here. You just need to upload the image and click send. Along with the image you can get it inverted also. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * <a href="http://patorjk.com/software/taag/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://patorjk.com/software/taag/', 'Different types of letters']);" >Different types of letters</a>: I had always wondered how people get dancing fonts, big cursive fonts or just a plain big designer font. You know what here you can get it all done. There&#8217;s a variety to choose from. You can change the way a particular text looks, you can change the color and what not. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * <a href="http://www.network-science.de/ascii/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.network-science.de/ascii/', 'Generate graphical ASCII']);" >Generate graphical ASCII</a>: If you wish to have a graphical ASCII art then you need to choose this site. With wide variety of styles you can choose the alignment and reflection also. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * <a href="http://www.typorganism.com/asciiomatic/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.typorganism.com/asciiomatic/', 'Coloured ASCII Art']);" >Coloured ASCII Art</a>: Here you can upload an image and can have a black and white, squared, letters and colored ASCII generated for it.

I like all the above online ASCII Art generators. You can choose from the sites based on what you want. Now I do not have to copy and paste other&#8217;s status updates rather can have a mine! What do you think? Do you know of any other ASCII generators?
