title: Send yourself an email reminder with Nudge Mail

excerpt: |
  To set reminders in the future I use Google Calendar. With Google Calendar I can make sure that I get reminders sent on Gmail or even through SMS. But this is a little tedious and I needed a quicker and faster way to set-up reminders. For instance I have to call someone at a particular time, opening up your Google Calendar for that is a little tedious.
  
  This is where Nudgemail can be very useful.

  * Register your email address with NudgeMail from their homepage.
  * Now send in a reminder to yourself with an email. Just type in a reminder message in the body of the email and send the message to the following address.

> **nudge@nudgemail.com**

  * In the subject type in when the reminder has to be sent. I typed in 10 minutes and I received a reminder in 10 minutes. I could also send reminders with subject line as &#8220;**Tomorrow**&#8220;, &#8220;**Nov 20**&#8221; and more.

  * Another way to use service is to use the different email address to set reminders. This is where I can use &#8220;**tomorrow@nudgemail.com**&#8221; and the reminder message can be left as the subject of the email.

There are a few more tips on using NudgeMail at their &#8220;<a href="http://www.nudgemail.com/how/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nudgemail.com/how/', 'how to']);" >how to</a>&#8221; page.

I found this service really useful for setting important yet mundane reminders. Most times I use this to remind myself that I need to call someone on their birthdays. Do try out NudgeMail and drop in your comments and views.
