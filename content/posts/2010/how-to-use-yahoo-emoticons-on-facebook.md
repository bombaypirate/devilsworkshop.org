I have always felt jealous by the Yahoo emoticon&#8217;s look and feel and the way there are more options there. Have you ever tried to update your **<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-have-a-cool-status-update-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-have-a-cool-status-update-on-facebook/', 'Facebook status']);" >Facebook status</a>** or send an emoticon to someone on their wall? It appears as a simple text smiley. Well now you can get your favorite <a href="http://fbknol.com/list-of-facebook-chat-emoticons-to-spice-up-the-chat/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/list-of-facebook-chat-emoticons-to-spice-up-the-chat/', 'emoticons on Facebook']);" >emoticons on Facebook</a>. You just need to install this <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89124" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89124', 'Greasemonkey script']);" >Greasemonkey script</a> and see the magic happen. ðŸ˜‰

## How to install?

  * You should have Greasemonkey script installed on your Mozilla Firefox. If not then install it from<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/', ' here']);" > here</a>.
  * Go <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89124" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89124', 'here']);" >here</a>.
  * Install the script.
  * Refresh your browser.

Only bad thing about it is that the smileys are shown on you Facebook not on somebody else&#8217;s. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But well better than not showing any thing at all.

Now try updating your status or sending anybody any smiley, you will see the new bigger and better smileys. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> In the image above I am using an emoticon that is available with only Yahoo.

Try using this and tell me how did you find them? If you know of any other such script or similar one feel free to share it with me through the comments.
