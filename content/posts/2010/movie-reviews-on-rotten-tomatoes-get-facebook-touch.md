Do you also surf several sites for **movie reviews** but at the end do not forget to ask your friend&#8217;s review? No matter what we do last word is of our friend&#8217;s. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> While this morning I was going through **<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rottentomatoes.com', 'Rotten tomatoes']);" >Rotten tomatoes</a>** a famous movie review site, I had a totally different experience.

It was all personalised for me. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Rotten Tomatoes has integrated **Facebookâ€™s Instant Personalization** so that you can get movie recommendations from your friends.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/screenshot_007-5/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/screenshot_007-5/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2724"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-54184" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/screenshot_0074.png" alt="" width="549" height="69" /></a>

Now Rotten tomatoes show you the movie reviews according to your friends &#8216;**Likes**&#8216;

<a href="http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/screenshot_005/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/screenshot_005/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2725"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2725" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/screenshot_005.png" alt="" width="274" height="84" /></a>

It shows an option saying how many friends like a particular movie

<a href="http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/screenshot_006/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/screenshot_006/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2726"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2726" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/screenshot_006.png" alt="" width="268" height="89" /></a>

It also tells you which of your friends want to watch a particular movie(so that if you are also inetersted in watching the same movie why not go together ðŸ˜‰ ) and which movies they like.

All in all it is a great way of having your friends reviews on the movies. What do you think? Feel free to share your views with me from your comments.
