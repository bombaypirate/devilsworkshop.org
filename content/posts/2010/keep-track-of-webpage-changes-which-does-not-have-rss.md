Some pages on the internet are made by people who do not really want to engage with other proactively. As a blogger you cannot image someone writing a blog or creating a website without any RSS feeds. Most websites which are popular absolutely support RSS feeds but sometimes some websites which I might feel important and want to follow changes to do not have RSS feeds. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This is where I liked <a href="http://www.changedetection.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.changedetection.com/', 'Change Detection']);" >Change Detection</a> a website to keep updated about changes.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29268" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/keep-track-of-webpage-changes-which-does-not-have-rss/change_detection/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29268" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="change_detection" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/change_detection.png" alt="" width="550" height="200" /></a>

### Features of <a href="http://www.changedetection.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.changedetection.com', 'Change Detection']);" >Change Detection</a>

  * Just enter the name of the website which you want to monitor changes to and also enter the email address to which the alert is sent.
  * Practical use can be to actually monitor a change of policy in a company or stay updated if a software you are using has newer version. ðŸ˜‰
  * It can also double up as **Google **alert but I have not tested it much. Still feel Google alerts works great.

Previously I had written about how to use [Google Reader to create rss feeds of any page][1] which can also be used to monitor a website and changes it has. **<a href="http://www.changedetection.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.changedetection.com', 'Change Detection']);" >Change Detection</a> **is better in the sense I do not need to your Google Reader! ðŸ˜€

Do you monitor any website without **RSS**? Do let me know your views through your comments.
