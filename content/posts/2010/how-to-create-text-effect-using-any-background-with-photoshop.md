We see many options and examples of Text Effect in Photoshop. In this tutorial I will share that how to create text effect by using any background.

Here I have this image of grass and I am going to create text effect on it as you can see in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30123" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-text-effect-using-any-background-with-photoshop/image1-6/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30123" title="image1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image1-600x317.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="317" /></a>

First settle down on an image. I selected the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30124" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-text-effect-using-any-background-with-photoshop/image2-3/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30124" title="image2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image2-600x317.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="317" /></a>

Go to tool bar and select the Type Tool. You can use shortcut also just Press **T** key on your keyboard.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30125" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-text-effect-using-any-background-with-photoshop/image3-1/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30125" title="image3-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image3-1.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="155" /></a>

Then type in the text which you want. Make sure to have the text big sized and bold. If you take smaller fonts, the text effect may not show up properly.<a rel="attachment wp-att-30126" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-text-effect-using-any-background-with-photoshop/image3-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30126" title="image3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image3-600x320.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="320" /></a>

We have one image and two layers. One is the background or the grass layer. The other one is the text layer.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30127" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-text-effect-using-any-background-with-photoshop/image4-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30127" title="image4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image4-600x317.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="317" /></a>

### Creating Grass Effect to the text.

  * First select the background image layer and duplicate the layer.
  * For duplicating the layer just select the background layer and right-click on the layer in layer palate.
  * You can see this palate and click on duplicateÂ  layer. *(You can also use shortcut for this one just press Ctrl+J.)*

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30128" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-text-effect-using-any-background-with-photoshop/image5-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30128" title="image5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image5.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="273" /></a>

  * A box will pop to prompt you to duplicate the background layer as a copy. Click on OK.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30129" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-create-text-effect-using-any-background-with-photoshop/image6-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30129" title="image6" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image6.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="336" /></a>

  * Here we have two layers of background image. Now what we will do is select the text layer and then make an selection on the layer itself.

  * For selection just go into layer palate and hold **Ctrl** key and click on text layer&#8217;s white area as shown in image below.

  * After making selection on text layer go to **Select >>Inverse** and then click on it.
  * Now select the background copy layer which was below the text layer.
  * Now when we click Inverse and select background copy layer.

  * We have three layers now and we need to hide the text and main background layers.
  * For hiding the layer go to layer palate and just click on eye icon of the layer.
  * We can see the background grass image cut out in the shape of the text. *( S**ee the image below)*

  * Now we give more style to the text layer. Goto the layer palate and click style icon at the bottom of the palate. *(See the below image)*

Go to the layer pallet and on the main background layer which was hidden all this while. Here we have our image.
