Many people log in to **Facebook **for its games. **Farmville **is one of the most popular games on **Facebook**. **Farmville** is a great way to pass time. It allows its users to virtually manage farms including harvesting, seeding, managing animals and constructing buildings.

Number of **FarmVille **users are over **10%** of the users of **Facebook**. I have been a **Farmville **addict for one year and thought I would share some of the tips I used to get ahead in Farmville. ðŸ˜‰

  1. Usually people forget when their crops are getting ready for **harvesting**. ðŸ˜€ A better idea is to try to sow different crops but of same harvest time and try to finish their mastery.
  2. If you want to earn money fast and you stay online a lot then sow berries as they take less time and give you good money. ðŸ˜‰
  3. If you are not online regularly then crops like corn or potato are excellent as they take 2-3 days to get harvested.
  4. Do not just concentrate on getting more cash,very soon you will be frustrated. Do not waste farm cash because you wont get farm cash very easily. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  5. Always send gifts and receive gifts. Help your **neighbors **and get helped in return.
  6. If you want to send some thing that&#8217;s not available in your free gift section but available in some body else&#8217;s then try sending any gift and look at the URL and just change the last word of it. **Example:** If you want to send a banana tree instead of any other tree replace the name byÂ any other tree to banana tree this helps while completing collections.
  7. All animals and trees should be harvested at one time. Wait for all of them to get ready as that saves time and energy. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  8. Use fence to manage your animals or else they start running around and creating a mess. Save your time. Click on stay on all the animals and please lock your avatar in haystacks or else he/she will take a lot of time in seeding.
  9. If you have money buy a tractor that saves time and fast output. Try to arrange a tractor, seeder etc and one tree/animal of each kind .
 10. Save the gifts in the box do not keep opening them repeatedly once you get the mastery of all gifts.
 11. You can select people (customize) who should be able to see free stuff or bonuses. This is better if you want to share bonus with people who share with you and not everyone.
 12. Please do not download any tools that play on Farmville even while you are offline. Most times such software cannot be trusted.

Remember there is no cheat code in **Farmville**, the more you play the more you find new ways to level up and stuff. I hope these tips help you and if you have any more tricks you are free to share it with me through comments.
