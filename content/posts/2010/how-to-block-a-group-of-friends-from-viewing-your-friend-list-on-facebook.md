**Facebook** is a social networking website where people are always searching different ways to **secure** their account. You might be having different sets of friends that is your colleagues, your college friends or your family friends. In that case you don&#8217;t want the acquaintances to get mixed up. We can create different lists according to our choice and apply them wherever we wish to.

### How to create a List on Facebook ?

Click on Friends (It is present on the upper left hand side just under your profile picture).

You can see on upper right hand side of the page &#8216;**Create a List**&#8216;.

Once you have clicked the button, you are asked to enter the name of the list and select the people who you want to enter in that list.

Once you are done, click on &#8216;**Save List**&#8216;.

### How to block a group of friends from viewing your friend list ?

Go to the **Privacy settings** of your account.

Click on **View settings**.

Once you are inside the **Basic directory information**, try to change the friends that can view your friend list.

It may be selected as &#8216;**everyone**&#8216; so click there and a drop down menu appears.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-block-a-group-of-friends-from-viewing-your-friend-list-on-facebook/screenshot_022/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-block-a-group-of-friends-from-viewing-your-friend-list-on-facebook/screenshot_022/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2615"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2615" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/screenshot_022.png" alt="" width="550" height="96" /></a>

Click on **Custom(edit)**.

Change it to Specific people. You see two text boxes, one saying &#8216;**Make visible to these people**&#8216; and the other saying &#8216;**Hide this from**&#8216;.

Go to the other text box and write the name of your friend list which has a group of people whom you do not want to show the friend list.

Click &#8216;**Save setting**&#8216;.

Here I have used the List name as **General** and included some of my friends whom I do not want to show my **friend list**.

Hope this post helped you a bit. If you know any other way of protecting your friend list, do let me know with your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
