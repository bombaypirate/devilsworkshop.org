When I do blog hopping, I usually subscribe to other blogs both via RSS or Email. Subscribing to other blogs is a good practice of being informed on what’s happening on the web. Here, I am going to explain on my own point of view why subscribing to blogs is essential for a blogger.

1. **Know the Latest** – You are always receiving the latest updates on a particular niche. Thus, you always have something to share on your own blog based from what you’ve read.

2. **Remember the Blog** – If you visit a particular blog and found something interesting, let’s say a well-written tutorial, you will definitely love visiting that blog again. If you don’t subscribe to RSS or Email, sometimes it will take time for you to find the blog especially if there are lot of competing blogs on a particular topic.

3. **Read Blog Posts Even the Website is down** – There are some cases in which a website is down either by hosting company or just some technical errors. If you just bookmarked the website or blog, of course you can’t load the page. But if you subscribe to RSS, in most cases you can still read the feeds.

4. **Be the First to Comment** – When a blog post is published, it will eventually be delivered via Email depending on scheduling; or your RSS reader is updated with the latest post. As a subscriber, you will also be the first commenter and is more visible to other audience.

5. **Inform the Author** – Some bloggers usually don’t subscribe to their own RSS or Email. Thus, they missed checking if the RSS or Email delivery has technical problems or not. As a subscriber, you can easily spot it. You can notify then the author and be recognized.

There might be other reasons why you should really subscribe to other blogs. Meanwhile don&#8217;t forget to subscribe to [devils&#8217; Workshop RSS feeds][1]. If you can add more, let’s talk it on the comment section.
