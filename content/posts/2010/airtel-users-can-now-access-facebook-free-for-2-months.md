Bharti Airtel has  <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infotech/internet/Free-facebook-access-for-Airtel-users-for-two-months/articleshow/6130365.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infotech/internet/Free-facebook-access-for-Airtel-users-for-two-months/articleshow/6130365.cms', 'made']);" target="_blank">made</a> accessing Facebook free for its subscribers, albeit for a two month period. The move tops almost every other option available for accessing facebook on mobile for free. If you remember, Facebook had recently launched a very basic version 0.facebook.com primarily for mobile access for free. Using o.facebook.com users can access their facebook accounts, view and update status messages without incurring any data charges. However, there was one little problem with this – o.facebook.com does not provide viewing and updating of images. So, if anyone wants to view and update images via o.facebook.com, data charges apply.

However, Airtel has gone one up and actually provided free access to m.facebook.com itself, the mobile version of Facebook. What this means is that Airtel users can get the complete experience including images at no extra cost. The service is free for 2 months and will last till August 31.

**How to access m.facebook.com for free on Airtel**

If you are already use mobile internet on your Airtel connection, all you need to do is log on to m.facebook.com and start accessing your facebook account without worrying about data charges.

If you are going to use mobile internet for the first time on your Airtel connection, here are the steps you need to follow,

  * SMS ‘FACEBOOK’ to 54321
  * Enter your e-mail address and password
  * That’s it. You can start browsing your facebook account using m.facebook.com without paying a single penny during July and August

This sure looks like a win-win move for Airtel and Facebook. Facebook has a huge user base in India and with Airtel providing free access for limited time, it can both result in increase in subscribers for Airtel and also increased adoption of its mobile internet services which will go a long way in increasing revenues for Airtel.
