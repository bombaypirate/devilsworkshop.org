Remember Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean and his strange way of speaking English? Now on Facebook you can start speaking like a pirate with their strange language. Take a look below at my Facebook profile page and I will tell you how you can also your page to look like this.

As many know that Facebook supports quite a few languages and this is where Facebook developers show a sense of humor.

  * When you sign into your Facebook account you can see which language your account is supporting right at the bottom of the page. You will see English UK or English US in all probability.
  * Click on it and you will get an option to change the language as shown in image below.

So go ahead and have fun, bring about a little bit of pirate on your Facebook account. It has a lot of tongue in cheek humor for Pirate language parleys for otherwise out usual Facebook features.
