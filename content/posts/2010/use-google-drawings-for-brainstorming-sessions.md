[Google Docs has changed its layout][1] and added a lot of functions regarding live editing and also formatting. While trying to look up more options I came across Google Drawings a much unused and unknown feature with Google Docs.

**Google Drawings** is available with **Google Docs** and you can create one just like you create a spreadsheet or presentation. The layout is quite simple and self explanatory. You might want to go to settings and turn on the new Document settings for better options and live collaboration.

Finally start drawing rough sketches of anything you are working on and share it with a list of friends on Gmail.

### **Where Google Drawings can be useful?**

  * This tool is a great way to work together with a group and use images and drawings to brainstorm. Brainstorming sessions need a lot of drawings and [flow charts][2] to explain how things will work or how an idea should progress. For instance a web design company might have designers in different locations and brain storm about the new options it might include in its web site.
  * Here** Google Drawings **work brilliantly as one person can change a drawing almost live and actually exchange ideas in a visual format. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words and while explaining things it surely helps to have charts and images.
  * I am not sure this tool can be used as a professional design tool for complex designs and drawings but it certainly is great for creating rough outlines and drawings.

What do you think about **Google Drawings**? Will you find it useful? Do drop in your comments with your views.
