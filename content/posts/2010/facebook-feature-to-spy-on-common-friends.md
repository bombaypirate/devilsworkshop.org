After letting you <a href="http://fbknol.com/download-all-your-facebook-details-in-a-zip-file/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/download-all-your-facebook-details-in-a-zip-file/', 'save your Facebook information on your computer']);" >save your Facebook information on your computer</a> now Facebook has come up with a new feature that enables you to see everything you share with your friends. Earlier if I wanted to see what my friend A has said to Friend B or what are they sharing recently, I had to indivisually go to their home page/wall and see. Quite tiresome, right?

Well, Facebook has recently come up with a **Friendship page**, where you can see all the updates, messages, links or photographs two friends share. You can view what you and your friend shared or two of your friends shared on Facebook. Â It can be like a personal record of all your recent activities with your friends.

## How to see the Friendship page?

  * Whenever you or somebody writes on your friend&#8217;s wall and it gets displayed, just below the notification you get a link to &#8216;**See Friendship**&#8216;.
  * Once clicked, you are taken to a page where recent activities shared are displayed.
  * Common likes and interests are also displayed below.

On the upper hand side of the page you can &#8216;Browse Friendships&#8217; or you can type the names of your friends you want to see. There are no privacy issues here. When you want to see the conversation of two of your friends and you are taken to the friendship page of your friend then any privacy setting enabled by any one of them remains the same. That is if he/she doesn&#8217;t want you to see the updates then you can&#8217;t.

This can be a problem if you do not want your friends or people to see the conversation between your friends. Anybody can go and see the shared things between your friends and you. You need to be extra careful towards what you post and do on Facebook. In other words, the need to have a <a href="http://fbknol.com/best-privacy-settings-for-your-facebook-profile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/best-privacy-settings-for-your-facebook-profile/', 'good privacy settings']);" >good privacy settings</a> has been increased. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But if you have created a good friend list and tweaked your settings then this feature can let you have fun. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
