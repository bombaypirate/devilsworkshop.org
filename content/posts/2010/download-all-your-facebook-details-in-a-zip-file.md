For security reasons we always want to keep a **copy** of our things. Remember when you made a list of all your favourite songs and saved them in a disc, you never forget to make an extra copy of an important project , then why not **Facebook**? It is now becoming an important part of your lives. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Now you can make a copy of your **Facebook account** by just downloading a **zipped** file to your computer containing everything and anything that you have ever posted on Facebook.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/download-all-your-facebook-details-in-a-zip-file/download_facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/download-all-your-facebook-details-in-a-zip-file/download_facebook/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3025"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3025" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/download_facebook.png" alt="" width="563" height="338" /></a>

## Information that will be included in the zip file:

  * Profile information.
  * List of your friends.
  * View of your Wall.
  * Your videos.
  * Notes that you have made.
  * Events you RSVP-ed to Yes.
  * Inbox messages.

Quite an information to be kept. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This can be helpful if incase your hard disk gets corrupted, you can get at least some photos from Facebook that you have ever uploaded or may be you just want to keep a record on what all you said or wrote on Facebook.

### How to download the file?

  * Go to Account Settings
  * Click download

You will be asked the password and some security questions before downloading, due to security reasons. This download feature will not remove the Facebook profile but will help you in keeping a copy with you. This was one of the **<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130', 'feature rolled out by Facebook']);" >feature rolled out by Facebook</a>** yesterday along with **<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-unveils-new-groups-to-share-collaborate-and-group-chat/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-unveils-new-groups-to-share-collaborate-and-group-chat/', 'Groups']);" >Groups</a>** and **<a href="http://fbknol.com/now-control-what-you-share/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/now-control-what-you-share/', 'Application Dashboard']);" >Application Dashboard</a>**.

Here is a nice video which explains the download process.
