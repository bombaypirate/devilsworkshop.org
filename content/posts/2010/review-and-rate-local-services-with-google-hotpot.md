Do you have an opinion about the recent restaurant that opened and want to voice it publicly? Once again, it is Google to the rescue with <a href="http://www.google.com/hotpot" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/hotpot', 'Google Hotpot']);" target="_blank"><strong>Google Hotpot</strong></a>.

**<a href="http://www.google.com/hotpot" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/hotpot', 'Google Hotpot']);" target="_blank">Google Hotpot</a>** gives you an interface with which you can rate, review and seek  recommendations for local services like &#8211; Restaurants, Cinemas, Hospitals, etc.

## What to expect:

  * You can search local businesses as per the keyword typed in, followed by a specific location. Lets say you are looking at &#8216;Cinemas&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Pune&#8217;.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32128" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/review-and-rate-local-services-with-google-hotpot/google_hotpot_searchresult/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32128" title="Google_hotpot_searchresult" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Google_hotpot_searchresult.png" alt="" width="600" height="333" /></a>

  * The search results that are thrown up would allow you to rate the place.
  * You can also go a step further and write a review about the place. This review is displayed the next time someone looks up the same result.

I am particularly drawn towards the concept behind Hotpot because it attempts to add a &#8220;You&#8221; to the search results as compared to random impersonal search result which we are normally used to.

Its fun being a consumer today considering the amount of choice we get for one simple task. Give Google Hotpot a try to let me know your views through your comments.
