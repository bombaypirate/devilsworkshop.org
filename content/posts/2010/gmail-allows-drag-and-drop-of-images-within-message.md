A few days ago I wrote about and also created a video showing how [Gmail allows us to drag and drop files as attachments][1] from the desktop rather than looking them up manually and attaching them. Gmail Labs had a feature to include images within a email message. Now they have mixed both features and you can drag and drop images while composing your email.

### **Use of inserting images within a message**

  * There was earlier a add a button labs feature which allowed adding an image within your email message but this feature allowed me to simple drag and drop an image from desktop onto the message window.
  * This really makes using **Gmail** on a browser almost as simple and efficient as a desktop email client like lets say [Live Mail][2].
  * While I used this feature it did give me some issues while [Gmail offline][3] was enabled. Also this feature works only with Chrome browser at the moment and will be introduced across all browser soon according to <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/drag-images-into-messages.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/drag-images-into-messages.html', 'Gmail Blog']);" >Gmail Blog</a>.

Do try out this feature if you are using **Chrome** and let me know what do you think about it through your comments.

*Here is a video I created to demonstrate Drag and Drop of images within a Gmail in Chrome.*
