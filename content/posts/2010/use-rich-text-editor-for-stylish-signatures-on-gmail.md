Earlier my email signature was simple

Now my email signature on Gmail is a lot more stylish and relevant complete with links to my Facebook profile and Twitter account.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a rel="attachment wp-att-28077" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/use-rich-text-editor-for-stylish-signatures-on-gmail/gmail_signature_rich_text_editor/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28077" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="gmail_signature_rich_text_editor" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/gmail_signature_rich_text_editor.png" alt="" width="550" height="172" /></a>
</p>

Just go to Settings on your Gmail page and look up signature. Write in what you want for your signature and include any image you want. This image cannot be uploaded so you would have to do that somewhere else and enter the URL where it was stored.

As you can see in the above image we can create good looking email signatures with Gmail.
