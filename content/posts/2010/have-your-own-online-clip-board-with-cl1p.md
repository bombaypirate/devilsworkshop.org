I very often have to end up chatting with Facebook contacts or even [Twitter contacts][1] whom I might not want to share my email address with. Sometimes when I feel like brainstorming with them it is a little difficult to get to share information without sharing your email address. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Personally at work I like to collaborate with colleagues and friends by using [Google Docs especially after its new features][2] but sometimes I wish it collaboration could be done without sharing email address.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-26961" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/have-your-own-online-clip-board-with-cl1p/clipboard_internet_cl1p/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26961" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="clipboard_internet_cl1p" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/clipboard_internet_cl1p.png" alt="" width="550" height="344" /></a>

### **About <a href="http://cl1p.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cl1p.net', 'Cl1p']);" >Cl1p</a>**

  * There is no need to sign-in or register. Just add anything ahead of &#8220;http://cl1p.net&#8221; like my example from above image &#8220;http://cl1p.net**/dw-demo**&#8220;.
  * Once done you can start writing in whatever you want or even copy- pasting links or text you are working with. Once done click on **&#8216;Save&#8217;** and that URL can be shared with anyone.
  * The person who shares this URL can also edit the clipboard which is perfect for a writing in messages and exchanging them in a collaborative way.

I feel this is best used sometimes while taking random notes and storing them online especially when I need to save them temporarily. It is perfect as the link expires after 8 days and hence I do not have to bother with deleting or tracking such clipboard messages.

Try it out at **<a href="http://cl1p.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cl1p.net', 'Cl1p.net']);" >Cl1p.net</a>** and do let me know your view on it by dropping in your comments.
