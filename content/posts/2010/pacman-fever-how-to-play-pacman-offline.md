With google introducing Pacman Doodle on its homepage, the game has once again gained popularity among people. Even some of our readers are Pacman fans, and want to play the game offline. In reply to our post- <a title="Google Doodle Presents Pacman" rel="bookmark" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-doodle-presents-pacman/" target="_blank">Google Doodle Presents Pacman</a>, one of our readers had a question on <a title="Pacman offline" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-doodle-presents-pacman/#comment-155481" target="_blank">making the game available offline</a>. This post is a reply to him and various other readers and Pacman fans, who want to play the game offline.

A group of users have uploaded the source for the game on github. You can download the source code by heading over to the link: <a href="http://github.com/macek/google_pacman" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://github.com/macek/google_pacman', 'http://github.com/macek/google_pacman']);" title="Google Doodle Pacman source code"  target="_blank">http://github.com/macek/google_pacman</a>

  * Clicking on **Download Source** on top-right corner will download the source for you. Extract the source files from the zipped file, anywhere on your system.
  * Double click on **index.html** file to run the game offline in your default browser.

Here&#8217;s an offline preview of the game:

You can also play the game live via github using this link: <a href="http://macek.github.com/google_pacman/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://macek.github.com/google_pacman/', 'http://macek.github.com/google_pacman/']);" >http://macek.github.com/google_pacman/</a>

The source is also available on mediafire. Head over to the <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?kml3oz0mwyy" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mediafire.com/?kml3oz0mwyy', 'direct download link']);" title="direct download link"  target="_blank">direct download link</a>. (*Graphics of this source are different from Google&#8217;s Pacman doodle*)

Linux users can download the source code for **NJAM**: a Pacman-like game for linux from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/njam/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sourceforge.net/projects/njam/', 'http://sourceforge.net/projects/njam/']);" title="Pacman for linux"  target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/njam/</a>

Google in the announcement to place a playable version of Pacman as a doodle, made it clear that the playable game will stay as doodle on their homepage for 48 hours. But, this unique idea received such an overwhelming response that google has made it permanently available at <a href="http://www.google.com/pacman" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/pacman', 'www.google.com/pacman']);" title="Pacman"  target="_blank">www.google.com/pacman</a>.
