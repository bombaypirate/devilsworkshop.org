After more than 4 years, I guess, Google has finally revamped blogger&#8217;s favorite advertising network **Google AdSense**.

I just logged into Google AdSense to see new interface waiting for me. Below is screenshot of our new Google AdSense dashboard&#8230;

I will update this post once I am done with exploring new AdSense user-interface. Updates are added below now.

**New &#8220;My Ads&#8221; Section**

New ad-units management simply rocks. Its neat, clean, easy to navigate and extremely well-organized. *(See screenshot below)*

### Performance Reports with Graphs!

I hardly get time to check our Google AdSense account, but as far as I remember old AdSense didn&#8217;t have any charts or graphs in performance reports section.

New AdSense interface adds graphs to performance reports on similar lines like Google Analytics! Means you can select timeline and configure reporting parameters with simple clicks!

### Overall&#8230;

In any interface redesign project, generally we need some time to get used to with it. Here I see absolutely zero learning curve. It&#8217;s so intuitive that in less than 10 minutes I got comfortable with everything.

Also thank you Google for giving me early access to new adsense interface. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
