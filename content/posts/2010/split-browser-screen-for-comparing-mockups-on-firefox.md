title: 'Split Browser Screen for Comparing Mockups [Firefox Extension-Tile Tab]'
author: huzaifadarbar

excerpt: I always find it difficult to compare mockups with my website, so I came across a Mozilla Addon which splits the browser in tile pattern. I used to compare the mockup with the original website is to toggle ALT + TAB. Then I found a better solution which can be used with Mozilla Addon called Tile Tabs. There are several ways of doing this but I found Tile Tabs the easiest to use.

I always find it difficult to compare mockups with my website, so I came across a Mozilla add-on which splits the browser in tile pattern. I used to compare the mockup with the original website is to toggle ALT + TAB. Then I found a better solution which can be used with Mozilla add-on called Tile Tabs. There are several ways of doing this but I found Tile Tabs the easiest to use.

## How to go about it :

  * Install fire fox add-on “<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/71411/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/71411/', 'Tile Tabs']);" >Tile Tabs</a>”.
  * Open your .JPG (whatever the extension is .gif .png) file in browser window.
  * Right Click your mouse button to open the image with Firefox.

  * Now switch to your browser.
  * Go to file menu->Tile.
  * Tile Tab->Below->choose your tab (in which the image file is opened).

  * Press F9 (Shortcut key) to toggle screen and F8 to toggle synchronize scroll.
  * Now you can see in the below image how it works.
