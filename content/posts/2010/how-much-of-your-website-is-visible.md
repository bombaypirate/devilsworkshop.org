If you are a web designer you might want to know how much of your site is visible to visitors. Google has come up with a model to let you analyze how much of the browser window is open to be viewed by users. This is crucial as sometimes you might have a significant number of visitors not paying attention to certain parts of your website. It could be a donate button or even a link to subscribe to your blog.

### Google Browser Size

  * Just visit the <a href="http://browsersize.googlelabs.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://browsersize.googlelabs.com', 'Google Browser Size']);" >Google Browser Size</a> page. Here you need to enter the URL you want to check for browser size.
  * Immediately the browser size is represented in a graph along with website as the background. Check image below for a representation. The opacity can be increased or decreased.
  * This showed that over 50% of the internet users view all of DW website while some might not be viewing the subscribe button.
  * Just a word of caution before you feel disheartened, as these stats are taken from visits to Google.com and hence might not reflect all that correctly for other websites.Â  For example someone visiting a tech blog might actually explore it details as to not miss out on much.

I still think that it would be prudent for web designers to look up their websites through this Google tool and maybe start working on some minor adjustments if needed. Do check it out and drop in your comments with your views and opinions. ðŸ˜‰
