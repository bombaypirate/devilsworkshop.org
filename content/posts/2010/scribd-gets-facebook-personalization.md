  On the right hand side of the Scribd page you can see your friends activities that is what are they reading or what they wish to read. And when you find something that you enjoy, with a simple click of the Like button, you can quickly and easily share it with your friends. There will not be any privacy issue as it will use only the public information you share with your friends on Facebook to personalize your reading experience. You can learn more about the instant personalization program <a href="http://www.facebook.com/instant_personalization" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/instant_personalization', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>.

Main idea behind all the personalization is sharing what you love with the people you love that is your friends. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> People share more than 55,000 items on Scribd every day, exchanging all sort of documents and details. After all Sharing is loving and Facebook wants people to share and love. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Facebook sure loves to see people share things and enjoy! What do you think of such personalizations? Do share it with me through your comments.
