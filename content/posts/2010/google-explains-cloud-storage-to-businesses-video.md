Google has recently become aggressive. Only recently at their [Google IO developers][1] conference it mocked Apple&#8217;s obsession with control over its products. Now **Google Apps** is pitching itself aggressively to companies large and small and trying to convince them to switch over to **Google Apps** to handle their business needs.

Google has also launched a <a href="http://www.gonegoogle.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gonegoogle.com', 'online calculator']);" >online calculator</a> which is a fancy way of showing a presentation to you explaining why you need to move over to Google Apps which uses [cloud computing][2].

  * Google Apps is used by many companies large and small along with many educational institutions.
  * A key advantage is the familiar Gmail interface and many of its features like Google Docs and Calendar. Also since the data is saved online security updates do not need to be downloaded and installed thus saving valuable time.

We at rtBlogs use Google Apps and you might be like to read up on [how to configure Google Apps for your domain.][3]

Below is a video of Google explaining companies should use Google Apps.



So what are your experiances with **Google Apps**? Are you still apprehensive that all your emails and documents are stored with Google? Do let me know through your comments.
