We saw how Google Pacman took the world by storm a few days ago. I think everyone reading this post probably spent some time playing [Pacman on Google&#8217;s Pacman Doodle][1] which probably has not gone down to become legendary. Even I spent a bit of time and it quite refreshingly brought back nostalgia of 386 Processor computers with their limited storage and processing ability. ðŸ˜€

But what did this unexpected time off with **Pacman** cost the economy?

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25340" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/convert-google-doodle-pacman-into-multi-player-game/pacmanmultiplayer-png/"><img class="aligncenter size-full  wp-image-50943" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/pacmanmultiplayer.png" alt="" width="576" height="201" /></a>

Here are some mind boggling numbers of the cost that economies endured because of a simple Doodle from Google.

  * Over all Google had **504,703,000 unique visitors** when the **Pacman Doodle **went up.
  * This over all amounted to **4.8 million** work hours being lost to Google as people ended up on an average spending **36 seconds** instead of the usual **4 seconds** on Google search.
  * So the total cost to our economies is about **$120 Million** and with that money we could have hired the entire Google workforce of **19,835** for about six weeks.

The response to Google&#8217;s Pacman has been so phenomenal that they have decided to create a page where it is available at any time. So now you can play Pacman at <a href="http://www.google.com/pacman/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/pacman/', 'Google.com/pacman']);" ><strong>Google.com/pacman</strong></a>

So tell us what you think about Google Pacman&#8217;s effect? Was it really a waste of money or was it actually a great way to unwind and put up a smile on your face before your day began? Do let me know through your comments.
