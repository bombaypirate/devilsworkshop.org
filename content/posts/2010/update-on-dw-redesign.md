Many of our regular readers are aware that we are working on a new theme for Devil&#8217;s Workshop. Yes we are coming closer to completing this project. We have included a lot of new suggestions from our readers who commented and emailed us with their suggestions.

We have tried to include everything that was asked for without trying to change ourselves too much. The endeavor was to make a better Devil&#8217;s Workshop and not a different one.

We have tried to keep to retain the familiarity of Devil&#8217;s Workshop&#8217;s current theme and tried to improve on it with our new theme. We have opted to have a magazine style theme which a lot of readers did want. Personally I think Magazine styled theme does help a great deal to navigate a website a lot more easily.

### Homepage features

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19196" title="DW_redesign_update2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/01/DW_redesign_update2.png" alt="DW_redesign_update2" width="500" height="332" />

The new homepage layout will show lesser than 10 posts that we show with our present theme. This is to highlight with excerpts only the latest posts on the homepage. This was a decision which was debated but we feel that showing posts under categories would be better than showing 10 posts on the homepage. This will help make it easier to navigate our website.

A new addition on our homepage will be categories gaining a lot of prominence. We have got some feedback that using categories for navigating our website has been an issue. This will change as all the categories with some of the recent posts under those categories will be displayed on the homepage itself. The design is still being worked on and you can expect the navbar to have some more additions.

I hope you liked the screenshots of some of the several new changes we will have with Devil&#8217;s Workshop&#8217;s new theme. Hope you like what you see at the moment.

### Note to Authors

If you are a guest author or privileged author with **DW**, you might want to look up and make some changes with your profile information. As you might have noticed we have stopped the **Editor&#8217;s Note** section for our guest authors as now there is a automated method of doing the same. See image below to check how the new information will be displayed.

As you can see the number of posts show up along with the website address. If you include your twitter account id, a link is generated for readers to get to your Twitter page.

**Note that these changes are already in effect **and all you have to do is

  * Log into** DW** and get to the **Dashboa**rd.
  * Once at the **Dashboard** click on **Your Profile** on the right hand side.
  * Carefully fill in all the details you want to show up with your guest post.
  * Ideally keep the biography short only up-to a line as you can see there is a space constraint for displaying the biography with the post.

Hope you all enjoy the new theme and do keep your suggestions and opinion on what you want through your comments.
