[<img class="wp-image-50173" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/indiapostlogo_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="india-post-logo" width="244" height="125" align="left" />][1] One of the biggest problems students and working professionals with transferable jobs face is to get an address proof. Without a proper address proof, one canâ€™t get basic things like mobile connection, internet connection, gas connection nor can apply for passport or open up a bank account.

Keeping this in mind, Indian Postal Department is issuing photo id card with address proof through their large network of post offices. The process is very simple and straight forward.

### **Procedure to get Address proof  
**

  1. Obtain the form for address proof from your nearest post office by paying Rs. 10/-.
  2. After filling up the form submit it in the post office along with a fee of Rs. 240/-.
  3. A postman is sent by the Postal Department to verify the address you provided.
  4. After the verification is done youâ€™ll get the address id card.
  5. The entire process can take up to 2 months, though it also depends on the efficiency of your post office. ðŸ˜‰

You can also download the form from [here][2]. (In this case youâ€™ll have to add the cost of form with the application fee, thus final amount to be paid is still Rs. 250/-).

### Fees

Apart from the cost of application form which is Rs. 10/-, you also need to submit a fee of:

  1. Rs. 240/- for a new card.
  2. Rs. 140/- for renewal.
  3. Rs. 90/- for duplicate.

### Salient Features

  1. The card serves both as identity proof and address proof.
  2. The card is valid for a period of 3 years, after which it has to be renewed.
  3. Not all post offices issue the card. So you need to find the nearest post office that provides this facility.

You can read more about this service in the <a href="http://www.indiapost.gov.in/PO_Guide_Part-1.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.indiapost.gov.in/PO_Guide_Part-1.pdf', 'official Post Office Guide']);" >official Post Office Guide</a> â€“Section 63 (page no. 65).

Considering the wide range of Indian Postal Department, this step is going to help a lot of people, even those who live in remote areas. Looks like postal department is trying to revamp its image by introducing such public oriented schemes. :-D.

However apart from introducing such services, postal department should also ensure that the information is easily available to general public. Even though this service has been in operation for quite some time now, not many are aware of it. When I checked the official website of Indian Postal Department, I did not find this information online. Nor did contacting them on twitter helped (Iâ€™m still awaiting a reply after more than 10 days :-P).
