Winrar needs no introduction, it is most common software which helps to store data in compressed format and make data easy to share. Inspite of having good features in Winrar , many of us don’t prefer to use Winrar. If you are one of them who don’t prefer to use Winrar then there are many alternatives available which have same or better features than Winrar.

Unlike Winrar, these softwares are free and user-friendly. Here are the 5 best alternatives to Winrar:

### **#1. IZArc**

<a href="http://www.izarc.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.izarc.org/', 'IzArc']);" >IzArc</a> is user-friendly and supports almost all the archives formats. It allows dragging and dropping files from windows explorer. The best part I like about IZArc is that it allows to open CD image like ISO, Bin and NRG and you can also convert them from one type to another.

Like IZArc, it also compresses CD and DVD files and gives option to preview pictures in compressed archives.
