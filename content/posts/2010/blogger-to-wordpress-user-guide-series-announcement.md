Early this month we announced an [affiliate program with our Blogger to WordPress Migration service][1]. This service has migrated many blogs onto the WordPress platform.

We got a lot of queries from clients (who had migrated newly to WordPress) about features which are integral to WordPress platform. We had initially planned a simple FAQ with some common issues which are faced by bloggers new to WordPress.

The idea further developed into creating a <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/the-blogger-to-wordpress-user-guide-series/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/the-blogger-to-wordpress-user-guide-series/', 'Blogger to WordPress user-guide']);" >Blogger to WordPress user-guide</a> on our <a href="http://bloggertowp.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org', 'Blogger to WP website']);" >Blogger to WP website</a>.
