<a href="http://www.tineye.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tineye.com/', 'TinEye']);" title="TinEye"  target="_blank">TinEye</a> uses image identification technology , rather than metadata or keywords, to identify similar images on the web. Normally, we use keywords to search for the images in image search engines. The images that match with the keywords are displayed as results, and that&#8217;s all we are allowed to do. TinEye identifies the altered copies of the image on the web that might have been cropped, edited, or resized.

TinEye is the first search engine of its kind, that uses image identification technology. Currently it is in Beta stage, and allows 100 searches per day for free users. The reverse image search engine will revolutionize web technology, changing the way we search. Recently I introduced **<a title="WhatTheFont" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-find-mystery-fonts-with-images/" target="_blank">WhatTheFont</a>** &#8211; A website that allows you to <a title="How to find mystery fonts with images?" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-find-mystery-fonts-with-images/" target="_blank">find mystery font in images</a>.

Here also, simply upload the image on the website, and it comes up with the results. Some of the uses of **TinEye **search engine are &#8211;

  * Find out where an image came from, or get more information about it.
  * Discover modified or edited version of the image.
  * Discover the webpages that made use of the image.
  * Compare similarities and dissimilarities between two images.

To give you a better view of the search engine, i performed a search by uploading the image i captured after i was tired of getting application errors on google chrome.

At once, the search engine came up with 27 results of images similar to the uploaded image. And, i got the answer for my problem! Here is another screenshot of results:
