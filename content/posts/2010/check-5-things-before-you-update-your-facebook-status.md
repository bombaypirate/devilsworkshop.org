People these days are so much involved with **social media** that sometimes they just put themselves in danger. Here are some of the points one should always keep in mind while updating the status on **Facebook**.

  * **Holiday**: If you are going for a holiday and leaving home, it is not advisable to update the status message like that. You never know who is keeping an eye on you. Such <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-facebook-can-lead-to-robbery/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-facebook-can-lead-to-robbery/', 'updates can lead to robbery also']);" >updates can lead to robbery also</a>.
  * **Birthday year**: Generally these dates are used as a password by many people, either change the way you create a password or just stop giving this information publicly.
  * **Home address and phone numbers**: I know you do want to stay in touch with friends and all but please do you want it to be used incorrectly at all?
  * **Personal Status updates**: Personal status updates are a strict no no. I know how much you want to tell whats going on in your life but ever imagined the day you had a terrible day in office and updated something really harsh about your boss and he reads the update? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I can&#8217;t even imagine that. Well you can choose to update it all but<a href="http://fbknol.com/best-privacy-settings-for-your-facebook-profile/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/best-privacy-settings-for-your-facebook-profile/', ' do not forget to tweak your privacy settings']);" > do not forget to tweak your privacy settings</a>.
  * **Rude  jokes or comments**: You may have a weird sense of humor but you cannot expect everyone to have it.  Things like this can lead to fights or misunderstandings that may take time to recover.

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">Use Facebook as a place to interact with friends or new people in your network or find a job or to know about people, not to put your self or others in danger by status updates.  Do not scare people with a lot of updates and all. Well, everything has a good and bad side of it. What do you think? Drop in your views through the comments below.<br /> </span>
