  If you like social networks, Gmail or just about any site, chances are there is a helpful GreaseMonkey script on it. It would be really nice if while on a website I had a simpler way of looking up a GreaseMonkey script than actually searching for it.
  
  This is where Greasefire Addon is very helpful.
