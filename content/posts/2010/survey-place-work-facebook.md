I always used to think what Facebook office would be from inside? Do people love working there or its all from outside only. Well, recently Glassdoor.com announced that <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.glassdoor.com/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm', 'Facebook is at the top of its third-annual list of 50 best places to work']);" >Facebook is at the top of its third-annual list of 50 best places to work</a>, beating out last year’s No.1, Southwest Airlines. Apple is at 20, Google -30, Adobe-39, Salesforce.com-41 and Intel-45.

People working at Facebook have given <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Facebook-Reviews-E40772.htm?listFilter=BPTW2011" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Facebook-Reviews-E40772.htm?listFilter=BPTW2011', 'awesome reviews']);" >awesome reviews</a> about the company. They love working there because of the great opportunities, great place to work, employees are satisfied with the job and salary.

They gave rating of 4.6 out of 5 to Mark Zuckerberg. Well I guess this is one news that should not be missed if you love Facebook. I hope it continues to grow and keep making changes to make it more and more lovable.
