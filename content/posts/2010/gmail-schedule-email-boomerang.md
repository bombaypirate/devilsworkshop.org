title: '[Gmail] Schedule an email to be sent later with Boomerang'

excerpt: |
  At work my email is managed thanks to Google Apps and my personal email account is on Gmail. Gmail has many fantastic features but lacks an email scheduler. Most times we do not need an email to be sent out at a later date but there are special occasions when I wish we could just schedule some emails out to people.
  
  This happens many times during birthday’s and also occasions like Diwali, Christmas and New Year.

  * **Boomerang **works as a add-on or extension with Firefox and Chrome browsers. It just adds an extra button which allowed me to schedule email at later times.
  * As you can see in the image below, there are many options along with sending the email after a specified amount of time or even set specific time in the calendar. It can also be set to be sent out at a random time.

I guess this year I can schedule &#8220;Happy New Year&#8221; messages to all my friends well in advance thanks to Boomerang!
