If I ask you what is the trending topic on Facebook and twitter, without a pause you will tell me. It is how <a href="http://fbknol.com/cartoon-characters-as-profile-pictures-go-viral-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/cartoon-characters-as-profile-pictures-go-viral-on-facebook/', 'Cartoon characters as profile pictures are going viral on Facebook']);" >Cartoon characters as profile pictures are going viral on Facebook</a> ! It is being done to raise a voice against child abuse and to remember those lovely days when we were a kid and loved our cartoons. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This is gaining a lot of popularity on Twitter. There are people who are for and against the topic.

Some examples:

> &#8221; RT if you have changed your default picture into a cartoon character on Facebook as a support against child abuse. &#8220;

> &#8220;I care so much about fighting child abuse that I&#8217;m going to go the extra mile and make several new Facebook accounts with cartoon defaults.&#8221;

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JWSeveredTWWK/status/10992344690069504" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/JWSeveredTWWK/status/10992344690069504', '']);" ></a> These are some of the people who are ready to do anything and everything to raise an awareness. From retweeting about it to making new accounts, or to share this information as much as possible, every concerned person is doing what he can.

But at the same time there are people who are getting irritated with the profile updates and cartoon images suddenly making Facebook Network go Cartoon Network !

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AndreaCYeung/status/10996175272411136" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/AndreaCYeung/status/10996175272411136', '@AndreaCYeung']);" >@AndreaCYeung</a> says that

> &#8220;#somewheretonight there&#8217;s a beaten child wondering how a cartoon display picture on Facebook will stop his scars.&#8221;

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AndreaCYeung/status/10996175272411136" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/AndreaCYeung/status/10996175272411136', '']);" ></a> Even I wrote about the cartoon characters replacing original image on Facebook, but I did this to remember my lovely childhood days. Yes, these things will increase some awareness towards people but that&#8217;s it. Will it do something really against those people who continue to abuse children? Will they stop and think about it just by seeing Facebook profiles ? I guess it needs more of self-awareness and a much bigger campaign than a Facebook event. If at least one adult thinks about it and realizes what he is doing wrong, then this is a great success!
