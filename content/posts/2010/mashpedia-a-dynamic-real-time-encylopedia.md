Most times when we look up some specific information about a very large company or place, the best place seems to be Wikipedia. But Wikipedia is updated quite frequently but the content in **Wikipedia **is very definition oriented. That means we get a very basic idea of something we are researching. I came across this website called Mashpedia which is really useful to carry out some research as it collects and collates information very dynamically in real time.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-24038" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/mashpedia-a-dynamic-real-time-encylopedia/mashpedia_encylopedia/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24038" title="mashpedia_encylopedia" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/mashpedia_encylopedia.png" alt="" width="383" height="205" /></a>

  * Once you search for a subject on **Mashpedia** it gives you a great deal of information. The first thing you will notice is the Wikipedia article on it. It will be a abridged or summarized version of the article on Wikipedia.
  * But the real dirt comes from a host of other real-time links like latest **trending tweets**, links to [You Tube videos][1], relative image links and also Flickr links.
  * It also shares with you relevant latest articles about the subject you are researching from Digg and other Blog websites.
  * Links to latest news about the same subject also ensures a great deal of information on something you are looking up without really needing to go through endless search results on Google or deal with the bland info given in Wikipedia.

Do try out <a href="http://www.mashpedia.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mashpedia.com', 'Mashpedia']);" ><strong>Mashpedia</strong></a> and let me know what your views are. I think it takes the [idea of Wikis][2] a little further and makes it more real-time which is a boon for looking up current information on just about anything.
