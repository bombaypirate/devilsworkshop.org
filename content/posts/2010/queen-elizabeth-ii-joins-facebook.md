This new Facebooker is no stranger to &#8216;networking&#8217; socially. Glancing through the heaps of comments, greetings, and pictures of the royalty, I noticed the regularity with which discussions are held, varied topics are debated as well as statuses are updated. It is impressive to say the least.

What is interesting to talk about though is how Facebook brings out the irony of life. When the paparazzi goes crazy outside the palatial houses, mobs of regular people huddle around bullet proof cars &#8211; we tend to believe that we, &#8216;regular people&#8217; are the ones hungry to shower our attention on popular people. But when the Queen herself makes an official entry to Twitter and now Facebook, one thinks it&#8217;s not all one-sided.

Let me know what you think about the newbie on Facebook. Drop in your comments below.
