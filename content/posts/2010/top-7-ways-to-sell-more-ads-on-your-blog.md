#### 1. Use ‘Your Ads Here’ banners and links

This is the most basic step towards selling ads on your blog website. Most people put it up and pull it off after a few days when they get discouraged with no sale. Keep at it. Patience is required in everything. It is important that you show the ‘Advertise Here’ or ‘Your Ads here’ banners on your blog because the advertiser wants to know exactly where their ad will go. And you should create an ‘Advertise Here’ page on your blog where you show all advertising options on your blog with other details about your blog.

#### 2. Start with a Competitive Price

In the beginning always quote the lowest price which you can accept. Then eventually you can go higher. Each advertiser will review the performance of their ads on your blog for the first few months. So you can initially lure them with a low price or even better offer a special price for the first month. If you keep a high price in the beginning itself, then very few advertisers will try out your ad spots.

#### 3. Twitter Tweets

Twitter is an awesome tool when you have to let people know that you are ready for advertisers on your blog, provided you have a lot of followers &#8211; you are sure to get a few enquiries, I always have. Send out a tweet like &#8211; &#8220;Blog XYZ is now looking for Sponsors! Reply if interested.&#8221;

#### 4. Keep Your Ads in a Very Prominent Position

If you were an advertiser then where would you like to keep your ads, obviously at the top! So you should always give your advertisers ad spots that they would really like. Don&#8217;t place ad boxes in dark corners of your blog where no one can see them and prospective advertisers would be put off.

#### 5. Do a Post Informing You are Advertising

This point is skipped or forgotten by many bloggers, while many do not know the real benefit of posting an article about the advertising plan which you offer. Most of your readers will also be having websites in your niche, so it is important that you inform that you are offering ad spots. Don&#8217;t be shy about letting everyone know about your ad boxes.

#### 6. Don&#8217;t Put too many ad boxes

Don&#8217;t end up putting too many banner ads on your blog website. Show only fewer banner ads, adding too many ads will damage your image among your blog readers and will also have bad impact on your blog design. Having too many ads will make your blog look like a collection of ads only where your real work will not be much highlighted.

#### 7. Review Your Sponsors Monthly

You can review your advertisers on a monthly basis, so that they get the lime light and get the total readers focus. Also, it will help you in showing the value added benefits you provide on advertising on your blog. You can send additional traffic to your advertiser’s website through such promotional posts on your blog.
