I have always found services which help me use Twitter through messenger quite fascinating. As a blogger I have tried many Twitter based desktop applications. But the one I most use to check tweets after a few hours is through MSN. You might have read up on [how to use MSN messenger for looking up tweets][1] before on DW.

Tweet Switch is a useful tool which not only allows me to monitor my Twitter account with MSN, but also supports **Gtalk, Yahoo Messenger, AIM and ICQ.**

Okay why I liked Tweet Switch is because it gives me the option of receiving Tweets on various Messengers with options on switching the selected messengers based on which one I am signed into.

For example I log in with **Gtalk, **but I log out then the tweets are then sent to another messenger I have specified for example **Live Messenger**. If I am not signed into **Live Messenger**, I can have a 3rd Messenger configured to retrieve and send tweets.

### How does it do it?

  * Major plus point of **Tweet Switch** is that I did not need to sign up or register. Only needed to enter my Twitter account details. After that I just needed to enter my chat id for various messengers.
  * AÂ  bot called *&#8216;tweetswitch*&#8216; will be added to your friends list. Just start using the commands for retrieving and sending your tweets through the chat window.

Let me know if you find the idea of looking up and sending Tweets through your chat messenger useful or do you think it does not make much of difference and you would still stick to your handy desktop twitter based application?
