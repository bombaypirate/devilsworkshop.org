As the year 2010 approaches to the end, there are applications being made specially for this. One such application caught my eye. My year in status is one such application that is gaining popularity very fast.Â <span style="font-size: 11.6667px">This application lets you see a collage of all your status updates of the year.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11.6667px"> </span><figure id="attachment_4444" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<a href="http://fbknol.com/year-status-facebookapplication/my-year-in-status-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/year-status-facebookapplication/my-year-in-status-on-facebook/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-4444"><img class="size-full   wp-image-53645" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/My-year-in-status-on-Facebook.png" alt="My year in status on Facebook" width="500" height="500" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My year in status on Facebook</figcaption></figure> 

<span style="font-size: 11.6667px">How to make a Status Update collage ?</span>

  * Go <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=190405249638" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=190405249638', 'here']);" >here</a>.
  * Click on Start.
  * Click on Allow.
  * It will take some time, and the collage will be created.
  * You can choose from a set of styles and a set of captions.
  * Once chosen everything, Click on Publish to my Wall.

I find this application interesting as it made me smile and think of all those moments when I had fun or was not in a great mood. Anyways, do try it once and see if this reminds you of something. Feel free to share your views through the comments below.
