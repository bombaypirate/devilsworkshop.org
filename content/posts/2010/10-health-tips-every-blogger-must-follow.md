Those long hours of surfing, yup. Of course this is not healthy in any way. Here are 10 tips that I follow regularly and what-do-ya-know, feeling quite great now, read on.<!--more-->So getting straight to our points:

  1. Take a break every 60-90 minutes and look away from your computer screen.
  2. If your adamant on staying on your computer for longer durations of time, decrease your monitor&#8217;s brightness.
  3. Eat Healthy &#8211; Avoid junk food the most you can.
  4. Take the stairs to your home or office, instead of the elevator (5 floors by stairs and the rest via elevator would be a good start)
  5. Quite possibly, the area of the body most affected would be the neck. Perform simple neck exercises (for eg. head roll exercise &#8211; google it!)
  6. If you&#8217;re a hardcore blogger, you&#8217;d most possible have a seething backache. You could do <a href="http://www.abs-exercise-advice.com/exercises-for-lower-back-pain.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.abs-exercise-advice.com/exercises-for-lower-back-pain.html', 'some exercise']);" target="_blank">some exercise</a> for this as well.
  7. Use a chair that is comfortable and that has the right height. And so also for other accessories like your keyboard and mouse. *(image credit: <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23283" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23283', 'medicinenet.com']);" target="_blank">medicinenet.com</a>)*

      * If possible, join a gym and exercise there regularly.
      * Avoid any sort of addictions to alcohol/smoking. A stationary lifestyle coupled with such addictions is a perfect recipe for disaster.
      * Listen to soothing music or play flash games. Better yet meet up with your friends and interact with them (offline, not on Facebook!) Take your mind off and release the stress!</ol> 
    
    If not all of them, at least try to follow some of the tips given above. I&#8217;ve got just one statement to say, &#8216;Health Is Wealth.&#8217;
