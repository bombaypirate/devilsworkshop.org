If you are a developer or a WordPress geek, the you might be interested in downloading WordPress 3.1 beta 1 version. This version is expected to have bugs and is being made available only for testing purposes. Hence, do not upgrade to 3.1 beta 1 on a live site. Try it out on a test server.

## WordPress 3.1 Beta 1

  * Some of the changes to watch out with WordPress 3.1 Beta 1 will be to Post Formats, Theme Search, Admin Bar and much more. See complete list <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/11/wordpress-3-1-beta-1/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/news/2010/11/wordpress-3-1-beta-1/', 'here']);" >here</a>.
  * As I mentioned in this post earlier, this is meant only for testing and not to be used with a live website. Once bugs are found and fixed the version will update overnight.
  * If you have found a bug or any issue with the new feature you can bring it up at their <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta', 'alpha/beta forum']);" >alpha/beta forum</a>.
  * WordPress 3.1 Beta 1 does not work with BuddyPress as yet. It should be fixed in time.

The final version of WordPress 3.1 should be out in a couple of months. It is slated to release by the end of this year or early next year.
