Facebook recently announced a new feature on <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=411795942130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=411795942130', 'its blog']);" >its blog</a>. This feature is called Facebook Questions. The way it will operate is quite easy. You go on your Facebook account and ask a question to Facebook users. Your question will be answered by other Facebook users.

Below is an image of how Facebook will introduce this feature on our Facebook accounts.

### What will <a href="http://facebook.com/questions" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://facebook.com/questions', 'Facebook Questions']);" >Facebook Questions</a> mean to Facebook?

  * It will mean simply that your questions can have a potential of 500 million people answering. This huge number means obviously there are a lot of people who are experts in various fields and can answer all kinds of questions you ask.
  * This will create a great platform for users across the world and expertise to interact in a more dynamic way. It might be interesting to see how Yahoo Answers and Google&#8217;s Aardvark will deal with the phenomenon as they also give similar services.
  * This also could open a way for sponsored answers to questions or even consulting charges for very difficult questions which might need considerable research.
  * If Facebook gets this right it will surely be a huge revenue earner for them.

### Can you get Facebook Questions?

No, at the moment the feature is still in beta mode and I tried to access it but message I got was &#8220;we are still not ready for you&#8221; ðŸ˜›
