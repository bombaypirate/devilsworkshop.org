Hiding a folder is a simple way of keeping prying eyes away from your private documents. From a human point of view it&#8217;s a good solution; what you can&#8217;t see, you don&#8217;t know you want. Encrypting a folder can have the opposite effect. The folder is visible and if access is attempted, the need to enter a password positively shouts the message that someone is trying to hide something. This probably explains why there are so many commercial utilities that claim they can securely hide folders.

Hiding a file is pretty simple in Linux ! Its just one step away <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
