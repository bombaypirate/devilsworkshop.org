When ever we Install WordPress, we have a list of some most essential plugins which every WordPress blog should have. In this post I&#8217;m going to talk about one WordPress plugin name Akismet which I believe is one of the most essential plugin and every blog should have from day one.

### What is Akismet WordPress plugin?

Akismet WordPress plugin catches spam comments and trackbacks on your blog. Â It uses Akismet Web services to find comments and trackbacks spam.

If you just started with wordpress, this is the first plugin which you should install to fight against comment spam in WordPress.

Here is a screenshot of Akismet plugin and see what it did for me in last 1 and half year.<figure id="attachment_446" style="width: 520px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
