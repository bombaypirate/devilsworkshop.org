In the days of **Twitter** and **Facebook** taking over our lives one thing that we still use as much if not more than say 5 years ago is Email. A lot of people are using their email a lot more even though email was supposed to die in the past few years thanks to the rise of social networks.

This makes sharing your email address a little risky as it can often mean you will receive untold amounts of spam from various internet marketeers selling you all kinds of unwanted products. <a href="http://www.scr.im" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.scr.im', 'Scr.im']);" ><strong>Scr.im</strong></a> allows creating our email address into short URLs so it can be shared without the spam bots picking it up.

### **About <a href="http://www.scr.im" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.scr.im', 'Scr.im']);" >Scr.im</a>**

  * Type in your email and create a short url automatically. I could also create customized short URLs for protecting my email id.
  * You can share this URL on Twitter, Facebook or even in a HTML document.
  * Once someone clicks on the short URL, he/she will be taken to the website where your email address can be revealed.

This is a pretty decent way to keep your email address safe. I have earlier used and written [about self destructing emails][1] but that is good only if you want to not let even the recipient your email id. With **<a href="http://www.scr.im" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.scr.im', 'scr.im']);" >scr.im</a>** I can share my email address without worrying about some bot picking it up and spamming my **Inbox** to glory.

If you know any more tips or similar services do share by dropping in your comments.
