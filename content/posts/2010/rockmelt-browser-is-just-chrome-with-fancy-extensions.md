Previously I had written about [RockMelt browser which was supposed to make our social networking][1] experience a lot easier. More than social, it was atleast positioning itself as a browser than makes sharing things online very easy. I think **RockMelt **held out a lot of promise as a concept but it disappoints and seems to be just fancier version of Chrome.

Chrome is my favorite browser, so much so that I think it will win the browser wars against IE and Firefox. **RockMelt **is built on Chromium. It is so similar to Chrome that one does not even need to look at the literature to figure that out.

## Some major things missing with RockMelt

  * The first thing I needed to do to even download RockMelt was to use a Facebook account. I think this is a great way for RockMelt to build publicity and become viral as a product but I do not think it is correct for a browser to expect someone to get Facebook account just to download it.
  * You are asked to insert your Facebook credentials to log into this browser. This means now RockMelt can use our profile information on Facebook. This can make some people a little skeptical when it comes to privacy.
  * The browser works a lot better if you are using Facebook a lot. For Twitter, the feeds did not load up as fast I would expect and that was a little problematic.

I use **Tweet Deck** to manage my Twitter account. With **RockMelt **I was expecting a browser that could allow me to do the same thing in the browser itself. After using it for a couple of hours I do not think I will do away with Tweet Deck or any other social networking application. The problem with RockMelt is that it does not bring anything new to the table.

RockMelt to me seems like a fancier version of Chrome. If that is all that RockMelt will offer me, I might as well stick to Chrome and search for some good extensions. The developers should have stuck to releasing some new plugins for Chrome rather than come up with a new browser. ðŸ˜›
