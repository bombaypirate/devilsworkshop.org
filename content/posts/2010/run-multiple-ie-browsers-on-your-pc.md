A web designer wants his web-site to be visually same across all the browsers.  Amongst other browsers or even the latter incarnations of Internet Explorer, i.e. IE 6 which is a very different animal.

We always want to test  web-sites in various IE versions IE6,  IE7 and IE8 for browser compatibility. But it is always difficult to test on different machines.

## Different Ways to Test Website on Various Versions of IE

  * What I used to do is to install 3 operating systems on a machine for IE testing, but it consumes a lot of time.
  * We can also make use of IE Tester but in some cases I found this unreliable, so I prefered to avoid it.

But I came across an excellent way to run multiple version of Internet Explorer on standalone computer.
