Have you ever excitedly looked up a video on You Tube with a fast connection and unfortunately it starts to mock your internet speed by not streaming the video as fast as it should ?

Watching **You Tube** videos can be a little frustrating sometimes as the videos do often get stuck. I came across on the internet a Video Accelerator for You Tube specifically.

Its called** SpeedBit Video Accelerator** and it works automatically with any browser while viewing You Tube videos. It is a free download but there is also a premium version.

  * Once you download and install **SpeedBit**, it seamlessly integrates and works with any browser while playing any video on **You Tube**.
  * It has a separate feature meant only for** High Definition** video acceleration.
  * Considering the madness for **Twitter** is it no surprise new applications try integrate sharing through Twitter.** Speed Bit** is not exception and it also has a feature to tweet the video while you are watching on You Tube. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I think there are many video accelerators out there but I kind of like this one as I can easily share videos on my Twitter account. As far as the performance of the accelerator, I think it is quite useful for high speed internet connections. Slower speeds might not have much use for it but I guess a more seamless viewing experience should be expected.

If you like this acceleration or have any alternative applications out there let me know through your comments. ðŸ˜‰
