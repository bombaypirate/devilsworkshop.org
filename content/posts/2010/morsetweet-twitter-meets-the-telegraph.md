  Way back in the 1840s the telegraph changed the way the world communicated. Messages were passed across hundreds of miles within seconds. All this was because of the Morse Code used by the Telegraph system. The world was smaller place suddenly.
  
  Twitter has done something similar. It has managed to get people from different places and interests to share and communicate about anything and everything that is happening around the world. With Morse Tweet I could send tweets in Morse code. :-)

Way back in the 1840s the telegraph changed the way the world communicated. Messages were passed across hundreds of miles within seconds. All this was because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code', 'Morse Code']);" >Morse Code</a> used by the Telegraph system.

Twitter has done something similar. It has managed to get people from different places and interests to share and communicate about anything and everything that is happening around the world. With **Morse Tweet** I could send tweets in Morse code. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30866" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/morsetweet-twitter-meets-the-telegraph/twitter_telegraph_morse_code/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30866" title="Twitter_telegraph_morse_code" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/Twitter_telegraph_morse_code.png" alt="" width="473" height="236" /></a>

  1. Visit <a href="http://www.morsetweet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.morsetweet.com/', 'Morse Tweet']);" >Morse Tweet</a> website and just type in your message.
  2. The message is then converted into a Morse code. Morse code is in many dots and dash per character and hence we can only send messages up to 45 characters. üòê
  3. The tweet is displayed in the code along with a link. Clicking on the link can take you to the message in English. üòÄ

From a practical point of view I do not think it serves any purpose except it would be fun to send some secret tweets to people who do not know about this. Well I guess if you are reading this post, the secret is out. üòõ
