We all spend our maximum time online, thus it’s very common that we need to share files frequently with our friends. I have used many file sharing sites, but I like WeTransfer most. It is the quickest way to share your files with your friends.

WeTransfer.com is a [web application][1] which allows you to share large files and the best part you don’t need any kind of registration while sharing files. Here are few features of WeTransfer:

  * Files are available upto 2 weeks
  * Your and yours friends Email Id will be kept as private
  * You can share files with 20 friends simultaneously
  * Inbuilt Virus Scanner to make safe transfer
  * No registration required
