**Norman Rockwell&#8217;s birthday**, the 3rd February is being celebrated by **Google **in their own way with an all new Google Doodle which is actually designed with Norman Rockwell&#8217;s painting.

<img class="size-full wp-image-19251  aligncenter" title="Norman Rockwell Google Doodle" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/Norman-Rockwell-Google-Doodle.JPG" alt="Norman Rockwell Google Doodle" width="609" height="287" />

Many of you must have noticed the <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=Equitipz&meta=&aq=f&oq=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=Equitipz&meta=&aq=f&oq=', 'Google Search Engine']);" target="_blank">Google Search Engine</a> homepage today. I also saw the same and rolled over the mouse on the Doodle and came to know of the mystery behind, with a tool-tip saying &#8220;*Norman Rockwell&#8217;s Birthday &#8211; © 1926 SEPS by Curtis Publishing*&#8220;. I clicked on it and was taken to the search for the web-pages having all the information about **Norman Rockwell**.

**Norman Rockwell** was born February 3rd 1894 and died November 8th 1978. He is famous as a renowned 20th century American painter and artist.

Rockwell had his first breakthrough in art in 1912 when he was 18-years-old and from that point on, he never looked back.

>   In 1913, the nineteen-year old Rockwell became the art editor for <em>Boys&#8217; Life</em>, published by the Boy Scouts of America, a post he held for three years (1913–1916).[2] As part of that position, he painted several covers, beginning with his first published magazine cover, <em>Scout at Ship&#8217;s Wheel</em>, appearing on the <em>Boys&#8217; Life</em> September 1913 edition.
