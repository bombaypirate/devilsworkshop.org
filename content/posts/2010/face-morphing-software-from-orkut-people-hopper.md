Face morphing is one of the technology which I personally enjoy a lot. Converting a boy into a girl, converting a man into tiger or any other animal and so on. This is fascinating to me and I’m sure those who have tried other Face morphing software will enjoy Face morphing a lot.

Google has released an application for Orkut named as People hopper which will let you morph any of your friend face into other friend face and you can see the cycle of changes.

Though  <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/google-face-morphing-in-orkut/12663/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.labnol.org/internet/google-face-morphing-in-orkut/12663/', 'other orkut user']);" rel="nofollow"  target="_blank">other orkut user</a> reported that this application is not working into their account but it seems to be working fine for my Orkut profile. Note : I tested this on Google powered chrome browser.

Have you tried this face morphing application yet? Do  let me know if this is working for you or not.
