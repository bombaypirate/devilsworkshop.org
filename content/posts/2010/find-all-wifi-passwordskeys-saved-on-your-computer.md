Since I got a laptop almost 11 months ago, I have been able to do my internet surfing at various places. The office, place where I stay, a cousin&#8217;s apartment and even back at my parents place. The great thing about saved WiFi passwords it that I can just open my laptop and it gets connected to the correct network with the correct password.

Now with so many WiFi passwords around, there is a fair chance you have forgotten some of them. This happened to me a couple of days ago. A cousin came over at my place and asked me for the WiFi password so he also could go online. I had forgotten the password. I was at work at the time and did not want him to get into the admin page of my router.

Thankfully Wireless Key View came to the rescue! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Just download **WirelessKeyView** from Nirsoft and run the software. You will see all the various Wifi connections you have connected to with your laptop.

This will also show you all the WEP or WPA keys stored on your computer. Can be useful to write them all down somewhere if you are the forgetful type. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
