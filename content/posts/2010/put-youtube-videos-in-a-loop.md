**You Tube** is a great way to look up videos especially if you have a decently fast internet connection. I often watch video from tech reviews, to documentaries and sometimes I love catching a song. **You Tube** is a great repository of music just as it is of videos. So playing a great song on You Tube is something many of us do a lot. The problem with You Tube is that unlike a media player on the computer we cannot get the song to play repeatedly. Well that problem is solved now.

YouTube Repeater is a website which puts the video you are playing on You Tube in a continuous loop. You can search for videos in You Tube with the website itself.

These is another method which is when you are watching a Video on Youtube then you just need to change **&#8220;youtube.com&#8221;** to **&#8220;youtuberepeater.com&#8221;**. Changing the name of the domain puts the video in a loop. ðŸ˜‰

I still prefer using [Chrome extension CoolIris for viewing and browsing for Videos online in You Tube][1] but a continous loop is not present in that extension. I must say I like this idea of putting a video in a loop.

Do check out <a href="http://www.youtuberepeater.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtuberepeater.com/', 'Youtube Repeater']);" ><strong>Youtube Repeater</strong></a> to try out this feature and let me know what you think of it through your comments.
