Wow, one more feather has been added to Facebook now. According to comScore, Facebook has overtaken Yahoo and has become the third largest website.

Facebook became the fourth largest website some 18 months ago. Facebook is the top most social networking site now. It keeps <a href="http://fbknol.com/latest-changes-in-facebooks-chat-feature/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/latest-changes-in-facebooks-chat-feature/', 'updating its features ']);" >updating its features </a>and new things and keeps us busy. As we can see the graph below that till october Yahoo was leading the place with 600,000 plus unique visits. But, very soon that is in November the graph showed that Facebook&#8217;s total unique visits increased from 400,000 plus to 600,000 plus unique visits.

Why do you think people stopped using Yahoo now? Whatever may be the reason, I am too happy with its success. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> With this speed I guess one day Facebook will overcome Google and I am sure that will be the greatest win by Mark Zuckerberg. What do you think about, feel free to share your views with me.
