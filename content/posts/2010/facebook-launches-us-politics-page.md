Facebook has changed the way people interact amongst each other. To reach out to a younger demograph usually the best bet is social networks and YouTube on the internet and when it comes to social networks the best bet is Facebook. So it is no wonder we see many US politicians having a <a href="http://fbknol.com/watch-what-you-put-up-as-your-status-as-it-ends-up-on-communities-pages-which-are-public/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/watch-what-you-put-up-as-your-status-as-it-ends-up-on-communities-pages-which-are-public/', 'Facebook Page']);" ><strong>Facebook Page</strong></a>** **which allows them to reach out to people from across country if not the world.

This <a href="http://www.facebook.com/uspolitics" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/uspolitics', 'US Politics Page']);" >US Politics Page</a> which is dedicated to news and links to be shared related to US Politics. There is also a a link for voters to Register to vote for upcoming elections in the United States. This page is similar to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Sports" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/Sports', 'Facebook&#8217;s sports page']);" >Facebook&#8217;s sports page</a>.

This is a great trend by politicians to interact with their voters online through Facebook. It would be nice to see Indian politicians also show some proactive interest in engaging with the urban youth through Facebook and other social networks.

What do you think about Social networking groups and pages related to politics?
