  * Coloreminder has a huge palette of colors to choose from. I could just hover over a color with the mouse I got most of the details like the Hex code.
  * On click the hex code is displayed and can be copied for use. It also allows customizing the color further in detail.
  * This basically gives me the perfect color which I want displayed. It requires hardly any struggling with cheat codes and trying to look up correct codes. This site does it all for me along with giving me the **technical name**, **hexadecimal** and **RGB value**.
