Whether we want to watch a movie, read some online ebooks or just search the internet for travel plans we need our friend&#8217;s advice. Facebook has made our lives easier before also, through the instant personalization with <a href="http://fbknol.com/scribd-gets-facebook-personalization/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/scribd-gets-facebook-personalization/', 'Scribd']);" >Scribd</a> and <a href="http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/', 'Rotten tomatoes']);" >Rotten tomatoes</a>, now it is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2F&h=924b3" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2F&h=924b3', 'TripAdvisor&#8217;s']);" >TripAdvisor&#8217;s</a> turn.

Yes, now you can plan your trips to other places, get the reviews and more, all from your friends. <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=469511267130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=469511267130', 'Facebook has personalized TripAdvisor now']);" >Facebook has personalized TripAdvisor now</a>.

## What is the difference now?

  * You can see where all your friends have been and take the review from them.
  * You get reviews of hotels, restaurants etc from your friends.
  * Planning on something we do need our friends view in them.
