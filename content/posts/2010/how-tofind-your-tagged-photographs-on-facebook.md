Do you want to know where your photos are posted on Facebook by your friends and acquaintance ? Well then this will prove to be the best application for you. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?v=info&ref=ts&id=46394448355" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?v=info&ref=ts&id=46394448355', 'Photo  Finder']);" >Photo Finder</a> is produced by face.com and is still in its earlier stages. So there can be errors or bugs, development is going on.

## How does it work?

Once you have given this application the access, it will scan all your photos that you or your friends may have put in to their album. It uses a face recognition technology to find out the face. Once it has found a photo of you it will send you a notification and you can choose to tag them or ask to remove. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

You can add some people in the watch list also so that you may get the notification when they add photos. This application will be helpful when you don&#8217;t have time and you have to search for all of your photos online on Facebook immediately. I will be writing about other photo applications on Facebook, in the coming days. If you know of any other such application do share it with me  through the comments below.
