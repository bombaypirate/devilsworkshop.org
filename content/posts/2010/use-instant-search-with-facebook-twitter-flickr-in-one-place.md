Google instant has been a hit and we have had many spin-off versions of it with [Instant YouTube][1] and also [playing instant videos and adding to a list][2].

Sometimes I like using search on Twitter with Google Instant. Now Google has spoilt me and I want Twitter search to be instant. I tried doing that on Google search by using the “site:” operator but once that is entered instant results do not show up.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31468" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/use-instant-search-with-facebook-twitter-flickr-in-one-place/instant_search_multiple_sites/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31468" title="instant_search_multiple_sites" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/instant_search_multiple_sites.png" alt="" width="550" height="309" /></a>

With <a href="http://instantise.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://instantise.com/', 'Instantise']);" >Instantise</a> I could get instant results with Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and many more sites with content.

## Features of <a href="http://instantise.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://instantise.com/', 'Instantise']);" >Instantise</a>

  * Just visit the **<a href="http://instantise.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://instantise.com/', 'Instantise web-page']);" >Instantise web-page</a>**. It opens with Google search page with options at the top to navigate.
  * At the top you can choose from social networks like Twitter and Facebook. I could also carry out of an instant search of **RSS Feeds**, **Flickr **photos and even **Wikipedia**.
  * At the moment the search does not show up the suggest feature and only shows instantaneous results of the search query. The site developer claims to update the new feature sometime soon.

This is basically borrowing of ideas Google Instant and applying to different portals. This one stop shop for instant results is handy and personally I like using Wikipedia search with its instant results.

Do you like instant search more than normal search? Do drop in your comments.
