Ever wanted to search people or a specific post on **Facebook **without being logged in? Well here is how. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> A 20-year-old student in Dubai named <a href="http://syron.alanoor.com/2010/09/facebook-instant.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://syron.alanoor.com/2010/09/facebook-instant.html', 'Nour Syron']);" ><strong>Nour Syron</strong></a> has created <a href="http://syron.alanoor.com/2010/09/facebook-instant.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://syron.alanoor.com/2010/09/facebook-instant.html', 'Facebook Instant Search']);" ><strong>Facebook Instant Search</strong></a>. One morning he got up and checked his msn to see his latest messages and discovered about the guy who got job by creating [you tube instant][1]. Nour thought how about Facebook Instant now. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### What was the need of creating Facebook Instant Search ?

  * Search Facebook instantly (including posts, pages and updates).

  * Searching in your friends’ posts, status, comments is possible after you login.

  * Without logging in, you will still be able to search in public posts.

  * No history saved on your disk

  * All the searches and the results are shown in one page!!

  * Easy usage as you just need to start typing and the results will show up instantly.

Wow, hats off to him. You can have a look yourself  <a href="http://www.fbinstant.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fbinstant.net/', 'here']);" >here</a>. He still has some issues which need to be solved. Where is **Mark Zuckerberg**, is he not going to hire him or at least appreciate this person?  In his blog he has also mentioned about some problems with which he is trying to deal alone. Don&#8217;t you think he should get some support from people who can help! I think everyone should appreciate what he has come up with and anyone who can help him should come ahead and do so. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
