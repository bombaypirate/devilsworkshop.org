In Windows, you generally take notes on notepad. It is a useful tool but while working on a browser, switching to notepad for taking notes is a time consuming process.

If you are a Firefox user, then you can use **Scribbly Firefox** extension to take notes quickly right inside the browser. You can also create to-do lists or write any important points which strike during an online work.

Download and install the extension. After restarting the browser, you’ll get the Scribbly icon on the bottom right of your Firefox browser. Click on the icon to open this tool.
