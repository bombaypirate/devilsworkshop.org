Google Search is fast becoming a favorite place for internet users to look up images online. Often we bloggers use Google image search for looking up cool images. For some reason as all things Google, its image search layout of images is quite basic and functional. Seriously Google should have a cooler way of showing images.

Well **Google** has now introduced a new way to look at **Google images**. I must admit it is quite attractive. It is now only available on <a href="http://www.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/', 'Google.com']);" >Google.com</a> and not with <a href="http://google.co.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.co.in', 'Google.co.in']);" >Google.co.in</a>.

### New Features of Google Image Search

  * Browsing can be done quickly with the keyboard to scroll up and down faster and as the images are a larger its easier to zone into what you might be really looking for.
  * Also a great feature is when you hover the mouse over an image it gets highlighted and slightly zoomed version of it shows up.
  * The great part is the you can keep scrolling downwards and it shows up to a 1000 images on the single page showing image results.
  * The landing page is also new. The image is highlighted with the webpage behind it giving a good idea of the webpage you are visiting.

This is quite a nifty feature and one of the best way to look up images online and is quite inline with [YouTube&#8217;s leanback feature][1]. It also is coolest way to look up images after the [Cooliris extension with Chrome][2].
