It was developed to take care of 1-to-1 redirection between old Blogger.com posts and new WordPress blog. Over the time, we launched a professional service for Blogger to WordPress Migration and many users thought that they will never see any update for our free and open-source plugin again. Proving them wrong, we gladly announce release of a new version of our old-plugin with exciting new features.

### New Features

  * Zero changes requires on WordPress-side. Plugin handles everything automatically on WordPress.
  * New configuration wizard help you setup redirection without much efforts.
  * Supports importing from multiple Blogger.com blogs.
  * Add supports for &#8220;rel=canonical&#8221; & &#8220;meta-refresh&#8221; tags on Blogger.com which will speed-up redirection. This will help search engine update their index faster.

### Credits:

The plugin comes bundled with experience of [Nitun][2], our BloggerToWP service head, who has handled more than 100 migrations this year. If you really like user-interface of this plugin, the credit goes to Rakshit, new developer at rtCamper with good aesthetic taste! **Link: <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/blogger-to-wordpress-redirection-plugin" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/blogger-to-wordpress-redirection-plugin', 'Blogger to WordPress Redirection Plugin']);" >Blogger to WordPress Redirection Plugin</a>**
