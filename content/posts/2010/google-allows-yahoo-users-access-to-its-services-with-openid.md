Yahoo has many people who prefer to use their email services. This ends up making a large chunk of internet users stay away from **Google **services like **Google Reader **and **Google AdWords**. First Google allowed people to register to its various services using a sign-up. A **Yahoo **or **Hotmail **email address could be used to register.

Now Google has with the help of <a href="http://openid.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://openid.net/', 'Open ID']);" >Open ID</a> has made it easier for Yahoo users to sign up for services by Google.

*Yahoo Users get to sign up directly with Google services thanks to Open ID. *

## How does Open ID work for Google?

  * Until today when someone signed up with a Yahoo email address for a Google service like Google Reader or Google Groups they were sent a verification email.
  * A link had to be clicked for the registration to be complete. This was a security measure against getting spam registrations.
  * As Yahoo and Google both are part of Open ID project. Google allows the verification to be done through Open ID and not sending a verification link to the email.

### How does this help Google?

It is quite easy to sign up to a Google service with a Yahoo email address. This means Google will now entice Yahoo users to their services. No email verification anymore.

This basically makes the sign-up process more continuous. One scenario that is often seen with new sign-up is people when they have to go back to verify their email address choose to do it after a while. This will be avoided and people will simply register and start using the Google service.

### Will this work the other way round?

Will you be allowed to sign-up and register directly to a Yahoo service with a Gmail address. The answer is unfortunately &#8216;No&#8217;. Yahoo services will still need Google users to verify their account.

## What are other advantages to Google?

This might not mean a lot of users actually abandoning Yahoo. But my guess is that Google might be planning to use this to lure Yahoo email users onto [their Social network][1]. At the end of the day one has to keep in mind that Facebook too is part of OpenID. ðŸ˜‰

What do you think of the latest development with Google and its Open ID friendly feature? How will it impact Yahoo and Google? Do drop in your comments and views.
