Many people have obsessed on the time it takes for a site to load up on the browser. Recently, Google had declared that how fast your website gets loaded will have an impact on SEO or page ranks.

I think when it comes to blogs, speed might not have such an adverse impact but I am sure it got a lot of bloggers wondering how their website performed when compared for speed with others (competitors). <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a href="http://whichloadsfaster.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://whichloadsfaster.com/', 'Which loads Faster']);" >Which loads Faster</a> is a website that tests loading speed for two different websites from one page itself and compares them.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-29586" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/check-loading-speed-of-multiple-websites/whichloadsfaster/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29586" title="whichloadsfaster" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/whichloadsfaster.png" alt="" width="550" height="371" /></a>

### Features of <a href="http://whichloadsfaster.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://whichloadsfaster.com/', 'Which loads Faster']);" >Which loads Faster</a>

  * The image above showed two websites being tested for loading speed. We used [Devils&#8217; Workshop][1] and <a href="http://wpveda.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpveda.com', 'wpVeda']);" >wpVeda</a>.
  * There are added features or repeating tests and capturing data.
  * Another interesting feature is **Race. **This allows multiple websites to load up and be tested in a group. The group with fasted loading speeds wins the race. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Apart from Google looking at loading speed, a site which is slow can finally end up frustrating visitors too. So it would be a nice idea to compare your website for speed against some popular ones.

Do try out <a href="http://whichloadsfaster.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://whichloadsfaster.com/', 'Which loads Faster']);" >Which loads Faster</a> and share with us what are your views on loading speed for websites? Are they any important? Do drop in your comments.
