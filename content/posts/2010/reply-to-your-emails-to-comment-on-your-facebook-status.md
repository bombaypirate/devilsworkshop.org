If you use Facebook and have activated the “<a href="http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?notifications" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?notifications', 'Email notifications']);" >Email notifications</a>” feature to receive emails for any comments on your status messages then you will probably love this feature. You can now comment on any of your status updates simply by replying to the Email notification that you receive from Facebook when your friends comment on it.

### Reply to Comments via E-mail

Here’s a screenshot of an email notification I received from Facebook this morning:

[<img class="wp-image-50360" style="border-right-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="facebook-reply via email" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/01/facebookreplyviaemail_thumb.png" width="489" height="236" />][1] 

I was excited to test this feature, following which, without waiting anymore I just hit the ‘reply’ button and sent a “test message” and what next? The same comment was published on the thread within seconds.. 

[<img style="border-right-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="facebook-reply via email1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/01/facebookreplyviaemail1_thumb.png" width="493" height="275" />][2] 

While I figure out few more things about this new feature, do keep enjoying it! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
