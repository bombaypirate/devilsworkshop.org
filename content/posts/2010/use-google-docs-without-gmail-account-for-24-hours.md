Google Docs is favorite of mine and pretty much to the extent that I did not bother to install Microsoft Office. With the [newer format and re-design of Google Docs][1] I pretty much think there is very little difference between Google Docs and its paid alternatives.

But to get more customers and newer customers to get interested in using Docs, Google has a demo page which allows for creating documents which are automatically saved for upto 24 hours and with **no need to sign in to a Google account.**

  * The best part of this is on the top right corner is a URL where the **Google Document** is stored.
  * **Only Text** documents, **spread sheets**, **drawing documents** can be created and shared with a temporary URL.
  * I personally do not think Text documents are of any real value if its being saved only for 24 hours but spreadsheets with formulas and interesting [flow chart diagrams with Google Drawings][2].

Do try out <a href="https://docs.google.com/demo" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/demo', 'Google Docs Demo']);" >Google Docs Demo</a> and let me know if saving temporary documents will be useful for you? Do drop in your comments.
