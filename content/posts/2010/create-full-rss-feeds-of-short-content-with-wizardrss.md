As a blogger I end up subscribing to many feeds and one of the key issues I have with some websites and their RSS feeds is that the feeds only show the title of the page along with a short summary. This can be a little annoying as in many cases the post itself is not really interesting but title is quite interesting. This means you have to visit the URL for reading the complete post or article.

Here **WizardRSS** comes to the rescue.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-23174" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/create-full-rss-feeds-of-short-content-with-wizardrss/wizardrss_create_full_rss/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23174" title="WizardRSS_create_full_RSS" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/WizardRSS_create_full_RSS.png" alt="" width="411" height="82" /></a>

### **About <a href="http://www.wizardrss.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wizardrss.com/', 'WizardRSS']);" >WizardRSS</a>**

  * WizardRSS is a great service where all you have to do is enter the RSS URL which show short content and with a single click you can get a new RSS feed for the same URL but through WizardRSS which shows the entire article.
  * A cool feature of it is that I did not even have to visit the WizardRSS website for creating the full RSS feeds. I could do it directly but adding something before the URL address.
  * For example, to create a full RSS feed of ***http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/topstories ***just add ***www.wizardrss.com*** before feed address. Which means ***http://www.wizardrss.com/feed/rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/topstories ***will show the RSS feeds with their full articles.

I found this quite useful and it even worked fine with certain [search results I had created RSS feeds][1] or even [checking webpage changes with Google Reader][2].

Do try it out <a href="http://www.wizardrss.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wizardrss.com/', 'WizardRSS']);" >WizardRSS</a> and let me know what do you think about it? Do drop in your comments with your views and any new similar tools you might be using for creating long RSS feeds of short ones.
