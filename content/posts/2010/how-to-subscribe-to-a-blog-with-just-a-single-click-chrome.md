This is one is for Chrome enthusiasts who also like to subscribe to various blogs. I love to read and hence I end up subscribing to a lot of different blogs. They can range from tech to history. I use **Google Reader** as I can easily [share what I liked through Twitter and Facebook][1]. But the subscribing process sometimes is quite tedious, especially if the subscription button is not easy to find.

### RSS Subscription for Chrome Browser

  * Download the **Chrome** Extension named <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd', 'RSS  Subscribtion']);" >RSS Subscribtion</a>
  * Once installed onto your Chrome browser, go ahead and look up a website.
  * Now at end of the address bar you can see the subscribe symbol appearing if that website has subscription enabled through RSS feeds. Just click on from the address bar for subscribing.
  * As long as your are signed into your reader, its added to the reader automatically.

This extension is quite useful especially as not all websites make it very easy for us to be able to locate their RSS subscribe button very easily. Also some websites which are not really blogs but are sending regular updates might not bother with having easy access to their feeds. In this case** RSS Subscribtion** is perfect as it automatically checks if RSS feed is available. A single click and you are a subscriber. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
