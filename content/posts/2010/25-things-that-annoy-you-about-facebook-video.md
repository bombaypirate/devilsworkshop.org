**Facebook** has been criticized lately for privacy concerns and some people even thought they should <a href="http://fbknol.com/did-you-quit-facebook-on-quit-facebook-day/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/did-you-quit-facebook-on-quit-facebook-day/', 'Quit Facebook']);" >Quit Facebook</a>. Well for all the criticism and some angry users, Facebook still has not really had a very bad fallout and pretty much is still growing and working on new ways to makes make money.
