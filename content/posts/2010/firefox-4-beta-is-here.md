A couple of day ago I wrote about [Firefox losing out in the long run against Google Chrome][1] when it came to browser market share. This was mainly due to Firefox number stagnating and Chromes doubling in the past 10 months. The one thing that most Firefox users were looking forward to is here. Firefox 4 beta version is out. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### **What&#8217;s special about Firefox 4 beta?**

  * The first thing after I downloaded Firefox 4 was that it was super light and fast. But then I immediately I realized that all the Add-ons were disabled.
  * I tried to check if I could enable all the add-ons and then check Firefox for speed but all Add-ons currently were incompatible with Firefox 4 beta. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * That apart I was quite happy with the new look of Firefox 4 which does give that Chrome&#8217;s neatness but with a Firefox identity.

Just be aware the the add-ons are not compatible as of now but should be very soon once developers update their add-ons.

What are your views on Firefox 4? Will it be the best browser from Mozilla Firefox or has it come a little too late in the day? Do drop in your comments.
