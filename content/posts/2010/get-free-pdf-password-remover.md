PDF files are very useful and at times very frustration. Sometimes work** pdf** files have passwords to protect them but it is not always a good idea. A password is sometimes quite a problem when people using a **pdf** document are working collaboratively.

Thanks to details provided by a **DW** follower Owen Lee, I got to know that a software which removes password from protected **PDF** documents can be downloaded and used for free. This is part of a giveaway by <a href="http://www.anypdftools.com/pdf-password-remover.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.anypdftools.com/pdf-password-remover.html', 'Any PDF Tools']);" >Any PDF Tools</a>.

  * This is not a hack tool, you can remove password restrictions applied by the author only if you know the original password.
  * Just download the tool and install it. Open a** .pdf** file with a password and remove the restrictions.
  * This allows the user to copy, edit and even print the document without the restrictions.
  * It is a stand alone application which does not require Adobe reader or Acrobat on your computer.
  * Best feature is Batch Decryption which allows the decryption of 200 Acrobat files at once.

So if you want to download the PDF Password Remover go ahead and download it. Do download it fast as it is being made available for free only until 24th Februdary 2010.
