Sharing photos and tagging people has always been my favourite part of Facebook. I love Facebook for this facility.

Some days before I noticed that **Facebook** is prompting photo&#8217;s on the right hand side column of my home page while I was going through the **photo galleries**. It says to **tag** the person in the photo. Facebook has released a new **feature** which pops up notifications as you browse through the photo galleries.

It is due to the Facebook’s recent integration of **facial recognition** software into their service. Earlier **photo tagging** did have its pitfalls as the tagged photo was not clear that is we could not make out the exact person as the tags were overlapping in many cases.

But just as I was getting used to it and enjoying this feature, I noticed something weird when I was going through the photo gallery.

Originally the image was like this as below:

I read on Allfacebook how Facebook is prompting friends to be tagged on photos which have no people in them.I saw something similar when I was prompted to **tag** some pictures of **laptops**.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-cool-is-face-recognition-by-facebook/odd-tag-4/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-cool-is-face-recognition-by-facebook/odd-tag-4/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2692"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2692" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/odd-tag3.png" alt="" width="254" height="171" /></a>

The image above is the **laptop** of one of our rtCampers and see it is asking to tag a laptop&#8217;s image. It was so funny to see this image. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We at **rtCamp** love our gadgets but I am still not ready to make them human as Facebook suggests.  
Where should I tag a person here ? Where is the so called &#8216;Face recognition&#8217; here?

I just wonder why no matter how much Facebook try to be good and interesting something so weird and funny like this happens. Do they need a better set of developers or it is just that such things keep happening by chance? What do you think ? Feel free to write your views on this. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
