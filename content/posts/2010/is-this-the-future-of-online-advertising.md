Google Adsense is the preferred way for most blogs to showcase ads and earn revenues. Google Adsense and Ad-words make a lot of sense considering most people do not mind text based links as ads. They are a lot less inconvenient than those pesky and irritating flash pop-ups ads.

Here is a new way of showing ads which **Digg.com** has come up with and it is apparently making a lot of revenues for **Digg**.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-20780" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/is-this-the-future-of-online-advertising/digg_ads_future_online_advertising/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20780" style="border: 1px solid teal" title="Digg_ads_future_online_advertising" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/Digg_ads_future_online_advertising.png" alt="" width="550" height="250" /></a>

  * As you can see in the image above, when you visit Digg.com the third post from top is a advertisement.
  * You can actually have readers Share it or Bury it but as you can see in the image readers cannot comment on it.
  * The way the revenues work is the more often people share it or read the link the lesser the advertisers pay.

I don&#8217;t think this sort of advertising can really make a big difference to **Google Adsense** and it&#8217;s relevance but it might change the way paid reviews are being used in blogs. The concept is that let&#8217;s say a company pays a blog for writing a review. The blog displays it and has a way of it being rated in terms of page views or even being voted by readers. It could also be a rated in terms of getting traffic to the blog. The higher the traffic the post brings the lower the advertisers have to pay. ðŸ˜‰

I don&#8217;t think we will be seeing this system making its way to your favorite blogs in the immediate future but I think this could be the future of online advertising atleast when it comes to blogs.What do you think? Do drop in your comments.
