Sharing and cross-sharing of information across platforms is the new trend and very useful if you want to cover various forums to disseminate information. For a blogger it is vital to distribute links to their posts across various platforms. Here is where I found **Flexamail** quite handy. It is a service which allows you to send and retrive information to **Twitter** and **Facebook **without even the need to visit any webpage. All you need is to log into your email account.

### About Flexamail?

  * First I needed to register with **Flexamail** with my **Email Id**.
  * The I had to configure with my **username** and **password** for **Facebook** and **Twitter**.
  * Finally I was set to start using Twitter and Facebook with my Email account.

### How does it work?

  * When I sent a email to particular email address of **Flexamail** I could send a tweet and update my Facebook wall.
  * What I type in the **subject line** is sent over as a **tweet** while what is in the **body of the email message** is posted on your **Facebook Wall**.
  * It also has other options to check 10 recent wall updates, 20 tweets from friends and also helpful in sharing images. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

*Here is a short video demo I made while I tested Flexamail*



**Examples:**

tweet@flexamail.com *(sends subject line as tweet on twitter)*  
fbwall@flexamail.com *(sends email body as post on Facebook Wall)*

Try it out but visiting <a href="http://flexamail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flexamail.com', 'Flexamail']);" >Flexamail</a> and use your email to control Facebook and Twitter account. Let me know your view through your comments.
