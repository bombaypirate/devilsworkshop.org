Last time I had written post on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/ultrasurf-free-desktop-proxy-software-to-unblock-any-website/" target="_blank">Download ultra surf: Free desktop proxy software to unblock any website</a>. Till now I’m using it effectively and it is helping me a lot to remove internet censorship.  This tutorial is for all those who are not aware of how they can use Ultra surf proxy software.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/ultrasurf-free-desktop-proxy-software-to-unblock-any-website/" target="_blank">Download ultra surf</a> and once download is completed. Simply start the software. Once you will run this software, it will try to connect to its server and if it’s successfully connected. You can start browsing directly from Internet explorer.

### How to Connect if I’m behind a Proxy firewall?

In some colleges and office, you need proxy settings to access internet. In this case open Ultra surf, click on options and configure your proxy settings to connect to internet. Now it will connect to its server using your provided proxy settings.

### How to configure different browsers to use Ultra surf settings ?

When you open Ultra surf, it will automatically configure your Internet explorer settings to use Ultra surf proxy settings. But if you want to use it on other browser like Mozilla firefox or anything else, you need to change the proxy settings of browser to use :

  * **IP : 127.0.0.1**
  * **Port : 9666**

I hope this tutorial will help you a lot to access useful sites which are accidentally blocked due to your firewall software or hardware in your organization.

***Do let us know which other software do you use apart from Ultra surf ?***
