Internet is an ocean of knowledge. But getting the correct resources from this huge ocean is not an easy task. Newbie generally face problems in finding the correct resources for learning.

There is a nice search engine for such users known as **TheGuideDB** by which they can search for various nifty tutorials in few seconds. It is different from normal search engine because it searches only for PDF documents having content like tutorials and guides.

<img class="wp-image-50133" style="border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/theguidedb.png" border="0" alt="theguidedb" width="591" height="353" />

To use this database, type the keyword in the search box and hit the “Search” button, it will redirect you to the available resources.

I found some useful tutorials of WordPress and blogging using this search engine. The other advantage of using this site is it suggests some nice related resources in the sidebar.

Using this site is free of cost and it doesn’t require any registration process. There are total 47.700.000 guides present in the database which is obviously huge in amount. There is a link of top guide and recent guides present on the homepage that can make your search easier.

Check out all the [tutorials we have on Devils&#8217; Workshop][1]. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Top guide contains guide on Apple Iphone, Game, chord, Panasonic, Tv, Dvd and many other objects.
