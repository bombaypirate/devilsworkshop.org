Apart from browsing Twitter, Facebook and [playing online games][1], many times people search for funny videos on sites like YouTube and Metacafe to get rid of boring moments in life. TinkrRoulette is a website which has awesome collection of funny videos. This site has a video collection from the top video hosting sites like YouTube, Google Videos, DailyMotion and Metacafe.

When you visit the site, you don’t need to search for videos. It automatically assign four random videos and displays it to the home page. These videos are fetched from more than 30 video hosting sites. Click the play button to play the video.

If you want to change the videos, just click on the “Spin” button given at the bottom. After clicking, it will show you four new videos from random sites.

If you’ll get four different videos from the same sites, i.e. four videos from YouTube on the same page then you’ll get the **jackpot**. It also displays total jackpots on the top of the page. I don’t know what’s the prize money because I didn’t hit the jackpot while spinning the videos. If you’ve got any then tell us in the comment section.
