Facebook people have denied about this story being true. But it surely will get a great response. There will be people ready to go for a movie and just get a look of Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s life. The tag line itself makes it interesting saying **&#8220;you don&#8217;t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies&#8221;** <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This could increase popularity of Facebook.This film will prove to be a great marketing strategy for Facebook. Though I dont say Facebook needs marketing I just say that one more feather will be added in Facebook&#8217;s hat. According to Mark Zuckerberg early days at his company were much boring than they are being shown and he denies to tell any thing about the movie being true or not.

Written by Aaron Sorkin of &#8220;West Wing&#8221; fame and directed by David Fincher, nominated for an Oscar for &#8220;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&#8221; the film had already gained a lot of popularity before its release. I don&#8217;t care if it is fiction or true this movie does make me interested in it.

What do you say? Any idea when is it being released in India? Who all are interested in watching this movie? Do let me know through your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
