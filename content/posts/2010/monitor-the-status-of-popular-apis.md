If you are a professional blogger or running a website, then one way to build a community is to have APIs on your website. It is very important in today&#8217;s world to have APIs because it is one way for websites to communicate with each other. Facebook, Twitter, Digg etc all have APIs available to be added to websites. API-Status is a website which monitors API&#8217;s for their up time.

### About <a href="http://api-status.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://api-status.com/', 'API-Status']);" >API-Status</a>

  * As you can see in the image the website shows if the **API service** is operating normally of it there is a downtime. For instance in the above image; **GeoNames API** is facing service disruption.
  * Clicking on one of the APIs link displays current service performance by country, a average graphical display of the daily downtime. (see image below)

  * There is a total of 30 APIs which are being monitored and I could not really think of any popular API which was not included.

This website will a great use for webmasters or developers to refer to as quick reference point for a API&#8217;s performance. It can also be a great way for developers to see how API&#8217;s perform based on country specific locations. Do try it out and drop in you comments with your views and opinions.
