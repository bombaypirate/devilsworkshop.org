YouTube yesterday <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/07/upload-limit-increases-to-15-minutes.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/07/upload-limit-increases-to-15-minutes.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that the default time limit for users uploading videos has gone up from 10 minutes to 15 minutes. If you were wondering why most videos were 10 minutes or less on YouTube was because they did not allow making a video longer than 10 minutes.

## What will it do?

If you are using YouTube for looking up tutorials like I do, it can get a little annoying to see part 1 and part 2 for longer tutorials. Having the limit go upto 15 minutes it makes it easier for publishers to have a single video show a lot more.

## How is YouTube celebrating it?

  * YouTube is starting something called 15 minutes of fame. You can create a 15 minute video of your life or about you and upload it on YouTube. You have to tag the video **&#8220;yt15minutes&#8221;**.
  * Once tagged some of these select videos will be features on YouTube&#8217;s homepage in a future spotlight. Basically this is a great way to become famous with a 15 minutes I guess. ðŸ˜‰

YouTube is always upto something fun. Be it allowing us to [create 3D formats of our videos][1] to [playing snake game while a video loads][2]. It is never short of constantly doing something cool and interesting.

Do you think 15 minute videos on YouTube will help you as viewer? Or do you think 10 minutes was more than enough? Do let me know through your comments.
