I personally feel the answer to the above question should be &#8216;YES!&#8217;. I see no harm in befriending one&#8217;s parents on Facebook unless you tend to share stuff which is not family friendly :-P. As in my case, my mom IS on my friends list and is an active Facebook user, and my dad just joined in! The following flow-chart can definitely help you to decide if your parents should be your friends on Facebook or not ! Go ahead and give it a try !<figure id="attachment_4563" style="width: 378px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">
