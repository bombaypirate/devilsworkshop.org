    Google is believed to pose a major competition to Amazon with its launch of eBooks. At present, eBookstore is only available for users in the US, however other users can access and read all the available <strong>FREE</strong> titles spread in a total of 20 categories including Fantasy, Thrillers and Romance, but they cannot purchase any titles.
