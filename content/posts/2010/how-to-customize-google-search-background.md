There has been an announcement of launching [Customized Google Background ][2]option throughout the net. We are happy to announce its launch in India.

Today, <a href="http://www.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com', 'Google']);" >Google</a> came up with custom background option in Google Search. I&#8217;m really impressed with the addon and hope that every googler will like it. Previously, it narrowed its gap with Yahoo by bringing I-Google and now it has left Bing far behind by bringing the Custom Background option. Now the other search engines don&#8217;t have a unique feature other than Google. It seems that Google has started to grab the entire Internet World and Business.

I&#8217;m adding the screenshots having details how to add it.

Step 1 : Click : &#8221; Signin to use background image&#8221;

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-26471" title="Step 1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/01-600x253.png" alt="" width="600" height="253" />][3]

Step 2 :  Sign in your account[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-26472" title="Step 2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/02-600x222.png" alt="" width="600" height="222" />][4]

Step 3 : Choose your picture. You can select over various sources like Google Image Search, Picasa, Public Gallery and Editor&#8217;s Picks.

Step 4 : Make a selection from previous step. I chose a picture from Editor&#8217;s Picks and it look like below.

Features : You can set multiple images over multiple accounts. Whenever, you login a Gmail Account, you will get your customized wallpaper at Google Search.

This feature is really cool and now Google has met up the only difference which Bing had.
