We have already seen many articles on Internet for getting URL shortener under your domain name. One major benefit for the same is branding, in WordPress 3.0, WordPress team has taken care of this. When you upgrade to WordPress 3.0, you can click on Get shortlink from dashboard to get URL shortener under your domain name.<figure id="attachment_377" style="width: 590px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

This is really useful for your brand. I wish if we can use the same for Tweetmeme link and other links to Shorten using your domain name shortener instead of bit.ly or su.pr shortener. Though this can be achieved using plugins, but default feature would be very handy.

*Meanwhile do let us know what do you think about this URL shortener under your domain name in WordPress 3.0?*
