If we trust on rumors and Twitter then something big is going to happen today evening (read Gmail killer ðŸ˜‰ ). We have heard that Facebook is going to have an email service of its own. That is something like abc@facebook.com or a total new email client.

It could be just a rumor like the<a href="http://fbknol.com/get-ready-for-a-face-phone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/get-ready-for-a-face-phone/', ' Facebook phone ']);" > Facebook phone </a>oneÂ but who knows it may be true. Facebook people refuse to give us any idea about what it exactly is. If it comes out to be a new Facebook email client then I think people will be more than excited to use it and if this is not then too Facebook has enough publicity! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Why do I think it will be a great idea?

  * Considering how many people use Facebook, imagine all those 500 million users switching to Facebook.com. Even if they do not like it that much but just for one time they all will try.
  * Based on the number of Likes, if Facebook mail tries to Â prioritize the mail it will give a better result than Gmail priority inbox.

The only doubt I have is whether this service will be provided to Facebook employees only or to everyone using Facebook. This has happened earlier also that any new service that Facebook launches is just given to some of their members or in US. I wish this time it should be given to all at once. Whereas if Facebook decides to share the email with only employees then that will not be so good. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Right now I am waiting for the real event to happen at San Francisco and know what exactly Facebook is up to. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I will soon be updating here about it. Till then keep you Twitter and Facebook open for any hint. ðŸ˜€
