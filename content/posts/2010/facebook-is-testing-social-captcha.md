After trying to own the english words  &#8216;face&#8217; and &#8216;book&#8217; now **Facebook** is trying to own &#8216;**social CAPTCHA**&#8216;. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You can read about the earlier patent at <a href="http://fbknol.com/will-facebooks-new-patent-prove-to-be-effective/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/will-facebooks-new-patent-prove-to-be-effective/', 'http://bit.ly/dqAwNx']);" >http://bit.ly/dqAwNx</a>. The term **CAPTCHA** stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”.

You must have noticed when creating a new account on Facebook and Google you are given a random text including alphabets and numbers. You have to copy that text in the given box. That is **Captcha** and when you are asked to answer a  series of questions that is **Social Captcha**.

Captchas prevent spammers on the web. By displaying pictures and asking some information may be a better way to protect the site effectively.

### What Facebook will do?

This has been in testing stages since long, now Facebook wants it to be a **patent**.

There are so many **security** threats on line.  **Spamming** is at its best so every one including  the other sites on line are trying their best to stop it.

**Pros:**

  * I think instead of random words people will find it interesting to give answers to the obvious questions.

  * When asked to identify any person on his/her friend list person would not fail until and unless it&#8217;s some random profile picture of a cat or flower. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**Cons:**

  * Ever imagine what will happen to a person who has a lot of friends and do not care to be really friends with all of them. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> In that case I think it will a problem. What if you know the person but still the picture is of his dog or a flower?

  * I think it&#8217;s an easier thing to be used. So it might be easier for attackers/spammers also. When asked to enter a random text with images I have to re-enter it many times till I am correct but in this case I do not think  I have to make so many efforts.

It is still an improvement on an ordinary **CAPTCHA**, since ordinary CAPTCHAs only protect against certain threats or attacks. At least Facebook is trying hard to be more **secure** which is a very good thing to do. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
