Now you can call your Facebook friends and enjoy Facebook and Skype together.

## Features new Skype 5.0 will have

  * You can see your** Facebook friends** on Skype.
  * You can post status updates that can be synced with your **Skype** mood messages.
  * You can **Comment and Like** Facebook friend&#8217;s updates and wall posts.
  * You can Call and MMS your Facebook friends on their mobile phones or landlines.
  * <span style="font-size: 13.3333px">You can make a free call from Skype if your friend is also having a Skype.</span>

With the new Skype you get better calling interface and great look and feel.

They have released a **Beta version** now for testing. The catch here is that it is just been out for **Windows**. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> So if you are using Linux, Mac or stuff you are just the odd one out. Why do you think they have released it only for Windows and not for other Operating systems. Well, whatever the reason we hope it will be out for other Operating systems soon. Till then watch the video below and know more about it.

Right now people are having difficulties in downloading the new Skype due to some server problems. It will soon be taken care of. Till then if anybody has downloaded the new version and used it let me know the review. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Share your experience and views on **Skype 5.0** Facebook integration through the comments below.
