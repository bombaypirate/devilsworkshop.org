Few days back facebook released a new feature name as Facebook like. This Facebook like button will let your reader quickly up vote (like) and of your post and it will be shared on his facebook wall. Since Facebook and twitter are one of the best way to drive traffic, I recommend you should add Facebook like and Tweetmeme/Twitter button into your blog.

Using it, you can quickly add Facebook like button anywhere in your blog.

This plugin comes with an option panel, which can be use to customize Facebook like button:
