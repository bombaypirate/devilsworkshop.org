There is a new phishing attack which has hit **Twitter** and I thought it would be important bit of news for our readers who are on **Twitter**. The attack spreads through a tweet with the text message &#8220;**This You????**&#8221; followed by a link. Clicking on the link spreads the phishing attack and makes your account details vulnerable.

### How it works?

  * In your Twitter time-line you will receive a tweet with the text message **&#8220;This You???&#8221; **followed by a link.
  * You might think of it as a harmless **link **and **click** on it.
  * It pulls up the log-in page for Twitter. Most people do not look up at the address bar if the page is **Twitter** or some other **URL**.
  * Person entering the account credentials is actually sending it to someone else. Once done with that it can end up sending a tweet using your credentials and hence spread further.
  * Ideally for a open and public forum like Twitter you should have a user-name and password different from your other more protected websites like Facebook, Gmail etc. Short URL&#8217;s do pose a threat as there is no way of knowing where they might lead you to.

In case you feel you are subject to such a attack best way to curb it is to change your password. That can stop it from using your account for spreading the phishing attack on Twitter. Have you faced such instances of phishing attacks on Twitter? Do let us know through your comments.
