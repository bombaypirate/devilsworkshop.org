Did anyone notice anything different or new this morning? Well, when I logged into my Facebook account and tried to add some of my Orkut friends, I could not do so.

Facebook has removed all the mention of Google&#8217;s Gmail service from its &#8220;Find your Friends&#8221; feature. Google was angry when Facebook allowed users to find new friends based on one&#8217;s contact listing within a Gmail account, but Facebook Â didn&#8217;t allow the procedure to go in reverse. In response to which Google denied Facebook to get information from it or from the contacts.

If you try to add friends from &#8220;Other email Service &#8220;link you will get a message saying &#8220;Everyone on this contact list is already on Facebook or has already been invited&#8221;, as shown below.

I think Google and Facebook are taking all this too long. Why not accept each other as an individual and try managing both the social networks together. But as <a href="http://fbknol.com/use-your-facebook-id-to-login-to-myspace/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/use-your-facebook-id-to-login-to-myspace/', 'Facebook has won the battle of social networks']);" >Facebook has won the battle of social networks</a>, it&#8217;s just not ready to consider any other website as a social networking website. Lets see what happens next? Will Gmail like MySpace allow people to login with their Facebook ID&#8217;s and fully surrender or it will come up with something new against Facebook. Drop in your comments below.
