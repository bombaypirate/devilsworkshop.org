It was created by IISc Bangalore, IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Madras took part in the research to come up with the innovative tablet meant to be cheap.

Complete list of features have not yet been revealed but here are something it will have.

  * It will be touch screen, single built unit.
  * It will have 2GB RAM and support Wi-Fi connectivity along with USB Port.

The goverment expects this device to be rolled out by 2011 and the main target are students. They expect the price to further fall to only INR 1000/- approx $20. This is obviously not as awaited as the [Adam Tablet PC][1] and was quite a surprise.

What are your views? Will it work out well for the Indian consumer? Do drop in your comments.

Here is a video below of the new device and the announcement.
