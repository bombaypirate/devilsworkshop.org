Strangely the hacker has put up a email Id out there in case someone is interested in buying the domain.

It is probably unrelated but there has been a rise in official websites being hacked into with messages. This is known as defacing homepages. Only recently [Indian government had admitted that China based hackers][1] had attacked official computers. But those were more sophisticated and meant to attack computer systems rather than deface any websites.

### DNS Attack?

It seems TCS is facing DNS attack of some kind as the homepage opens fine with <a href="http://pagewash.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pagewash.com', 'Pagewash']);" >Pagewash</a>. Here is a video to explain.
