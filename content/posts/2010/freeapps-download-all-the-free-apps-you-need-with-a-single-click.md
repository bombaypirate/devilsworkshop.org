  Almost a year ago I bought a new computer. If you are a tech lover like I am, chances are your computer is full of free applications. The painful process of searching for all these apps starts when you have a new computer.
  
  There is a great solution from FreeApps which allowed me to download all the free software, you possibly might need on your computer.

  * **FreeApps **is great as you can install all the free applications with the installer with just a single click. Just visit the website and you will see all the software that is missing on your computer arranged in neatly category wise.
  * Great feature of this website is all the downloads are done from the vendorâ€™s server. That is good to know as it means it is safe to use FreeApps to download required software.
  * It also has a new freeware section which is a great way to keep in touch with what new freeware software is out there.
