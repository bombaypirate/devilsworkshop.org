Sometimes ago, Rahul wrote a very nice article on [torrent search engines][1]. If you are searching for a rare file on torrent then switching between various search engines is a time consuming process.

**Usniff** is a nice torrent meta search engine which can search from various torrents search engines sites and displays all the results quickly. It search from approxiamtely 16 torrents search engines such as thepiratebay, torrentreactor, monova, sumotorrent, bittorent, kickasstorrents and many more.

Visit the website and type the name of movie or file you want to download and hit the magnifying glass icon. It will give a plenty of results within seconds.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-26376" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/usniff-a-meta-search-engine-for-torrent/usniff/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26376" title="usniff" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/usniff.png" alt="" width="599" height="565" /></a>

The top verified results are sponsored links by Usniff. Try to avoid them and click on the link given below them. The name of search engine, size of file, no of seeds and peers appear in from of every search result.

The good thing about this search engine it doesn’t require the signup process and it is completely free to use. It is based on Ajax therefore it is very fast.

Check out torrent meta search engine <a href="http://www.usniff.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.usniff.com/', 'Usniff']);" >Usniff</a> and write in your comments and views.
