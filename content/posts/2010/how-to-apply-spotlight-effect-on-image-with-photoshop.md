We have many options for various effects on an image with Photoshop. In this post I am going to tell you about how to apply a spotlight effect on an image.

**Why use spotlight effect?**

We can use spotlight effect for highlighting a part of the image. It is usually to show or draw attention to a particular part of the image. Sometimes spotlight effect can be used to complete give the image a different context.Â  A good example is are the images below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30252" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-apply-spotlight-effect-on-image-with-photoshop/image-1-3/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30252" title="image 1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-14-600x297.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="297" /></a>

For this tutorial I have taken the example of the image below. This image is a little dark and I like to use darker images while using spotlight effect. This is because with spotlight a darker image seems to work better overall.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30253" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-apply-spotlight-effect-on-image-with-photoshop/image-2-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30253" title="image 2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-21.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a>

We are going to highlighted the face the girl in the image.

Select the image layer and go to **Filter>Render>Lighting Effects.**

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30254" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-apply-spotlight-effect-on-image-with-photoshop/image-3-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30254" title="image 3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-31.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="384" /></a>

After **Lighting Effects **box is displayed on your screen, keep the all value as per the image below. You can free to change these value as per the nature of the image.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30255" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-apply-spotlight-effect-on-image-with-photoshop/image-4-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30255" title="image 4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-41-600x578.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="578" /></a>

Now you can see the face of the girl in the image is highlighted in comparison to the original image.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30256" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-apply-spotlight-effect-on-image-with-photoshop/image-5-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30256" title="image 5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-51.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a>

We can also change the spotlight color. This is used to create a different context to the image.

Go to **Filter>Render>Lighting Effects** and change the color. Just double-click on the color box and you can see the **selected color box** on your screen.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30257" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-apply-spotlight-effect-on-image-with-photoshop/image-6-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30257" title="image 6" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-61-600x497.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="497" /></a>

You are free to use any color for your Spotlight Effect. Here I use light **Orange** and **Yellow** color as you can see in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30258" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-apply-spotlight-effect-on-image-with-photoshop/image-7-2/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30258" title="image 7" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-71-600x563.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="563" /></a>

Below is how the image was after changing the spotlight color.

This does make the image a lot different from where we started. There are many creative ways to use spotlight effect with Photoshop. Do drop in your comments and views.
