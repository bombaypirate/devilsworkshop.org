<a rel="attachment wp-att-34987" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/download-microsoft-net-40-framework-offline-installer/microsoft_net_4/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-34987" title="Microsoft_net_4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/Microsoft_net_4.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Almost all new applications written for Windows Platform needs the .Net framework. The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 is useful for programmers and developers. The focus of .NET version 4.0 is better support for parallel extensions. The .NET framework helps out these programs to run because of features like interoperability and language independence.

This makes having Microsoft .NET 4.0 framework a must have if you are developing software or even running new applications on your Windows OS.

If we go to the Microsoft Download center, we can install the live installer. This is a small file but to install the complete .Net framework it will require an internet connection to install the almost 50 MB size framework.

If you are using a dial-up or a limited download plan on your internet, this might be a little painful to sit about waiting for the live installer to download the .net 4.0 framework.

One major advantage of downloading the offline installer is you can easily use it to install .NET Framework on multiple computers without the need to download individually from the internet.

The link is absolutely authentic as it is from Microsoft Servers. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
