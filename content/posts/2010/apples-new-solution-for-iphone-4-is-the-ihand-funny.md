Recently I wrote about [Nokia poking fun at Apple&#8217;s iPhone][1] by showing how Nokia phones can be held without ever the fear of losing connectivity. While the laughter around the net was about to die out, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we have</span> we came across a incredibly funny <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">idea</span> <a href="http://scoopertino.com/apple-introduces-ihand-the-right-way-to-hold-your-iphone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://scoopertino.com/apple-introduces-ihand-the-right-way-to-hold-your-iphone/', 'post']);" >post</a> about an accessory for Apple called the **iHand**. As holding the **iPhone 4** in your hand can cause the phone to lose connectivity Apple will roll out this accessory called the iHand which replicates a hand. ðŸ˜€

  <a rel="attachment wp-att-28214" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/apples-new-solution-for-iphone-4-is-the-ihand-funny/ihand_funny02/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28214" title="iHand_funny02" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/iHand_funny02.png" alt="" width="550" height="528" /></a><em>Image: <a href="http://scoopertino.com/apple-introduces-ihand-the-right-way-to-hold-your-iphone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://scoopertino.com/apple-introduces-ihand-the-right-way-to-hold-your-iphone/', 'Scoopertino']);" >Scoopertino</a></em>

The detail of this spoof is funnier with ideas like it will in various tones like iHand Caucasian, iHand Black, iHand Indian, iHand Asian. ðŸ˜›

Apparently the accessory will cost $69 and will help people to hold the iPhone 4 without any signal issues.
