Remember those days when your Grandmother read out those stories of how &#8216;HTML 5&#8242; won over the heart of &#8216;Browsers&#8217;, how &#8216;Privacy Issues&#8217; were the treasure chest which &#8216;Applications&#8217; stole away &#8211; AsÂ bizarre as this may sound, that day has come. Google&#8217;s most recent development isÂ <a href="http://www.20thingsilearned.com/home" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.20thingsilearned.com/home', '20 Things I Learned About The Browsers and the Web']);" target="_blank">20 Things I Learned About The Browsers and the Web</a> which is styled much like an children&#8217;s e-book.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32280" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-releases-an-e-book-about-the-web-world/20-things-i-learned-about-browsers-and-the-web/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32280" title="20 Things I Learned About Browsers and the Web" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/20-Things-I-Learned-About-Browsers-and-the-Web.png" alt="" width="338" height="307" /></a>

As the name suggests, it contains 19 observations about the web and one last chapter as a recap. The book is written by Min Li Chan, Fritz Holznagel and Michael Krantz. There are brilliant illustrations by Christoph Niemann. Once the site loads up, you can disconnect and read the full book.

Its design and wordings are bound to take you down memory lane. What I like the most is that they haven&#8217;t forgotten the childrens book theme they have chosen whilst writing the chapters &#8211; such as in the chapter about Web Applications, it&#8217;s mentioned &#8216;The four virtues of Web *Appiness*&#8230;&#8217;

### Why a book on the web?

I think Google probably took note of its video which implies a strong demand for some serious education regarding the dot-com world. Take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ', 'this video']);" >this video</a>. ðŸ˜€

Give the E-book a read and drop in your comments and views.
