“ *Please do not store passwords if you are accessing this web page from a public computer* ” . Grr ! How many times  have we gone through the misery of repeating our login id&#8217;s time & again. Whether that be your 5 minute break when you have to  lock your PC or having multiple email / networking ids, lets face it , we absolutely **HATE **the process of authentication !  Any solutions ? **Biometrics** ! Biometrics is a science of methods used to uniquely identify humans based on the features each one of us is made of ! Cool huh !

<a href="http://www.keylemon.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.keylemon.com/', 'KeyLemon']);" target="_blank">KeyLemon</a> , has created a facial recognition software  which will authenticate your session by scanning your face instead of you manually typing in the password ! Besides Keylemon , HP have also made their presence felt  in the Biometrics sector . Their face recognition software was recently in news for being unable to track features of dark people . HP refuted the allegations and claimed that it was a contrast issue .

However , the software that we are talking about today has proven to be extremely efficient in identifying faces irrespective of shades . To have a glimpse of how this software tracks your information and regulates access , check this video tutorial by clicking <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYDJetMyxS4" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYDJetMyxS4', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>.

KeyLemon allows you to set multiple accounts and it uses your web cam to check if the person using the computer is really you ! You can limit the number of times it scans your face from settings . In a era where security is of prime importance , we think this software is an ideal solution . You can use Keylemon to authenticate not just your windows login but Firefox users can download a plug in to access <a href="http://www.facebook.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com', 'Facebook']);" target="_blank">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkedin.com/', 'LinkedIn']);" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twitter.com', 'Twitter']);" target="_blank">Twitter</a> .

Currently you can download this software and use it for **30 logins** with face recognition as it is free to try , although the retail price of the full version is **$19.95** .

The Minimum hardware requirements  are :

  * Pentium 500 MHz (Recommended: Pentium 1GHz or greater)
  * 100 MB RAM (Recommended: 128 MB RAM or greater)
  * 25 MB hard drive space
  * USB webcam or integrated webcam (laptop)

To download the software kindly click <a href="http://www.keylemon.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.keylemon.com/', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a> .  Try this app and drop comments to let us know what you think about it !
