  * **Cleaner Facebook Wall** : Imagine an advertisement free Facebook wall. I usually get irritated by the zillions of advertisements overcrowding my homepage. So I was searching for ways to avoid it and I found <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-a-cleaner-wall/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-a-cleaner-wall/', 'this Greasemoneky script which gives you a cleaner Facebook wall']);" >this Greasemoneky script which gives you a cleaner Facebook wall</a>. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> A better experience all together.
  * **Auto colorizer**: I just wanted to change the way my homepage looks so I installed this<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-add-a-color-scheme-to-your-facebook-account/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-add-a-color-scheme-to-your-facebook-account/', ' Greasemonkey script which adds a color scheme to my Facebook account']);" > Greasemonkey script which adds a color scheme to my Facebook account</a> according to the profile picture you have uploaded.

  * **Highlight the Birthdays**: There are some of my friends who really have problem remembering the birthdays, even if the birthdays are now shown on the homepage of your Facebook account. This <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-highlight-birthdays-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-highlight-birthdays-on-facebook/', 'Greasemonkey script highlights the birthday reminders']);" >Greasemonkey script highlights the birthday reminders</a> on the right hand side of your homepage.

  * **Large images on Facebook**: I used to get really irritated when I had to strain my eyes to see a particular image on Facebook. So I Â tweaked a bit and found this <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-large-images-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-large-images-on-facebook/', 'Greasemonkey Script that enlarges the photographs and profile photos of the Facebbok users on mouse hover']);" >Greasemonkey Script that enlarges the photographs and profile photos of the Facebbok users on mouse hover</a>.

  * **Enhance the Facebook account**: Apart from one click logout, stretched homepage and keyboard shortcuts you can manage the sidebars, their visibility and customize the homepage as and when required. This <a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-enhance-your-facebook-account/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-enhance-your-facebook-account/', 'Greasemonkey script enhances your Facebook experience']);" >Greasemonkey script enhances your Facebook experience</a> making you tweak and change as and when required. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
