Today I was playing around on the Google search page and looking up interesting [Google suggestions which have always had its funny posts][1]. But Google suggest feature which automatically shows suggestions in a drop down in the search box are quite useful and probably makes its easier for people who do not use search engines a lot.

I came across some direct links with Google suggestions which was quite a first for me. Usually only keywords would appear but type in only &#8216;Gmail or &#8216;YouTube&#8217;, I came across a direct link. It was behaving quite a bit like a browser with access to history. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

As you can see in the image above there is a direct link to** Gmail** showing upÂ  first on the drop down images. I tried to see which website pull up with such direct links in Google suggestions and very popular websites all showed up with direct links to them in the suggestions.

This basically means there is no need for using the address bar of your browser while on Google if you are visiting a popular website like Facebook, Twitter or Gmail.

I had recently written about [Google Vs Bing][2] and fact is these are the innovations from Google which is why so many really use it even if Bing gives almost pretty similar results.

What do you think about direct links in a search box drop down? Do let me know through your comments.
