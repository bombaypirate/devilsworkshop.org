You all might have knew, the [Aviary Image Editor][1]. Aviary image editor is one of the best online editors around the web. Recently they have changed from paid one to a fully free online application. The same company has launched the new online music creator tool. Aviary&#8217;s music creator turns anyone into a musician with a few simple clicks.

Now anyone can create music and beats completely from scratch and right in their browser, by simulating almost 50 different instruments, ranging from common instruments like various drums, pianos and guitars to orchestral instruments like harps and flutes to more obscure (but fun!) instruments you may never have heard of like the balarimba and hammered dulcimer.

Aviary&#8217;s Music Creator is incredibly simple and yet is also full featured, allowing more advanced users to mix and match any instruments &#8211; and even record your voice or upload your own custom sounds.
