There are situations when you want to access a system remotely. If both the systems have Windows OS then it&#8217;s not a problem but what if one system has Windows & the other has LINUX/Mac. ðŸ˜›

**The solution is to use VNC server.**

**Virtual Network Computing** (**VNC**) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the RFB protocol to remotely control another computer. VNC is platform-independent.

**Linux**

Almost all Linux OS have inbuilt VNC server. For connecting Linux system to Windows you need to install VNC viewer which you can download from <span style="color: #000080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.realvnc.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.realvnc.com/', 'www.realvnc.com']);" target="_blank">www.realvnc.com</a></span></span> or <span style="color: #000080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tightvnc.com/', 'www.tightvnc.com']);" target="_blank">www.tightvnc.com</a></span></span>

**Windows**

  * You need to install VNC server from above mentioned sites on your system.
  * Steps to connect Windows viewer to Linux server
  * Start VNC server on linux system using command VNC Server
  * Click on Start and Run VNC viewer on Windows system.

  * Type the IP Address of the system to which you want to connect and then click OK.
  * Now you can access the remote (Linux) system.

The only problem which I came acrossÂ  is that when you completely maximize the screen it locksÂ  & you have to manually close session from remote system to gain the access again.
