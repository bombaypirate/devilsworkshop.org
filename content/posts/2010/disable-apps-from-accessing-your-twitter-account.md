Twitter recently announced that 3rd party applications will no longer be allowed to store your user-name and passwords. Even though applications will not save the password, it can still be used to access your Twitter account even if you change the password. This happens with the **OAuth** service which requires to sign in only once for a third-party app. This means potentially all the apps you have used for Twitter can access your account.

Twitter has settings which allows controlling which app is allowed to access your Twitter account details.

## How to revoke access for certain Apps?

  1. Just login into your **Twitter **account on the website. Then look up **Settings**.
  2. Under **Settings **there is a the **Connections **Tab.
  3. Clicking on Connections will show you a complete list of all the apps that can access Twitter. This is very useful as under new guidelines Apps will not need to have you sign in more than once to get access to your account.
  4. Simply look up the app you do not want to have access of your Twitter account and revoke its access. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I have tested many applications with my Twitter credentials. So revoking access to some apps is a great boon.
