Few days ago we shared a Fence Add-on for Firefox , which would be helpful for you to increase your productivity. Here is another Firefox Add-0n , to increase your [productivity][1] while writing articles. Whenever you think of writing a useful post for your readers, you do research about that topic so that you can provide correct and to the point information to your readers.

You usually need to research the topics from reliable websites. The maximum time you waste is to do research on using various [search engines][2]. Here I am sharing with you a very simple Add on for Firefox which will surely save your time to research about the topics you want to write.

### **Discover relevant topics**

It helps you to discover quality websites, related articles from blogs and news websites and you can also check out latest comments about the topic you are searching. Always remember comments help you to research in better way about any topic.

### **Different views**

You can view all the list of similar websites according to your comfort. You can choose to see thumbnails of websites, animated thumbnail view or browse through toolbar button. SimilarWeb also allows you to choose from List view or thumbnail view. Choose the one which you find easy and time saving.

<img style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 100px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/sidebar.png" border="0" alt="sidebar" width="130" height="373" /> [<img style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 100px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/Tabmode_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Tab mode" width="103" height="376" />][3] <img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 100px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/Buzz.png" border="0" alt="Buzz" width="130" height="384" />

### **Vote for websites**

This is really cool use of SimilarWeb . It allows you to vote for similar site, you can add you own website to SimilarWeb as well as you can share with your friends. You can vote up or down for any website.

<img style="float: none;margin: 10px auto;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/toolbar.png" border="0" alt="toolbar" width="528" height="303" />

Do download SimilarWeb and use it and let me know your view. I think <a href="http://www.similarweb.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.similarweb.com/', 'SimilarWeb']);" >SimilarWeb</a> is helpful for all the bloggers to increase their productivity.

Do share with us, which Firefox Add-on you use to increase your productivity?
