When Gmail was first introduced it was quite a novel experience. I remember in those days Hotmail and Yahoo email interfaces were rigid and dull when compared to the Gmail which was by invitation only and still a beta product. I started using Gmail for backing up my old email and ended up using Gmail as my primary account. One of the key features I loved in Gmail was labels. It was a fantastic innovation and Gmail and now taken it a little further but introducing **nested labels** along with **sneak peeks**.

### **About Nested Labels**

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a rel="attachment wp-att-23275" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-introduces-nested-labels-and-sneak-peeks/nested_labels1/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23275" style="border: 1px solid teal;" title="nested_labels1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/nested_labels1.png" alt="" width="309" height="265" /></a>
</p>

  * You can activate the beta feature of Gmail by clicking on **Settings** and then **Labs**. Under labs I needed to look up **Nested Labels** as seen in image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-23278" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-introduces-nested-labels-and-sneak-peeks/nested_labels2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23278" title="nested_labels2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/nested_labels2.png" alt="" width="550" height="78" /></a>

  * Now once the feature is working you need to make some changes to reorganize your Labels like seen above.
  * You will have to rename the labels. As you can see in the image right above I have **My Labels** and under it **Twitter** Label and under it resides **<a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/join-retweet-club-for-bloggers.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shoutmeloud.com/join-retweet-club-for-bloggers.html', 'SML ReTweet Club']);" >SML ReTweet Club</a>** Label. Here I renamed ***Twitter*** as **My Labels/Twitter** and ***SMLRTclub*** as **My Labels/Twitter/SMLRTclub** and that created the nested label effect as seen in the image.

### **About Sneak Peek**

**<a rel="attachment wp-att-23283" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-introduces-nested-labels-and-sneak-peeks/sneak_peek_gmail/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23283" title="sneak_peek_gmail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/sneak_peek_gmail.png" alt="" width="550" height="258" /></a>  
**

  * To enable **Sneak Peek** just go under **Settings** and then **Labs**. Within **Labs** I needed to **enable Sneak Peek** feature in **Gmail**.
  * This allowed me to get a peek at the email by just **right clicking** while looking at it in the Inbox. This is very useful as I do not have to open the mail and get the gist of its importance with a simple right click. I like previewing email and that was a reason I had written about [Gmail in tablet interface with Chrome][1] as it gives you a preview very easily so you can skip to the next one.

Do try out these new features introduced by Gmail and let me know your opinions on it. Also do drop in through your comments what other Labs features you use with Gmail. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
