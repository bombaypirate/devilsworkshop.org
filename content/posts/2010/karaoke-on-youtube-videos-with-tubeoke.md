I do not always download a song or buy CDs. Sometimes thanks to a decent connection many songs are already up on You Tube to listen to. So sometimes I would open a website which looks up lyrics of a song and then play the song on You Tube to sing along. I guess that is a way to Karaoke with You Tube. One way is to look up [You Tube Captions][1] but that is not usually always available especially with music videos.

Now with **Tubeoke** there is not need for searching for a song on **YouTube** and <a href="http://lyrics.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lyrics.com', 'lyrics.com']);" ><strong>lyrics.com</strong></a> simultaneously. <a href="http://tubeoke.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tubeoke.com', 'TubeOke']);" >TubeOke</a> does it both for you.

### **About <a href="http://tubeoke.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tubeoke.com', 'Tubeoke']);" >Tubeoke</a>**

  * Just enter the name of the song you want to watch with You tube and search it with **Tubeoke**.
  * You will get some options and selecting one will allow you to view lyrics on the right and the song playing on the left of the screen.
  * Now you can view the song on YouTube and also sing along with the lyrics. I have tried it with quiet a few songs and did not find any song that could not be found.

If you have the song as a file on your computer then you might want to look up [lyrics plugin for Windows Media Player and Winamp][2]. Do give **Tubeoke** a try and drop in your comments to let me know if you liked it?

Also let us know of any other service or plugin which is useful for playing songs and singing along. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
