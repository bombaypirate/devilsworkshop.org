A great way to get an idea about how well a internet company is doing would be to read tech blogs. The more the number of times a company and its services are reviewed and mentioned, you can be assured that the company is building and maintaining a momentum. This is where Yahoo lags behind against almost every big internet brand.

I came across <a href="http://pulse.yahoo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pulse.yahoo.com/', 'Yahoo Pulse']);" >Yahoo Pulse</a> and was told that it would rival [Google Buzz][1]. So I decided to check it out and mid-way realized that this might be another mistake by Yahoo.

### **What is <a href="http://pulse.yahoo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pulse.yahoo.com', 'Yahoo Pulse']);" >Yahoo Pulse</a>?**

If you are familiar to Google Buzz which almost everyone is thanks to them embedding it on Gmail, you will find Yahoo Pulse pretty similar to Buzz. Pulse does have better features when it comes to privacy as atleast at this moment I do not see it in your Yahoo Inbox by default.

So basically Yahoo Pulse allows you to share photos, messages, videos and even sync your Facebook wall messages with your Yahoo contacts without the need for leaving the Yahoo environment. Great! But the worrying part is how many still want to remain in the Yahoo environment?

### **Why Yahoo Pulse can rock.**

Yahoo Pulse plans to allow users to tap into Facebook. To the extent that we might be able to play Mafia Wars and Farmville along with use all features of Facebook through Yahoo Pulse. This further being integrated with Yahoo Mail might mean a user would not need to visit another website at all and use Yahoo for all purposes.

This is great news for loyal Yahoo users and might improve some numbers.

### **Why Yahoo Pulse will not rock.**

I remember using [Yahoo Meme][2] a couple of times. It was supposed to [rival Twitter][3] and to be honest it has better features than Twitter does. But Twitter had cornered the market when it came to micro-blogging. Yahoo Pulse will meet a similar fate to **Yahoo Meme** as it is not offering something newer for users but just something better.

Also Yahoo concentrating on allowing its users get more **Facebook** updates seems to be a short term view. Yahoo cannot allow users to use **Facebook** on one side from its own environment and still compete with Facebook. It is like a Twitter application competing with Twitter!

It just will not succeed as Yahoo is building a growth strategy which is dependent on Facebook&#8217;s success.

So are you using Yahoo Pulse? Do you think **Yahoo Pulse** could save **Yahoo** the company or will it turn out to be another famous mistake by Yahoo? Do drop in your comments.
