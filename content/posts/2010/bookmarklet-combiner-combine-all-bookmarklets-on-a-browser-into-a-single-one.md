Bookmarklets are often used by people like me who share things on social networks or bookmark a website on Delicious or for that matter even for subscribing to its RSS feed.

I recently came across Bookmarklet Combiner which allowed me to combine all my bookmarklets into one single bookmarklet on the browser.

## What is a bookmarklet?

Bookmarklet is basically a JavaScript code which is saved as a bookmark on the browser. When you click on the bookmarklet it runs as script. It is often used to share a link on social networks or even to subscribe to a websites RSS feed.

  * Visit the Bookmarklet Combiner web page.
  * Drop in the link of all the bookmarks you want to combine and rename them separately. Something like in the image above.
  * I could select how the bookmarklets are combined. Either you can see them in a drop down menu or to run all combined bookmarklets. I personally found having the bookmarklets show in a drop down menu.

Once done I could share the bookmarklet link with others too. Usually in most cases I prefer to drag and drop a bookmarklet on my browser instead of installing add-ons or extensions. The main advantage is they basically work the same way on all browsers.

Do drop in your comments and let me know if you use Bookmarklets often?
