As a blogger I end up entering my email address far more often than I ever planned to. I have a email address specifically meant for such cases as in case these websites are explored by spam bots. The last thing you want is spam mail to make its way in its hundreds into your **Inbox**. There are many ways of inserting email address on to the internet so that it does not come back to haunt you thanks to spam.

One very very popular method is to replace @ with [at]. So it ends up showing my email id as *aditya.kane**[at]**rtcamp.com*. Another method is also to use **[dot]**.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19220" title="email_id_image" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/email_id_image.png" alt="email_id_image" width="194" height="71" />

### About <a href="http://img4me.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://img4me.com/', 'Image 4 me']);" >Image 4 me</a>

  * <a href="http://img4me.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://img4me.com/', 'Image 4 me']);" >Image 4 me</a> is a internet service which allows you to write out your email id and create an image.
  * It also stores this image allowing you to insert in within the web-page with either HTML code. This is quiet handy as image is not hosted on the website.
  * Before creating the image of the email id you have the option to customize it&#8217;s look regarding background and also even font. This can give you the option of uniformity with the website layout or design while displaying your email id.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19221" style="border: 1px solid black" title="email_id_image2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/email_id_image2.png" alt="email_id_image2" width="500" height="338" />

  * Here is an example of my email id being displayed here as an image.

So now you can email me and I do not need to worry about spam bots making a nuisance of themselves to my **Inbox**. Let me know if you find this tool useful. Do drop in your comments.
