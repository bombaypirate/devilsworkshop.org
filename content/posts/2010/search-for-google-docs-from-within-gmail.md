excerpt: mail recently brought out a feature which lets you search for Google Docs from within Gmail. This is a great feature as sometimes it is a bit boring to open Google docs landing page and then search for the document you need. This way I can search for it and open it from within Gmail.

Gmail recently brought out a feature which lets you <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-in-labs-find-docs-and-sites-quickly.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-in-labs-find-docs-and-sites-quickly.html', 'search for Google Docs from within Gmail']);" >search for Google Docs from within Gmail</a>. This is a great feature as sometimes it is a bit boring to open Google docs landing page and then search for the document you need. This way I can search for it and open it from within Gmail.

### How to use Gmail Search Mail and Docs?

  * Need to enable a labs feature by looking up **Settings **>> **Labs**. Here enable **Apps Search **feature and save the settings.
  * Now on search in mail chances to search with Mail and Docs. As you can see in the image below I could choose to only display Docs results if too many results showed up. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  * When adding a new Labs feature one problem is slowing down Gmail but since I have started using this feature I have not noticed any slowdown when it came to searching for mails and docs alike.

### What is missing from this feature?

Recently Gmail introduced a [official multiple sign-in of Gmail accounts][1]. I think this **Mail and Docs search feature** would be awesome if we could search from 2-3 different accounts using just one account. Now that feature would knock em dead! ðŸ˜€

Try out **Search Mail and Docs feature** with **Gmail **and do let me know your views through your comments.
