It is Sunday and at DW we sometimes publish some unique and interesting content which does fit the usual tutorials, news or &#8216;How to&#8217; genre. So I thought I will share this interesting snapshot of 30 years of evolution of how data is stored. Ever wondered what data storage was like about 30 years ago? Recently I came across this great image which I am sharing below showing how data storage has changed so radically in the last 30 years.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-22518" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/evolution-of-data-storage-technology-past-and-present/data_storage_30_years/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22518" title="data_storage_30_years" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/data_storage_30_years.png" alt="" width="550" height="299" /></a>

  * On the left are Eight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_IBM_disk_storage#IBM_3380" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_IBM_disk_storage#IBM_3380', '2.5 GB IBM 3380 Disk Systems']);" >2.5 GB IBM 3380 Disk Systems</a> approx 20GB memory with an estimated value of over 1 Million USD and weighing about 2000 Kilograms. The data transfer rate in these systems was about 3 mega bytes per second.
  * On the right in present day, one MicroSD Card can store 32 GB memory alone with a value of just over $100 USD with a weight of 0.5 grams. The size of this card is about the size of the red button IBM Disk Systems would have to start it up. ðŸ˜›

Do share through your comments on how fast technology has been evolving and your own experiences with the same.
