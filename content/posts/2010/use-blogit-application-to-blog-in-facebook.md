If you are a Facebook Addict , you would love to blog from Facebook itself, there is a simple application “BlogIt” using which you can Blog from Facebook itself. It is easy and fun to use. The only problem with BlogIT is you can’t do lots of formatting in the post.But than also I would suggest this tool because it is very useful when you have to share some important or current news in your blog , you can easily do with your Facebook account while travelling , roaming and no need to open your WordPress account.
