  * IPTools has a large suite of IP related tools. Some of the most obvious ones are it looks up your IP and displays it.
  * The other obvious tools included are looking up **Ping**, **IP to Country**, **trace route** and **whois look-up**.
  * There are other neat tools which allowed me to to email address and check if the domain offers free internet. Very useful if you see an email id with a interesting domain and want to check if the domain allows free email service.
