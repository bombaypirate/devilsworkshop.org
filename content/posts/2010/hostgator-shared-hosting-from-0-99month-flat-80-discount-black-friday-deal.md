3 days back we posted about upcoming [Black Friday and Cyber Monday events and how they bring opportunity to make/save money][1]!

As expected, we are loaded with plenty of deals here. This post is about most lucrative webhosting deal from <a href="http://rt.cx/hostgator" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.cx/hostgator', 'HostGator']);" >HostGator</a> where you can get decent quality web-hosting starting from $0.99/month. For the first-time HostGator is offering flat 80% discount on all their hosting products which includes VPS as well as dedicated hosting.

## HostGator Rate-Card for Black Friday

<a href="http://rt.cx/hostgator" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.cx/hostgator', '']);" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32759" title="HostGator Black Friday Rate Card" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/HostGator-Black-Friday-Rate-Card.png" alt="" width="599" height="330" /></a>

As you can see, there are two flat-rate discounts available on Black Friday.

80% discount will be available for 4-hours only between 5AM to 9AM CST. From 12AM to 5AM and 9AM to 11:59PM, flat 50% discount will be available.

### Clocking CST timezone!

If you are already in CST timezone, then only big deal for you is to wakeup early, i.e. 5AM to get maximum 80% discount. **80% discount may end-up earlier than 9AM**, if HostGator gets more sales than anticipated.

For other bloggers from around the world, below are 2 helpful links:

Using first link, I found in India, it will be 04:30 PM when 80% discount will take off.
