FarmVille Collections is a new feature of FarmVille in which you can collect things like Gardening tool, bugs e.t.c. To collect these you have to play FarmVille and perform it&#8217;s various tasks that you usually do like Plowing, Harvesting, Fertilizing and Gifting items to your friends. These Collections can be found in your giftbox and to see your own collection click on the &#8216;Ribbons&#8217; near your giftbox icon and select collections. However the purpose of these Collections is still not clear as there&#8217;s no official update from FarmVille blog.

Few points about New FarmVille Collections:

  * There are four types of collection:

Gardening Tools Collection
