Recently **Facebook** has <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-smaller-fonts/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-smaller-fonts/', 'changed the size of fonts']);" >changed the size of fonts</a>. The change is good as it lets more feeds appear on your page. But many people didn&#8217;t like the change as these new fonts have become too small to see. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I have searched a Greasemonkey script that brings back old Facebook fonts back to your account.

Check out the images below.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-back-old-facebook-fonts/old/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-back-old-facebook-fonts/old/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3525"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-53516" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/old.png" alt="" width="414" height="53" /></a>

As you can see in the image above, the fonts were quite small.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-back-old-facebook-fonts/new/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-get-back-old-facebook-fonts/new/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3526"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3526" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/new.png" alt="" width="447" height="55" /></a>

In the image above you can see how the new font size looks after applying this script.

## How to install?

### Firefox:

  * If using **Firefox** you should have Greasemonkey installed.
  * Go <a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89552" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89552', 'here']);" >here</a>.
  * Install the script.
  * Restart your browser.

### Chrome:

  * For **Chrome** users you just need to install <a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89552" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89552', 'this script']);" >this script</a> and refresh.

After using these scripts your Facebook will look just as it used to look before. In case you are okay with the new fonts and just have problem reading some things then you can use &#8216;Ctrl +&#8217; to zoom in a little bit. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
