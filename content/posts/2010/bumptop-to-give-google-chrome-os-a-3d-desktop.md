**Bumptop** is a software which allows Windows and Mac users to create realistic 3D environments on their desktops for handling files and folders. Desktop has not really changed much for most operation systems. Most of them still serve as a stationary jump off point for folders and files. **BumpTop** allowed users to use the 3D desktop in interesting ways.

Below is a snapshot of a typical desktop using **BumpTop.**

Bumptop is not letting people download the software which converts the desktop into a 3d environment. Also it announces as it has been bought by Google it will not be supporting Mac and Windows any more. ðŸ˜›

This pretty much points to Bumptop being used to give Chromium OS a killer desktop. Google probably might use this sort of software as a great interface for tablets which use Chrome OS. The first official release of the [Chromium OS][1] is supposed to be later in the year but there is not real clarity on it.

**Bumptop** had showed its awesome 3D desktop which could be used with a touch screen. See the video below.  


So what do you think Google with do with BumpTop? Will if create the ultimate 3D desktop environment? Do let us know through your comments.
