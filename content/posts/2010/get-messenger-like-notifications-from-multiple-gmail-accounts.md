Gmail has now a days become the first choice email for many and very often we have more than 2 or 3 Gmail accounts. For instance you might have separate **Gmail** accounts for your blog, personal mail and work related email. As you might know that [we at ][1]**[rtCamp][1]**[ use Google apps][1] and I have a personal Gmail account. So monitoring multiple account makes sense for me.  
I wrote a few days ago about using [Greasemonkey scripts to use multiple Gmail accounts from the same page][2].

Now I wanted to share with you Gmail Manager 0.6 which is a Firefox add-on. In the case you have some concerns having Greasemonkey scripts running on your browser from a security angle; Gmail manager makes a lot of sense.

### About <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1320" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1320', 'Gmail Manager']);" >Gmail Manager</a>

  * Gmail Manager add-on can be downloaded by clicking here. Once the add-on is downloaded restart Firefox browser.
  * The add-on options allows your enter your Gmail ID and Password. This will give you notification for any acocunt when you get an email.
  * Just clicking on the relevant account will take you directly to your Inbox.
  * If you hover your mouse pointer over the Account tag; you will get a pop-up which shows your emails that are in your inbox. Unfortunately you cannot go directly to the email from the pop-up. I guess that is what can be considered room for improvement.

If you are using Firefox browser and have a lot of active Gmail accounts <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1320" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1320', 'Gmail Manager add-on']);" >Gmail Manager add-on</a> is something which should interest you.
