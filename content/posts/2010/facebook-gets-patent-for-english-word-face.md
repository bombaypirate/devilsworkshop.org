Do you remember, <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-wants-to-own-the-english-word-face/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-wants-to-own-the-english-word-face/', 'once we spoke about Facebook getting a patent for its name Face']);" >once we spoke about Facebook getting a patent for its name Face</a>. Just some time ago Facebook filed a request for patent against the word &#8216;Face&#8217; on seeing a company being operated with a name Faceparty.com. Well, now the news is that Facebook is actually getting the patent.

That is government will give the site trademark under certain conditions. If you are going to name your social networking site as Facefriends or something starting or ending with face you are into a trouble.

The company has now to file a statement of use within 6 months. An attorney will have  a look at it and then decide whether it should be given or not. If this is approved then trademark office will issue a registration within two months. I wonder what kind of request will Google file for patent? Will it  ask for a trademark book, so that Facebook gets stuck with its word Face? Not sure, lets see what happens. I still dont think they should be given the trademark for english normal words like Face and Book. Do they think there will not be any beauty website with the word Face in its name? What do you think? Feel free to share your views through the comments below.
