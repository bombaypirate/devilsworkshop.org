Sometimes you just like a pdf file of something you read on the internet. This is really needed when you read a tutorial or a online manual. One thing you want, would be a PDF document to read or even store. I reviewed Flexamail recently which allows you to from your email create a pdf document of a web page and fetch it as a PDF document. That service can only be used for a PDF document of 15MB as it has to be email friendly.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19965" title="pdfmyurl" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/pdfmyurl.png" alt="pdfmyurl" width="400" height="202" />

One of the main features of this is it allows any page to be converted into PDF. I checked with creating PDF of large size and it does work quite well so I guess size of the PDF to be generated will not be a issue.

I think the most exciting part of this service is that you can add this into your website or blog with a simple code being inserted in the web-page. I tried to see if there is a widget which can put up this code to create the PDF of the page automatically; but I did not come across any. I guess at the moment if you want visitors to download your webpage you have to manually enter this HTML code.

> `<a  href="http://pdfmyurl.com?url=www.opentracker.net">downlaod this page  as pdf</a>`

You can even directly link an customized image to

> `http://pdfmyurl.com?url=www.opentracker.net `

This will allow a visitor to click on the image or link on your page and the page is converted to PDF. ðŸ˜‰

For people addicted to PDF there is also a bookmarket which is offered by the website and all you need to do is drag the **bookmarklet** to your bookmarks in the browser and when you are at a page you want to convert to **PDF** just click on the **bookmarklet**.

Do check out <a href="http://pdfmyurl.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pdfmyurl.com/', 'PDF my URL']);" >PDF my URL</a> and try it out. Do drop in your comments on what you think about this service.
