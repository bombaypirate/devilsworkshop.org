Almost everyone using a **Facebook** chat loves to use <a href="http://fbknol.com/list-of-facebook-chat-emoticons-to-spice-up-the-chat/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/list-of-facebook-chat-emoticons-to-spice-up-the-chat/', 'emoticons']);" ><strong>emoticons</strong></a>. The only trouble with them is how many can you remember? Well so here is a quick way to use them without remembering them. You can download an **add-on** on **Firefox** and start using them instantly.

## How to install it?

  * Go <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14013/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14013/', 'here']);" >here</a>.
  * Click on add to Firefox.
  * Restart your browser.

This add-on gives you a set of emoticons at the top of all of your chat windows.Â You can use them just by clicking. Phew what a relief from remembering those things. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Do you know of any other such script that does the same or better than this? Do share it with me through the comments below.
