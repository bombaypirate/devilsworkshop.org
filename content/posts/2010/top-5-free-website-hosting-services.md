When you start blogging we often do not require to buy space or have our own domain on the internet. This is mainly because some people blog just for fun and are not serious about making it a profession or even make money out of it. Ofcourse there are options like <a href="http://blogspot.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogspot.com', 'blogspot.com']);" ><strong>blogspot.com</strong></a> and **<a href="http://wordpress.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.com', 'wordpress.com']);" >wordpress.com</a>** but there are quite a few free website hosting services. I think these websites would be quite useful for designers and programmers to test their products. ðŸ˜‰

So here is a list of 5 free website hosting services I feel might be worth looking at.

### **#1. <a href="http://www.jimdo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jimdo.com', 'Jimdo']);" >Jimdo</a>**

Jimdo is a free service which is ideal for people who are looking to sell things online.

  * Jimdo allows with free account storage space upto 500 MB.
  * It also supports Photo galleries, widgets and also a store for selling things from your website.
  * One good point about this hosting service when compared to other free services is that it allows adding Flash on it.

### **#2. <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.000webhost.com/', '000webhost']);" >000webhost</a>**

000Webhost is the probably one of the best free hosting options you might come across.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-28242" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-free-website-hosting-services/5_free_website_hosting_000webhost/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28242" title="5_free_website_hosting_000webhost" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/5_free_website_hosting_000webhost.png" alt="" width="550" height="322" /></a>

### **#3. **<a href="http://www.110mb.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.110mb.com/', '110mb']);" >110mb</a>

110mb as its URl suggest allows free hosting upto 110 MB.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-28243" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-free-website-hosting-services/5_free_website_hosting_110mb/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28243" title="5_free_website_hosting_110mb" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/5_free_website_hosting_110mb.png" alt="" width="500" height="262" /></a>

  * 110mb.com allows data exchange of upto 100 GB along with the 110 MB storage space.
  * It does not allow WordPress, Drupal or MySQL databases.
  * It is one of the few free services allowing unique domains!

### **#4. <a href="http://www.freewebsites.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freewebsites.com/', 'Freewebsites']);" >Freewebsites</a>**

Freewebsites is another free hosting service which allows having your unique domains.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-28246" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-free-website-hosting-services/5_free_website_hosting_freewebsites/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28246" title="5_free_website_hosting_freewebsites" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/5_free_website_hosting_freewebsites.png" alt="" width="550" height="192" /></a>

  * Freewebsites allows unlimited free web space but has restrictions on file size to upto 5 MB.
  * It also is hosted and supported on Unix servers.
  * The catch is they do not register the domain name but allow hosting. So you might have to buy the domain name from elsewhere and then use Freewebsites hosting features.

### **#5. <a href="http://www.webs.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.webs.com/', 'Webs']);" >Webs</a>**

Webs is meant for very limited users but is a free hosting service.
