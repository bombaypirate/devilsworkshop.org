As the end of 2010 approaches, analysis is being made everywhere about what was on top and what was not. A recent study made by Hitwise shows that Facebook was the most visited site of the year 2010.

It is no big surprise for us as we all were hoping this is going to happen. With all the success on its side this adds to the best one. What do you think? Feel free to share your views on this.
