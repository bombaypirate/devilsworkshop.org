title: Sync Firefox addons across multiple PCs

excerpt: |
  Shuttling between work and home can be like juggling through different time zones!! Though I use the same browser, which is Firefox- both seem like they are in two different worlds because my add-ons are completely different. I get used to one and have a problem with the other. I guess this was the same problem the developers of Siphon faced when they decided to come up with a Firefox add-on sychronizer.
  
  Siphon syncs your Firefox add-ons across different computers. Apart from add-ons, it also manages your saved passwords across these computers.

**<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11778/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11778/', 'Siphon']);" target="_blank">Siphon</a>** syncs your Firefox add-ons across different computers. Apart from add-ons, it also manages your saved passwords across these computers.

## Using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11778/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11778/', 'Siphon']);" target="_blank">Siphon</a>:

  * Download Siphon from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11778/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11778/', 'here']);" target="_blank">here</a>.
  * You will be asked to create an account, following which it will load your Firefox add-ons.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32585" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/sync-firefox-addons-across-multiple-pcs/siphon_account_create/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32585" title="Siphon_account_create" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Siphon_account_create.png" alt="" width="500" height="441" /></a>

  * Login with your new account, and Siphon should load all your Firefox add-ons. Install it to the other computers on which you use Firefox. Click &#8216;Synchronize&#8217;.
  * I could choose to have certain add-on not be synchronized.
  * My passwords could be saved across multiple Firefox browsers that I use. It is better to not save passwords when you are using a public computer.

Siphon, created by Ian Halpern, is a useful add-on. Its more like an *add-on for add-ons*. It&#8217;s still in the beta phase so we can expect improvements such as switching between user profiles, syncing themes, etc.
