### Missing Feature:

The new Facebook app for Androids covers a lot of new features which was earlier missing but still it&#8217;s not having a very important feature which is **Facebook chat. **Yes even the Android 1.3 isn&#8217;t supporting Facebook chat and you have to download another application for it.

**Bugs/Problems:**

Android users who are using Facebook 1.3 reported few bugs/problems with this app i.e:

  1. The video feature isn&#8217;t working properly**.**
  2. User Interface isn&#8217;t good.
  3. Notification is opening in browser rather than in application itself.
  4. Slow operation.

Due to these problems some users have installed the previous version i.e Facebook 1.2 again. Tell us what do you think about this new Facebook&#8217;s application for Android phones.
