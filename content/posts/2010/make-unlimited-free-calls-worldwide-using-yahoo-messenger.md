**Update**: Currently the service for free calls has been removed so the information in this post might not be entirely accurate. You might want to check this post on how to make [free calls from your computer to any mobile phone][1].

Everyone must have heard of free calls between computers using softwares like <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://messenger.yahoo.com', 'Yahoo! Messenger']);" >Yahoo! Messenger</a>, <a href="http://skype.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://skype.com', 'Skype']);" >Skype</a> and <a href="http://google.com/talk" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com/talk', 'Google Talk']);" >Google Talk</a>. Now-a-days calls from mobile-to-computer using GPRS is also common using mobile applications like <a href="http://fring.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fring.com', 'Fring']);" >Fring</a>, <a href="http://nimbuzz.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nimbuzz.com', 'Nimbuzz']);" >Nimbuzz</a>, etc. This is a simple trick to make calls from computer to almost any mobile or landline phone to many countries. All you need is Yahoo! Messenger or Skype or any other calling application which allows paid calling, internet connection with fair speed, speakers and microphone.Â  <img class="size-full wp-image-18583 aligncenter" title="1_1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/01/1_1.jpg" alt="1_1" width="214" height="246" />

### How to make the free call?

The free call is provided by <a href="http://free411.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://free411.com', 'Free411']);" >Free411</a>. I will guide you through Yahoo! Messenger.

  1. <div>
      Enter the number <strong>1800-FREE-411</strong> (1800-3733-411) where you enter the call number and make the call. This is a toll-free number.
    </div>

  2. <div>
      Wait for the call to connect. Once it connects, follow the voice instructions to reach the &#8216;Main Menu&#8217;. Say <strong>&#8220;Free Call&#8221;</strong> once Main Menu reaches.
    </div>

  3. <div>
      Once the system says &#8216;Dial the number&#8217;, dial the number using the dialpad in the international format.
    </div>

**Example**, to make call to India, dial 91 followed by a landline or 10 digit mobile number like 919876543210.

That&#8217;s it! Your call will be connected&#8230; The call limitation is 5 minutes. But you can call again countless number of times!! Sometimes a 20 sec long ad will be played when the call gets connected. Just listen to what the IVR (Interactive Voice Recording) says and follow the instructions.

At times, the system remains busy.In such case, call again, and it will work <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The procedure is same for Skype too.  
This is tested and works in India. Try for different countries and enjoy free callingâ€¦ ðŸ˜€
