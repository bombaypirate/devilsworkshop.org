Saving pics from websites and popular social networking sites is one of the most trending topics ofÂ  internet. Because to avoid misuse of their pics, website developers have started using new techniques so that no one can download their images. Frankly speaking, no one here is meant only for normal Internet users, not for techie geeks like us. ðŸ˜‰ Check out some ways by which you can save any pic from any website on the net. All you need to do is follow step by step procedure given below and any one is definitely gonna work for you. These steps have been sorted from easiest way of saving a pic to that when no other option works.

### 1.The Save Image as&#8230; option:

This option is most commonly used when you are allowed to save the image from the website and there&#8217;s no such security level. All you need to do is right click on any image and click &#8216;Save image as&#8230;&#8217; and save it wherever you want. Facebook can be considered as an example where you can easily save images from any album.

### 2. Drag and Drop:

If right clicking isn&#8217;t giving any response that means right click is disabled on that website. In such a case click the image you want to save and move the mouse cursor to address bar of your browser without leaving the click. This is commonly known as drag and drop. Orkut album pics(older version) can be saved by this method.

### 3. View Background image:

Some images in a website are stored as a &#8216;Background Image&#8217;. That means you can right click on them but there&#8217;s no option of saving it. But if you are using Firefox, it&#8217;s damn easy to save images like this. Right click on any image and click on &#8216;View Background Image&#8217; . Now your browser will show only the background image as a normal pic. Right click on the image and click &#8216;save image as&#8230;&#8217;.

Using this way you can save twitter backgrounds and other images of a website such as header, footer image e.t.c.

### 4.View Page Source:

Page source of a webpage is the same page but in html coding form, and even a single thing on a webpage can be seen in html using page source. To view page source click Ctrl+U from your firefox browser. Now if a website neither allows you to right click on it nor you can drag and drop images, probably this option will help you. Open the page where the image is located and view it&#8217;s page source. For firefox to view page source either press Ctrl+U or go to View>>View Page Source. Now in the page source search for ***.jpg ***which is a most commonly used extension for images. You can also search for ***.gif*** or ***.png ***. Now copy the link of image with which ***.jpg ***is attached. For example,

<a href="http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/gadgets/google-phone/Google-phone-/photo/5415500/Google-phone-.jpg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/gadgets/google-phone/Google-phone-/photo/5415500/Google-phone-.jpg', 'http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/gadgets/google-phone/Google-phone-/photo/5415500/Google-phone-.jpg']);" target="_blank">http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/gadgets/google-phone/Google-phone-/photo/5415500/Google-phone-.jpg</a>

<p style="text-align: center">
  <figure id="attachment_21363" style="width: 548px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/d_silhouette-Copy.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-21363 " title="Click to Enlarge" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/d_silhouette-Copy-600x337.gif" alt="" width="548" height="308" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Page Source</figcaption></figure> 
  
  <pre><code class="no-highlight">&lt;a href="http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5415500.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5415500.cms', '\n']);" target="_blank">
&lt;/a></code></pre>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5415500.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5415500.cms', 'Taken from this page ']);" target="_blank">Taken from this page </a>(indiatimes). Try saving image of google phone from <a href="http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5415500.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5415500.cms', 'the same page']);" target="_blank">the same page</a>.You&#8217;ll see that first three steps aren&#8217;t working in this case. So view the page source and find link of google phone with .jpg link. The page source is generally full of links with .jpg extension, use your common sense in selecting link in that case i.e check the other words given in that link such as &#8216;google phone&#8217; in above link. This method can be used for sites like photogallery.indiatimes.com but do not misuse the images with copyrights.

    Print screen option always works and you can save any image that you can see on your screen doesn&#8217;t matter how protected they are. To use print screen option, open any image on your computer and hit &#8216;Print Screen&#8217;Â  / &#8216;Prtsc&#8217; button on your keyboard. Now go to your desktop, right click on it and create a new bitmap image. Edit bitmap image using MS paint and press Ctrl+V (shortcut for paste). Crop the image if needed. Use this method for any website. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
