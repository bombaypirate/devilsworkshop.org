We have heard a lot about twitter related [scam][1], specially when an interesting [twitter application][2] comes into existence and after some time it misuses your account credential. At this moment third party [twitter application][3] can provide with two type of authentication :

  * Username Password
  * OAuth

In both of them I find OAuth authentication to be more secure because this way you can easily remove access of any third party twitter tool to your twitter account from your [twitter profile][4] setting page.

In official announcement twitter added

> Developers will have to switch over to OAuth by that time. between now and then, there will be a \*lot\* of information coming along with tips on how to use OAuth Echo, OAuth, etc. we really want to make this transition as easy as we can for everybody.

They will be removing the basic authentication method that is : username and password authentication.

Twitter also added a new website which is showing  <a href="http://www.countdowntooauth.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.countdowntooauth.com/', 'Countdown-To-OAuth']);" target="_blank">Countdown-To-OAuth</a>.

Personally I will enjoy this only one way of authenticating third part tool so that I can revoke their access any time and this will provide more [security][6]to my[ twitter accoun][7]t. Though this may be a bad news for developers as they might have to switch their authentication system.

*Do let us know your view about this changes from twitter. Do you think, this change is going to increase the security of your twitter account?*
