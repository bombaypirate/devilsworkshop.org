<a rel="attachment wp-att-33854" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-the-idea-of-blogging-is-similar-to-the-movie-inception-tdis/inception_blogging/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-33854" title="Inception_blogging" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/Inception_blogging.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>A couple of days ago there was a discussion in our blogging team about SEO, Social Media and many other ideas on blogging. These discussions and free exchange of ideas makes me really enjoy work.

While on my way from work to home I kept thinking about blogging in different ways. Questions like what is the relationship between a blogger and his readers? Â What are readers after all? When I blog, I often try to think of myself as the reader. This means I avoid writing anything that I wonâ€™t like to read.

One of the most cerebral movies this year has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception_(film)" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception_(film)', 'Inception']);" >Inception</a>. The concept of dream within a dream. The idea of a totem which tells you if you are dreaming or if what is happening around is real. I have been really fascinated with some of these ideas and decided that todayâ€™s [Thank Devil Itâ€™s Sunday][1] section will be about how the concepts of Inception can be compared to the concepts of blogging.

## Level One â€“ A blog is a dream

Your blog is your dream. But it is not enough to dream alone. Dreams need to be shared. A visitor to your blog is basically a participant in your dream. Your content is mainly how you will engage the reader in this dream. If the visitor does not like your post or blog much he will not return. Yup, the dream collapses and it is back to the drawing board.

When your reader likes your blog and wants to be part of your blog, he will write guest articles. When other bloggers write on your blog it is something like a dream within a dream. Yes, the guest author now has a dream within your dream. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Level Two â€“ The Guest Authorâ€™s dream

So now we have a dream within a dream, the ideas start to flow. Your absolute control over the content is compromised but your blogâ€™s community and influence increases. The increase in influence means just like you have a following, certain authors will have their own following.

## Level Three â€“ The extended community

These people are not necessarily interested in your blog as such but more interested in following a particular guest author. Think of these individual authorâ€™s community as his sub-conscious. Now that community dreams within the guest authors dream.

## The Totem â€“ Google Analytics

<a rel="attachment wp-att-33855" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-the-idea-of-blogging-is-similar-to-the-movie-inception-tdis/blogging_totem/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-33855" title="blogging_totem" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/blogging_totem.png" alt="" width="229" height="263" /></a>In the movie Inception, for every dreamer there is a totem. It is a personal object which lets them know if the events around are real or are still a dream. For any blogger or guest blogger the totem is Google analytics.

Yes, Google Analytics is what your blogâ€™s strategy for the future will depend on and if you are getting carried away, Google Analytics will always show you the reality.

## Inception

As explained in the movie, Inception is implanting idea which is simple but not specific deep into the subconscious mind. I read a lot of blogs. I do not end up being regular on all of them. But some blogs I follow religiously. Some of them are not even very popular.

If I am asked why I follow some of these blogs, I cannot really be specific. I am sure most readers have blogs they follow without being able to put their finger on what exactly is about that blog that ticks. Little do they know that the blogger has implanted an idea in their sub-conscious that his articles are something to be followed. ðŸ˜‰
