When I started using Windows 7, I was happy about the way Sticky Notes worked for me, though I was still not satisfied about its limited availability in case I am not using my computer. What if I have to use some other PC and I need part of the notes I have saved using Sticky Notes, the answer to this I found while reading an article online about **NoteSync**.

NoteSync, as the name suggests, lets you manage your notes and then sync them to your Google ID under Google Docs. It works using the Adobe Air platform and is a very light application. The software for iPhone, Android and WebOS platforms are currently in their development phase. I started with the beta 1.2.1 version, NoteSync is now available under its Official version 1.0 as well. However you get to use the official version only for a trial period and will have to buy the license (through Adobe) for only US$ 4.99.

## **How NoteSync can help you more with your work?**

  * Take quick notes without being limited by any software/computer.
  * Automatic sync to your Google Docs account every minute or when you wish.
  * Search notes and even the text inside them quickly.
  * Keyboard shortcuts makes working more easier.
  * Connection to Google is HTTPS based and local storage is also encrypted.
  * All your notes can be found under the folder &#8216;NoteSync&#8217; in Google Docs.

You can still download the 1.1.1 Beta version from the <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/NoteSync-with-Google-Docs.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/NoteSync-with-Google-Docs.shtml', 'link']);" >link</a>. If you know of any other such thing let me know through the comments.
