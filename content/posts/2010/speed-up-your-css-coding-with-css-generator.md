We have covered a few posts on CSS for developers. The last one I had written had information on [how to create CSS borders without having coding knowledge][1]. I came across this helpful website online which can help you use predefined CSS codes which with a User Interface which is simple and probably can speed up your CSS designing quite a lot.

  * As you can see in the image above, the interface is very simple and customizable option are not too complicated. Actually I think the creator of the website <a href="http://www.twitter.com/randyjensen" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twitter.com/randyjensen', 'Randy Jensen']);" >Randy Jensen</a> has included a lot of CSS properties most used by designers and allowing for values to be inserted.
  * The CSS code shows up to the left of the page and preview to the right. I was reading the blog of the website and in which Jensen is said to be working on newer features like tips area and support for gradients and transitions.

I have seen not a lot of developers don&#8217;t trust websites which give out code HTML and CSS code but I think the main purpose of this website is to speed up CSS coding.

Visit <a href="http://css3generator.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://css3generator.com/', 'CSS3 Generator']);" >CSS3 Generator</a> and try out the tool.
