YouTube had a short video of some 30 seconds which was the first one uploaded to its server. This was the [first video on YouTube][1] ever and from there started a revolution. The technology was not new and videos were being streamed before but **YouTube** took this technology and transformed it into a community. Communities make brands and YouTube is no small brand.

Almost everyone reading this post will have a **YouTube** account and if not, surely watches a lot of them. Today **YouTube** announced that it has crossed the mark of 2 billion views per day. That means 2 billion videos are view everyday on YouTube. These numbers are massive and shows that YouTube is a player everywhere in the world. The graph below shows the rise of YouTube over the last five years in terms of views per day.

**YouTube** has clearly shown where it wants to go in the next five years. They claim that on an average each person spend 15 minutes a day on YouTube compared to 5 hours a day in front of the **Television**. With that it is apparent that YouTube wants to have its presence as wide and popular as the television itself.

What do you think? Will YouTube get there?
