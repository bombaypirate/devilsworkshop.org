We all know about Alexa Rankings for websites and it is common knowledge amongst website owners that even if we did not take [Alexa as a true representation][1] for traffic on a website it is something that internet advertisers often take seriously. This is where Google has started to take action by making it easy for advertisers to recognize which website suits their advertising needs.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-25766" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-1000-sites-listed-by-google-adplanner/google_adplanner/"><img class="size-full wp-image-25766 alignnone" style="border: 1px solid grey;" title="google_adplanner" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/google_adplanner.png" alt="" width="350" height="76" /></a>

So Google has now its own list of **Top 1000 sites** ranked according to unique visitors. Interestingly they have excluded their own websites like Google.com and Youtube from the rankings.

### **About <a href="http://www.google.com/adplanner/static/top1000/#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/adplanner/static/top1000/#', 'Google&#8217;s List of top 1000 sites']);" >Google&#8217;s List of top 1000 sites</a>**

  * The #1 ranked website is **Facebook** and **Yahoo** is ranked #2. This is quite interesting in the absence of any website by Google not showing up in the rankings.
  * For every site you can see unique visitors, Page views, site category and if the website has any ads.
  * You can also look up any website&#8217;s data from Google from it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/adplanner" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/adplanner', 'Ad Planner website']);" >Ad Planner website</a>. If you own the the website you are looking up can also opt in and let the website use your websites traffic data from Google Analytics.

So what do you think about Google&#8217;s decision not to include its own websites from being ranked? I guess it opens up two questions which are Is Google trying to hide its number from being compared or is this a way for Google to avoid others trying to say it is not fair when it comes to ranking its own websites?
