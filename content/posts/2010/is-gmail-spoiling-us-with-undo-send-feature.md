Last month I wrote about [Gmail Undo Send][1] feature. It was basically a labs feature with Gmail which allows the email user to cancel the sent email for about 20 seconds. This is very useful when you hit the send button without thinking or mistakenly.

**Undo Send** is a huge boon for many people and I use it quite often. I am not alone, the other day my friend [Rahul Bansal][2] also confirmed that he is addicted to **Undo Send** feature on Gmail.

### What are the other instances of Undo Send features?

  * Gmail obviously has a feature called Undo Send but apart from Gmail we can also see this feature with Skype. **Skype **allows canceling the latest message sent.
  * I do not use this feature a lot but I do spend a lot ofÂ  time on Skype. It is a little discomforting to see a message pop up and then be deleted. Our imagination can start working over-time in such instances. ðŸ˜€
  * Almost all social networks allow us to post updates and links and then delete them. Twitter even allows us to send a Direct Message to a friend and then delete that message from the recipients account.

## Why are such features spoiling us?

I feel such features make us more dependent on an internet connection or a gadget for some basic information. We are using maps to even find our way around a neighborhood we live in. We hardly remember phone numbers now a day as all of them are saved on a mobile phone.

When I say such features are spoiling us, I am not blaming Google or other companies. Just wondering out aloud if we have too many choices and is that making us a little careless with what we say or share online? Sure we can get a lot more work done but we seem to remember a lot less.
