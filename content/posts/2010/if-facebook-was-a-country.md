Ever imagined if** Facebook** was a country how big would it be? Well, with **500 million** active users and growing, it successfully remains to be the largest social networking site around.

If we consider Facebook as a country and if we see the records and try to analyse them we will come out with a result that Facebook is the **third largest country** in the world! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If Facebook continues to grow like this very soon it will become equal to India or can even surpass it. Big status, right !
