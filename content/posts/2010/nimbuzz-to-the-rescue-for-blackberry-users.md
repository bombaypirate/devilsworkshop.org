Recently Saudi Arabia has banned some of the encrypted services with **Blackberry**. The reason given for the banning of the **encrypted messaging services **has been security. The same issue might be faced by **Blackberry **users in India as the government here is also having security concerns. That might be a different debate but one thing is certain that many users might feel disappointed.

According to <a href="http://india.blog.nimbuzz.com/2010/08/09/nimbuzz-provides-government-compliant-communication-solution-for-saudi-arabia-blackberry-users/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://india.blog.nimbuzz.com/2010/08/09/nimbuzz-provides-government-compliant-communication-solution-for-saudi-arabia-blackberry-users/', 'Nimbuzz blog']);" >Nimbuzz blog</a> 10 percent of the Blackberry users have chosen Nimbuzz as a alternative messaging service.

### Features of <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/4288" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/4288', 'Nimbuzz for Blackberry']);" >Nimbuzz for Blackberry</a>

  * **Nimbuzz **works on all **Blackberry **devices which are **OS 4.2.1** and onwards.
  * Nimbuzz allows **Blackberry **users to connect with **Facebook**, **Gtalk**, **Yahoo**, **Skype **and **MSN **contacts.
  * It&#8217;s a free app and also created with Open source technology. The added advantage for users is that it conforms to all government requirements and hence this service probably wont be blocked like Blackberry&#8217;s own encrypted service has been.

Currently many governments have had some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry#Government_Regulation" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry#Government_Regulation', 'issues with the encryption service with ']);" >issues with the encryption service with </a>**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry#Government_Regulation" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry#Government_Regulation', 'Blackberry']);" >Blackberry</a> **but only a coupe of countries have actually banned it. Majority of **Blackberry **users are not doing this to send corporate secrets over this network and might feel let down when their favorite service gets banned. This is where they might find **Nimbuzz **app very useful.

What are your views on **Blackberry **encrypted messaging service being banned? Do you know of any other great free service like **Nimbuzz**? Do let me know through your comments.
