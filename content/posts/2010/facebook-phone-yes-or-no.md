After conquering many fields like applications and games now **Facebook** is planning to build its **phone** or may be an Operating system. There are so many talks going on whether what is Facebook now up to? Some saying yes they are creating a phone and some just not agreeing with others.

As quoted by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/19/facebook-is-secretly-building-a-phone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/19/facebook-is-secretly-building-a-phone/', 'Techcrunch']);" >Techcrunch</a> Facebook is definitely up to something. A phone exclusively for Facebook-sounds interesting. Facebook is very much denying the news. They replied to the Techcrunch news people but I wonder why did they even care to reply if the news was not true? May be they all want to keep the news a hush-hush and let it out as a surprise. But whatever they are thinking this news has surely spread like a fire. Several news resources like ABC news,CNET etc are mentioning about it. There have been more than 335,000 Google hits since 24 hours and still counting.

According to Techcrunch Joe Hewitt of Firefox fame and a creator of Facebook&#8217;s iPhone apps, and Matthew Papakipos, formerly of the Google Chrome OS project &#8211; are busy with the phone. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Whatever the truth I do want Facebook to come up with such a phone. Imagine the kind of revenue it is going to earn and the popularity. Imagine a smart phone being more than just a phone-rather **Facebook phone**!

Things Facebook should remember if they come up with a phone someday can be reasonable price,available all over the world and better privacy! What do you think about Facebook phone? Do share your vies with me.
