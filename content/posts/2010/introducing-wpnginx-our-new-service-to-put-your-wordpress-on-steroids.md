> **When was the last time you have seen Devils Workshop down?**

If you are one of our reader who frequently visits Devils Workshop, chances are seeing this site down are almost nil. Downtime you might have seen here was for [scheduled maintenance few months back][1]. In fact that can be prevented also, had we more time to invest in playing with our servers. ðŸ˜‰

### WpNginx &#8211; The magic behind our great uptime!

Every time, fellow bloggers contact me, wondering about which hosting we are using for such great uptime, I can&#8217;t stop myself from thanking Igor Sysoev, the man who created Nginx webserver.Â Nginx worked for us like a charm.

You may be get a shock to know that, we now run more than **30-sites** with **50K** total pageviews daily from one single VPS and going through analysis of our server logs, it seems that we can handle another **50K** hits daily without upgrading our VPS plan further.

On top of Nginx, we have explored many more ways to optimize websites&#8217;Â performance to the level where our <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog/rtcamp-beats-google-in-yslow-page-speed-grades/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog/rtcamp-beats-google-in-yslow-page-speed-grades/', 'rtCamp.com homepage beats Google.com homepage in YSlow as well as PageSpeed like performanceÂ metrics']);" >rtCamp.com homepage beats Google.com homepage in YSlow as well as PageSpeed like performanceÂ metrics</a>. ðŸ˜‰

To get this kind of performance, we have worked very hard for months. All our efforts pulled together are nowÂ availableÂ as a service which every blogger running high-traffic blog/site can avail. Two of Devils Workshop&#8217;s contributors, [Bapun][2] *(from *<a href="http://www.solidblogger.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.solidblogger.com/', 'SolidBlogger']);" ><em>SolidBlogger</em></a>*)* and [Sri Ganesh][3] *(from *<a href="http://www.symposiumz.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.symposiumz.net/', 'Symposiumz']);" ><em>Symposiumz</em></a>*)*,Â alreadyÂ managed avail our service while we were in close-beta.
