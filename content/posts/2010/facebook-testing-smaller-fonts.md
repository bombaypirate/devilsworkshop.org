When I logged in to my Facebook account this morning I noticed **small fonts**. I was almost furious that who changed the settings on my computer. I even tried the &#8216;Ctrl +&#8217; method to adjust it, but all in vain.

Well after tweaking a bit I realised that it is **Facebook** that is trying out a new feature. Facebook has switched to a smaller font for their feed to make the wall look a bit cleaner. So well let me tell Â you all please do not worry let Facebook try new things if they are trying to make it better.

As far as I think, I do not like this feature. May be I am so much used to it that I do not like it or the new small fonts strain my eyes. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> One good thing about the new feature is that it will let you have more feeds on your wall and the bad thing is that I really have to strain my eyes to see it.

Just for some people who cannot see the smaller fonts, I have a snap shot for you all.

Earlier it was like:

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-smaller-fonts/screenshot_097/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-smaller-fonts/screenshot_097/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3467"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-51115" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/screenshot_097.png" alt="" width="500" height="133" /></a>

and now it is :

<a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-smaller-fonts/screenshot_096/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-testing-smaller-fonts/screenshot_096/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3468"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3468" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/screenshot_096.png" alt="" width="498" height="88" /></a>

What do you think? should Facebook continue with it or it should change it back? Share your views with me through the comments below. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## Latest Update:

With so much of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TWlTTERWHALE/status/29522552669" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/TWlTTERWHALE/status/29522552669', 'negative response from Facebook users all over the world']);" >negative response from Facebook users all over the world</a>, Facebook has given a one liner saying that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/facebook/status/29546378592" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/#!/facebook/status/29546378592', '&#8216;Thanks for the Feedback on the font size.

Lets see if Facebook really changes it and how soon that change is done.
