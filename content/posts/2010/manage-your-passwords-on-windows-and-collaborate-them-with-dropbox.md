A password to any website is very precious and in some cases having a single password for all websites you register and sign-up with is not a wise idea. It means if someone breaks your password for one website it can make all your accounts with that same password very vulnerable.

Here I came across **1Password** a tool to create passwords and save them on your computer in the form of a file.

  * **1Password** Manager is an all in one password storage manager for you while using Windows.
  * You can save up passwords of all your accounts being used with Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer and from then on you do not need to type in your user-name and password at every website.
  * This application does not support Chrome as yet and still is in beta stage for Windows users.

With 1Password I could create key-chains which are groups of user-names and passwords for various websites. For example I have personal and professional accounts for Facebook, Email and Twitter. I could save the key-chain as a file and [sync it with Drop-box][1] so when I went to my office I could retrieve all my accounts I wanted with the key-chain file at my work station. If you liked this post you might also want to read about [Last Pass which is also another password manager][2] we have reviewed on DW.
