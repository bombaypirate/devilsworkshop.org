Following the footsteps of <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-restored-in-pakistan/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-restored-in-pakistan/', 'authorities in Pakistan']);" title="Facebook Restored in Pakistan"  target="_blank">authorities in Pakistan</a>, Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Authority has also lifted the ban imposed on Facebook nearly a week ago. Similar to what happened in Pakistan, a number of protesters were seen on the streets in Bangladesh in last week of may, protesting against the &#8220;Everyone Draw Mohammad&#8221; day organized by a group of Facebook users.

Bangladesh Telecommunication officials said that they have restored access to Facebook in Bangladesh after the US-based social networking website agreed to remove objectionable images from their website. This step came as a relief to Facebook fans in Bangladesh, as it became hugely popular among the people.
