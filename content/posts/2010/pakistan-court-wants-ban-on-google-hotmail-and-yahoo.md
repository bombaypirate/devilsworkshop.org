Pakistan has recently had a bit of a love hate relationship with the internet and companies that provide internet services. First <a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/05/20/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/05/20/facebook-banned-in-pakistan/', 'Pakistan had banned Facebook']);" >Pakistan had banned Facebook</a> over a controversy and then also ended up putting the clamps on [Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia][1].

Most people think bans do not serve any purpose as in today&#8217;s time the internet is very symbiotic and content is not always URL specific. It is usually shared across various mediums which might end up making the ban pretty ineffective.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-27266" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/pakistan-court-wants-ban-on-google-hotmail-and-yahoo/google_banned/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27266" title="google_banned" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/google_banned.png" alt="" width="300" height="283" /></a>

According to a report in <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pak-court-orders-ban-on-Google-Yahoo-Hotmail-6-other-websites/articleshow/6082516.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pak-court-orders-ban-on-Google-Yahoo-Hotmail-6-other-websites/articleshow/6082516.cms', 'Times of India']);" >Times of India</a>, a Bhawalpur bench of Lahore High Court ordered **Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, Amazon**,** YouTube and Bing** to be blocked or banned on a petition against these websites that they were publishing sacrilegious material.

The Pakistani authorities have not carried out the court order suggesting it has not received the orders but heard about it through media reports.

Hopefully these websites will not be blocked in Pakistan as such objectionable material is often unnoticed until its banned or a issue is raised. This I guess is probably counter productive.

Do you think these bans really serve any purpose? Can the internet be regulated? Do let us know through your comments.
