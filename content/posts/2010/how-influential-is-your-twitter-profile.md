We all have heard of Google&#8217;s Page Rank and how it is used in the algorithm for giving you relevant search results. One way Google does is to determine how influential your website it. But how does one determine the influence of one website compared to the other. It is simple, it is by way of references or in case of search engine language we can call it back-links. **<a href="http://twitter.grader.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.grader.com', 'Twitter Grader']);" >Twitter Grader</a>** is a website which ranks your Twitter ID and gives you an indication of how influential it is.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-20268" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-influential-is-your-twitter-profile/twitter_influence/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20268" title="twitter_influence" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/twitter_influence.png" alt="" width="500" height="182" /></a>

Here I tried to find my level of influence on **Twitter grader** and I was ranked 1,574,610 out of over 6 million. I got a grade of 74 out of 100 which is like a rating. I looked up how they came up with this ranking and ratingÂ  and it seems they have a algorithm which they do not want to share. This is obviously because they do not want people to game the system.

But here are some of the things **Twitter Grader** takes into account to give you a ranking.

  * The number of followers you have is very important. Even **Twitter Grader **accepts it is a easy way to create more followers by following people continuously and randomly. But what Twitter Grader also takes into account is what sort of influence your followers have.
  * Updates are also given weight in the rating. A decent amount of updates means you are taking care to revise your profile but too many updates can make you lose a few points as it would be more like spamming.
  * Follower vs Following ratio is important but it goes downwards once you start engageing regularly with a lot of updates. Another factor is how many of your tweets are re-tweeted.

I liked this web service as it gives me a good idea of how well I am doing with Twitter as I use it primarily to interact with people and share things online. For professional blogger it is important to have a **Twitter ID** which has significant influence. For someone in Internet marketing I guess it is absolutely important to have a Twitter account which is highly influential.

What do you think about it? Do check out **<a href="http://twitter.grader.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.grader.com', 'Twitter Grader']);" >Twitter Grader</a>** and drop in your comments.
