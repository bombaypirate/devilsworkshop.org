Google has recently introduced a website on which just about anyone can create a Android application. No, I am not talking about Android being open source and hence any programmer can create a app. Anyone means anybody, even people with no programming abilities.

The great thing about **Android App builde**r is that it allows us to get just simply used predefined drag and drop boxed into the interface and create new applications. This basically can be quite revolutionary where in we could create simple customized applications for various things we might need on our phone.

The idea by Google is not really to create Android app makers out of all of us. What Google hopes is that it can get more developers started and familiarize themselves with Android. More the number of developers getting interested in making Android Apps will only end up helping Android.

At the moment we can only sign up for this App builder and wait for access. Sign up but visiting the <a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://appinventor.googlelabs.com', 'Android App Builder landing page']);" >Android App Builder landing page</a>.

*Look at this video demo to see how Android App builder can be used.*
