You might be aware the the latest **iPhone 4** have been having a lot of issues with network being lost if held in the hand and the problem is apparently resolved by using the phone in a case. This has been probably Apple&#8217;s biggest embarrassment as it has been know to put out products which are vigorously tested.

Apple has made a great deal of advertisements mocking Windows for its buggy software and the fact that it does not get the simple things right. They have recently thanks to the iPhone, invaded into the territory of Nokia.

So what does **Nokia** do after **Apple iPhone 4** woes? It decides to mock Apple with its own instructions on how you can hold a Nokia handset without losing connectivity. ðŸ˜›

<a rel="attachment wp-att-27883" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/nokia-makes-fun-of-apples-iphone-4s-network-loss/nokia_pokes_fun_iphone/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27883" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/nokia_pokes_fun_iPhone.png" alt="" width="440" height="351" /></a>

Nokia further mocks iPhone by saying that the key function of its mobile phones is to be able to receive and make calls. ðŸ˜›

Most times when there is a public relations disaster the competitor will always take advantage of it. We all know about Apple&#8217;s fantastic advertising ability especially when they [dished it out to Microsoft][1] and lately its [response to Adobe&#8217;s &#8220;we love choice&#8221; campaign][2].

What goes round comes around and I guess it is Apples time to take a few knocks from Nokia.

What are you views on** Nokia** making fun of **iPhone** network issues? Do let me know through your comments.
