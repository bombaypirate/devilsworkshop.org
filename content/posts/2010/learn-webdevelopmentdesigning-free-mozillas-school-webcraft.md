Mozilla is set to begin a new training program for web-designers and developers in Jan 2011 for students and professionals, which would provide a 100% free developer training resource run in partnership with the Peer 2 Peer University.

The School of Webcraft is not a new establishment, as 15 classes were held in the previous semester, but they were more or less related to non-developer topics such as SEO. Now, Mozilla is trying to get around 30 classes for the January semester.

The length of the classes would be between 6-10 weeks. They’ll cover topics relevant to web designers and developers, including **HTML5, JavaScript and CSS**. Any one who considers himself a novice or an expert can join the course. The course is expected to be started on January 26.

Students can learn through a combination of free and open learning materials, online study groups and hands-on assignments that test their skills.Since its an open project, expert developers can join in as well, and share their knowledge with the learning community. the Peer to Peer University claims that their classes are globally accessible, 100% free and powered entirely by learners, mentors and contributors.

By creating a completely free, open training ground for developers and would-be developers, Mozilla hopes to remedy some of the problems surrounding technology education.

Registrations for this program start on **January 8 2011**.
