An image of a word cloud can be quite eye catching and very useful to quickly say a lot about something within seconds. For instance a word cloud of **Devils&#8217; Workshop** can show all the relevant and important words associated with the blog and give you a pretty good idea about what we are all about. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Wordle.net is a great website which creates a word cloud on any website URL or even a a list of words you enter manually. Below is a screen shot of one such word cloud.

  * Wordle works on Java and creates a **&#8216;word cloud&#8217; **of which you can take a screenshot and share it.
  * You can choose three options on the content part which are a group of words, words from a webpage and also another cool feature which creates a word cloud of tags you have as on a del.icio.us account.
  * There are a range of options to edit the word cloud. You can choose to have all the words displayed vertically or horizontally. Or also choose a mix of them. You can customize the colors and also delete unwanted common words in English. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This seems to be quite useful for someone looking to create a presentation. Give Wordle a try and do let me know your views through your comments.
