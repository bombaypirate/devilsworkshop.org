  1. **Drivers :** You can install drivers from your motherboard CD or if you want latest drivers for your PC go to the official website of which the motherboard is and download the latest drivers and install them in your PC.
  2. **Winrar :** The most commonly used tool is <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rarlab.com/', 'Winrar']);" >Winrar</a>. After installation of fresh copy of Windows, it is a must have tool.
  3. **Anti Virus and Firewall :** If you want a free antivirus product, I recommend using <a href="http://www.avg.com/in-en/free-antivirus" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.avg.com/in-en/free-antivirus', 'AVG 11 Free']);" >AVG 11 Free</a> or <a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download', 'Avast Home Edition']);" >Avast Home Edition</a>. For a free firewall product, you can go with <a href="http://personalfirewall.comodo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalfirewall.comodo.com/', 'Commodo Firewall Pro']);" >Commodo Firewall Pro</a>.
  4. **Download Manager :** There are many download managers out there but one of my favorites is <a href="http://www.freedownloadmanager.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freedownloadmanager.org', 'Free Download Manager']);" >Free Download Manager</a>, alternatively you can also go for <a href="http://www.flashget.com/en/download.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flashget.com/en/download.htm', 'Flashget']);" >Flashget</a>.
  5. **Tweaking Software :** You must have a Windows tweaking application installed in your system. I use Tuneup Utilities 2009 and if you want a freeware I recommend you to use <a href="http://www.tweaknow.com/powerPack.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tweaknow.com/powerPack.html', 'TweakNow PowerPack']);" >TweakNow PowerPack</a>.
  6. **Internet Browser :** No doubt, <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.getfirefox.com', 'Firefox']);" >Firefox</a> still takes the first place. Although it is a personal choice when it comes to browsers. I personally like <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/chrome', 'Chrome']);" >Chrome</a>.
  7. **Pdf Document Viewer :** The most commonly used pdf viewer is <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://get.adobe.com/reader/', 'Adobe Acrobat']);" >Adobe Acrobat</a>. If you want a light and easy to use reader than you can try <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/', 'Foxit']);" >Foxit</a>.

Have I missed any application which you think should be included in the list? Please let me know through comments.
