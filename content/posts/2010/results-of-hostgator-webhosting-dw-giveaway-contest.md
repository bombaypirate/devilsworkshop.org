Over all we had 66 valid entries and the post was Retweeted a 114 times! As Harsh had explained in his post that this contest was a way to encourage people who are still shy of using WordPress because of the cost involved. The prize is <a href="http://rt.cx/hostgator/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.cx/hostgator/', 'hostgator baby plan']);" >hostgator baby plan</a> one year subscription which is worth 120$. You can host multiple domains in this plan along with bandwidth and storage being unlimited.

We used** Random.Org** . After compiling the whole list of comments which are valid, I used<a href="http://random.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://random.org', ' Radnom.or']);" > Radnom.or</a>g lists to create a randomized list. The one at the top was the winner.

Congratulations to **Vicky** whose name popped up first once the list was randomized. He wins the **Hostgator goodies** worth **$120**.

*Here is the video of the winner being selected through Random.org*
