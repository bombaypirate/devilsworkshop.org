You must have been to websites where you can register through your Facebook id and password. Well, now it is made simpler and more social.

Paul Tarjan, a Facebook engineer has made a new <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/user_registration" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/docs/user_registration', 'registration tool']);" >registration tool</a> that will give website owners the ability to make social sign ups easier than before. It can be a better way than using Facebook connect.

## This new registration tool is for:

  1. Websites that want to give an option for users without Facebook accounts.
  2. A website that needs an info more than Facebook can give.
  3. A website that works on a traditional HTML form.

According to a survey it is said that people will stay on those websites more which allow them to bring their friends with them. We all know the <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-friendships-world-map/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-friendships-world-map/', 'Facebook friendships ']);" >Facebook friendships </a> so no need to think that it wont be successful.

### How it works ?

The registration tool is an iframe that any website can use and include in their program. When user comes to such website he can see a form already filled about his information. This will only be possible if he has already logged into Facebook account. He can choose to sign up further after seeing what the site is requesting the user.

So privacy issue is I guess solved here. We want to control what we share. What do you think about this step by Facebook. Feel free to share your views through the comments below.
