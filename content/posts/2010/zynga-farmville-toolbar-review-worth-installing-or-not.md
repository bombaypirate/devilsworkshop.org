If you are a FavmVille addict and checks your farm again and again for harvesting fully grown crops. Now you don&#8217;t need to do so cuz you can track your farm using the official toolbar of FarmVille by Zynga, the company who created FarmVille, Cafe World FishVille and Mafia Wars.

Now you can track your bonus points, get the latest updates from FarmVille&#8217;s official blog and check the time when your crops will be ready to harvest with a single toolbar. Well not only this, the FarmVille toolbar has an inbuilt search bar powered by Yahoo. You can also choose game between FarmVille and Mafia Wars (another popular game by Zynga).

### How to Install?

  1. To install this toolbar use <a href="http://toolbar.zynga.com/install/farmville/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://toolbar.zynga.com/install/farmville/', 'this link']);" target="_blank">this link</a>.(<a href="http://toolbar.zynga.com/install/farmville/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://toolbar.zynga.com/install/farmville/', 'http://toolbar.zynga.com/install/farmville/']);" target="_blank">http://toolbar.zynga.com/install/farmville/</a>).
  2. Connect your facebook profile with it.
  3. Click on install.
  4. Finally click on allow (on the top right of your window) and download the toolbar.
  5. Restart your browser.

### But few things you have to consider before installing this toolbar.(Advantages and Disadvantages)

  1. This toolbar is compatible with Firefox 2+ versions only.
  2. This toolbar is very heavy (approx. 700 KB) as compared to other toolbars we use in Firefox. So obviously this will make your browser little slow.
  3. This toolbar has a link of Facebook inbox which is good.
  4. This toolbar seems to be a way of making Zynga and FarmVille more popular rather than making FarmVille more convenient for users, unnecessary links of forum and other games shows it all.
  5. You can disable some features of this toolbar by selecting &#8216;Toolbar Options&#8217; after right clicking on it.

Well all I want to say about this toolbar is that this is meant for real FarmVille addicts, it&#8217;s quite useless for others. The purpose of making this toolbar is to keep people reminding about their Farm so that they will return again and again. ðŸ˜‰

### So, tell us what do you think about this toolbar?
