I had written previously about a short trailer of the movie on the Facebook phenomenon called &#8216;The Social Network&#8217;. It has just voices and dialogues which gave a slightly edgy and dark motive to the film.

Apparently the movie is probably a drama with comedy and that comes across with its latest theatrical trailer released. Look up more details of the movie at <a href="http://www.thesocialnetwork-movie.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thesocialnetwork-movie.com/', 'their official website']);" >their official website</a>.
