I seem to be enjoying this music syndrome which I am going through these past few days. Keeping up with the theme of few of my past posts, here is what I&#8217;ve managed to lay my hands on this time. If you feel the need to try composing music but lack the time to learn the art, here is a simpler way out. These free online applications will soothe those itchy nerves down and make the club popping with your tracks.

So all set to be &#8220;DJ You&#8221; ? Hang on guys, there is a list!

## #1. <a href="http://www.inudge.net/index.en.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.inudge.net/index.en.html', 'iNudge']);" target="_blank">iNudge</a>

Create music with random clicks across your screen? That seems to be the concept behind this application. Its extremely simple to use, but that wasn&#8217;t it for me. What really clicked for me, is somehow it didn&#8217;t matter how random the clicks were, it seemed to sound good. It has got a user-friendly interface which is good. You can toggle between 8 sound types as well as mess around with basics like tempo, audio panning, volume settings.

## #2. <a href="http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix', 'Tone Matrix']);" target="_blank">Tone Matrix</a>

It is a simpler version of **inudge**. It should amuse you for a while when you are overworked. It is not really for serious music editing.

Created by the makers of Tone Matrix, Audiotool is an high-end music mixing software. It&#8217;s a virtual DJ console, right to the part of plugging in the wires of additional devices you pull out. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with mixing, don&#8217;t be worried as there are some fun <a href="http://www.audiotool.com/tutorials" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.audiotool.com/tutorials', 'tutorials']);" target="_blank">tutorials</a> as well.

You will get three choices when you will click on the link &#8211; <a href="http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/themusicstudio/launch.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/themusicstudio/launch.html', 'Music Studio']);" target="_blank">Music Studio</a>, <a href="http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/dubstep/launch.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/dubstep/launch.html', 'Dubstep Studio']);" target="_blank">Dubstep Studio</a>,Â  and <a href="http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/scion/launch.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/scion/launch.html', 'Electro House Blender']);" target="_blank">Electro House Blender</a>. Each of them is just as good and easy to use. There is also <a href="http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/ives/launch.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://remixer.clubcreate.com/v2/ives/launch.html', 'Charles Ives Music Lab']);" >Charles Ives Music Lab</a> which is made by the same creators.

## #5. <a href="http://www.jamstudio.com/Studio/index.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jamstudio.com/Studio/index.htm', 'Jamstudio']);" target="_blank">Jamstudio</a>

One of the most popular of all these is Jamstudio and for all the right reasons. It has managed to retain the most important features necessary for music editing &#8211; instruments, sound effects and notes. It has over 300,000 users, which is probably a good audience for your grand debut.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31710" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/5-sites-to-compose-and-edit-your-music-online/jamstudio/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31710" title="Jamstudio" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Jamstudio.png" alt="" width="314" height="184" /></a>

So that I guess is a good range for all of you to try. Don&#8217;t panic if it seems too complicated because there are tutorials or guidelines given which make it easy to deal with.

I love these innovations like these because you can choose to learn the tricks of a new job everyday.
