Twitter has some very interesting options which a lot of newbies do not know about but find out very soon once they stick around on. As a blogger tweets can play a great role in sharing and looking up some interesting things online. Anyone using Twitter extensively will often use the **hashtag** to look up what people are saying about something interesting. Like searching for **#wordpress** for looking up people and their views on the WordPress. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

There is a online website which allows you to automatically follow all the Twitter users who have used a particular hashtag recently. ðŸ˜‰

<a rel="attachment wp-att-28953" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/search-and-follow-everyone-using-a-trending-topic-on-twitter-in-one-go/follow_blast_twitter/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28953" title="follow_blast_twitter" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/follow_blast_twitter.png" alt="" width="550" height="561" /></a>

### Features of <a href="http://www.blastfollow.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blastfollow.com/', 'Blast Follow']);" >Blast Follow</a>

  * Just enter the hashtag topic you want to look up and enter it in the website along with your Twitter credentials.
  * Once you click on **&#8216;Blast&#8217; **the web tool starts to automatically start following everyone who has used the hashtag in recent times.
  * There is a note of caution while using this tool. Try to avoid very popular trending topics as you might end up following hundreds of accounts in a matter of minutes which is quite undesirable.
  * I use **Blast Follow** to look up users in very niche and unique topics on which they trend.

If you like following people for their views on Twitter and look up if a particular account is spamming too much or too little with [another neat tool called FollowCost][1].

Do look up <a href="http://www.blastfollow.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blastfollow.com/', 'Blast Follow']);" >Blast Follow</a> and let me know if you like the features. Also do let me know of any similar services and your Twitter strategy when it comes to following people.
