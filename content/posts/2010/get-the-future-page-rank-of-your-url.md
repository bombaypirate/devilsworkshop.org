Every time we search for something on Google Search, Page Ranks are supposed to be at the center of how Google ends up calculating which search results is best suited and reliable. Most webmaster spend days wondering when the next [announcement of Google Page Rank ][1]would be made.

I came across this <a href="http://www.seomastering.com/pagerank-prediction.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.seomastering.com/pagerank-prediction.php', 'Page Rank Predictor']);" >Page Rank Predictor</a> which tries to predict the page rank of any website.

The web application takes it for granted that Google does not reveal the exact Page Rank of a website and shows a Page Rank which is lower than the actual one so it can factor in a website losing credibility in the short term.

### **About <a href="http://www.seomastering.com/pagerank-prediction.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.seomastering.com/pagerank-prediction.php', 'Page Rank Predictor']);" >Page Rank Predictor</a>**

  * As I mentioned before this **Predictor** app tries to show the correct **Page Rank** compared to the one announced by Google.
  * This basically means a **Page Rank** is lower or equal to the number given by the Predictor and hence you can expect that if there is a big different between your current and predicted Page Rank then it might be changing the next time Google announces **Page Rank updates**.
  * This PR Predictor can be taken seriously with more data being checked over a period of time to see if it really can predict the correct Page Rank for the future.

I guess if **Page Rank Predictor** can be taken seriously then **Devils&#8217; Workshop** could boast of a great PR in the near future but that I guess only time and hard work can ensure. ðŸ˜›

Do try out Page Rank Predictor and let me know your views and opinions on it through your comments.
