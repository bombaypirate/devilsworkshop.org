Mind Mapping is basically organizing your thoughts with a detailed diagram so that you do not lose out on anything and basically a great way to give an insights into a plan. We can say a mind map is something similar to a flow chart without the logical operators thrown in. It is more like a visual representation of a plan which with one glance can be understood by another person without much explaining to do.

Here are three great online tools for creating mind maps online and storing them.

### **#1. <a href="http://think.ajsands.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://think.ajsands.com/', 'Think &#8211; Mind Map online App']);" >Think &#8211; Mind Map online App</a>**

  * Think is a great online tool and has a very innovative style of showing the mind map (as you can see in the image below).
  * It also allows creating private and public mindmaps and this you can do by creating them through Open IDs, Google ID or Yahoo ID.
  * I liked the classy style of showing links and also the simple and easy way to use the interface.

### **#2. <a href="http://www.text2mindmap.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.text2mindmap.com/', 'Text 2 Mind Map']);" >Text 2 Mind Map</a>**

  * Text 2 Mind Map does exactly what the name suggests. It converts any Text into a Mind Map.
  * If you are drawing up a list and sub-list this tool is ideal to use. Create your list and sub-lists and let the website map it out.
  * There is no need to sign in and all you have to do is **download** the map as a **JPEG file**.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-23756" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/3-great-free-online-tools-to-create-mindmaps/mind_map_text2mindmap/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23756" title="mind_map_text2mindmap" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/mind_map_text2mindmap.png" alt="" width="550" height="275" /></a>

### **#3. <a href="http://en.ekpenso.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.ekpenso.com', 'Ekpenso Mind Map']);" >Ekpenso Mind Map</a>**

  * Ekpenso is a multi-language service to create Mind Maps. It also allows creating public and private Mind Maps.
  * This website requires you to register and then use the service (It does support Open IDs).
  * The best part of this website is you can **download** the map as an image and also as a **PDF** file. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I feel creating mind maps is like a advanced version of creating a list of things to do in the future except with mind map tools you can link one to do list to another in innovative ways. ðŸ˜‰
