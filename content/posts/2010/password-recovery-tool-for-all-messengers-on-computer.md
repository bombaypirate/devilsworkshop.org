Forgetting passwords is a common problem. We have previously covered [how to recover passwords from protected excel files][1] in our past post. Here is one more I thought you might like as it covers recovering passwords from the messengers you use on the computer.

If you use many chat messengers and have unique passwords for each of them. Forgetting one such password is a situation many of us might have found ourselves in. In this case what you need is a password recovery tool specifically meant for messengers.
