I feel now that everything can be done with [**Greasemonkey scripts**][1]. I have always thought how nice it would be if I could just know who all removed me from their friend list or if any of my friends deleted his/her **Facebook **profile. All this and more can now be done by using this Greasemonkey Script.

## How to install this Script?

  * Go<a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/58852" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/58852', ' here']);" > here</a>.
  * Click on Install.
  * Refresh browser.

## What does the Script do?

  * This script tells you which friend has deleted you from his/her friend list.
  * It tells you which friend has hidden or deleted his Facebook profile.
  * You can check out all the pending or awaiting friend requests and delete them here.

That is instead of going on each and everyone&#8217;s profile page we could delete all at once at one place itself. By using this Script that is possible. It shows all the pending friend requests which you can delete.

### How to use it ?

After installing you will see a new button which appears on the upper right hand side of the Facebook profile. If any friend has removed you from his/her account you will see the notification under **Unfriends**.
