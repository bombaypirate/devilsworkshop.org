If you love using your computer for writing there is a good chance that you would want a peaceful environment which allows you to think and write without distraction. Many bloggers end up blogging during the nights because it does give you a peaceful environment. No doorbells, no phones ringing and no traffic noise in the off chance you live near a busy road street. These are distractions out there in the world which you cannot do much about except lock yourself in a room or work at nights.

The distractions on your computer can be a very irritating. Email notifiers, chat clients, Tweet Deck pop-ups and many more applications running on your computer can actually disturb you from your writing. This is where I like writing tools which are distraction free. Deepak Jain had reviewed [JDarkRoom Writing tool][1] a few months ago on our blog and I came across CreaWriter writing tool which I like better.

  * The option is present to change the background image along with also change the ambient background sound.
  * The ambient sound can be a little irritating and I personally find it best to turn it off.
  * The other option is to also keep the writing area transparent, which might allow a little distraction to be allow. ðŸ˜‰

I do not think anyone writing less that 400 words would be using this tool. It is not a blogging tool but very useful for writing for long periods without a break in the chain of thoughts.
