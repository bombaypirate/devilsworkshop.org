Most people using **Windows XP** might be familiar with the email client called Outlook Express. With Windows 7 there was no pre-installed email client and one has to install the Windows Live suite for access to the email client called Live Mail. I started playing around Live Mail to check how I could download my mails from Hotmail and Gmail to my computer.

First <a href="http://download.live.com/wlmail" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://download.live.com/wlmail', 'Download Windows Live Mail']);" >Download Windows Live Mail</a> for your **Windows 7 Operating System**.

### **Configure your Hotmail or MSN account with Live Mail**

  * While you have opened **Windows Live Mail**, just click on a the link that reads &#8220;**Add email account**&#8221; and you will asked to enter your email details.
  * Enter the Email address which is your Hotmail account along with the Password. You can choose to save the password and then the Display name. (see image below)
  * Once done just click on** Next** and **Live Mail** will start downloading your email directly from your **Hotmail** or **MSN** email id.

**Windows Live Mail** is a great software and free to download from the Microsoft website. For people who do not have a always &#8220;ON&#8221; internet connection this can be a decent idea to download your mail and send it all at once.
