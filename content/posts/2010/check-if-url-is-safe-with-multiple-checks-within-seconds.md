If you are a net addict then you probably surf and look up hundreds of URLs over a week. Ofcourse many domains are visited regularly and hence you are quite sure about these links from a safety point of view. But it is always a good idea to see if the link you are visiting is safe or not. I had written about [Web of Trust addon which can be used with various browsers][1].

<a rel="attachment wp-att-27520" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/check-if-url-is-safe-with-multiple-checks-within-seconds/url_void/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27520" title="URL_void" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/URL_void.png" alt="" width="550" height="332" /></a>

### **About <a href="http://www.urlvoid.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.urlvoid.com', 'URL Void']);" >URL Void</a>**

  * **URL Void** actually looked up a URL you enter and checks if it is clean or infected using** Web Of Trust (WOT), McAfee SiteAdvisor, Google Diagnostic **and **Norton SafeWeb** to check it up.
  * **URL Void** also displays the websites IP Address, IP Country, IP Host and other detections of infections.
  * **URL Void** also shows us the latest infected websites and also a has sections where it shows the latest attacks caused with URL on its <a href="http://blog.urlvoid.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.urlvoid.com/', 'blog']);" >blog</a>.

Personally I would have liked this service to had a add-on or extension instead of it being a place on the net where I had to enter the URL manually. I still like URL Void for its various network of services checking a web url. ðŸ˜‰

Do try out<a href="http://www.urlvoid.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.urlvoid.com', ' URL Void']);" > URL Void</a> for a safe internet experience and do let me know if you are aware of better alternatives through your comments.
