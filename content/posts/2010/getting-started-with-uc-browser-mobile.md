If you are using web on your mobile, chances are high that you are using a third party browser like Opera Mini, Bolt or UC Browser. While all are good, UC Browser seems to fulfill most of my needs. But it may feel awkward for those who were using Opera Mini for a long time and are new to the browser.  So I would like to give a brief guide to use it.

### **#1. Grab the App**

PC Download &#8211; <a href="http://www.ucweb.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ucweb.com', 'www.ucweb.com']);" >www.ucweb.com</a>

WAP Download &#8211; <a href="http://wap.uc.cn" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wap.uc.cn', 'wap.ucweb.com']);" >wap.ucweb.com</a>

iPhone Download &#8211; <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uc-browser-english-version/id374473033%3Fmt%3D8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uc-browser-english-version/id374473033%3Fmt%3D8', 'iTunes link']);" >iTunes link</a>

Install it as any other app. To change application permissions, in Nokia s40, highlight UC Browser, then go to your phone settings by:

  * *Options>Communication>Network Access>Always Allowed, *
  * *Options>Data Access>Read Data>Always Allowed, *
  * *Options>Data Access>Add and Edit Data>Always Allowed.*

UC Browser is available for different platforms including Java, Symbian, Windows Mobile, iPhone etc.

In jailbroken iPhones, to add UC Browser in Cydia(The unofficial AppStore), goto

  * *Manage>Sources>Edit>Add>http://wap.uc.cn/en*

For Java Platform, a standard version, as well as a low memory version is available. The low memory version is for lower end phones that don&#8217;t doesn’t support the standard version. It doesn’tn&#8217;t have some features of the standard version.

This article is primarily intended for the Standard Java Version.

### **#2. Let it Initialize**

After installing, open UC Browser. It will first check your network to set up an more fluent connection with the server for browsing.

After network test, it will update the  startpage and other data. If initialization fails, then try restarting the browser, or check your network settings.

### **#3. Choose a Theme**

**<img class="wp-image-50160" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_9NdcYBKsZyo/TERdAUjMsKI/AAAAAAAAAdg/SU5MkpnMiIo/clip_image048_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="clip_image048" />**

Choose a theme for the browser as you like to make it unique from the others  that suits you . Go to **Menu>Preference>Themes>Manage Themes** and select a theme. You can download more themes from

*Menu>Preference>Themes>Download Themes*. After download, it will ask you to install the theme. Or you can later install it from

*Menu>File>Download Manager* and then press &#8220;1&#8221; at the theme and choose &#8220;Install&#8221;.

*Menu>Help>Help Contents*.

### **#7. Understand the Startpage**

**![clip_image002][5]**

The Startpage of UC Browser is very intuitive. At the top, you have the “Bookmarks” and &#8220;Home&#8221; icons to switch (press “left soft key” or “3” button on your phone) between the start page and bookmarks. Next is the Search bar which lets you search the web. Below it you&#8217;ll find the Address bar which lets you enter web addresses.

![clip_image004][6]

Below the Address bar, there are drop down tabs with recommended and sorted links for you to get the site through a few clicks instead of typing the long addresslinks. The lowermost drop down tab shows your History. You can expand a tab by clicking on it. The last part shows some sponsored links.

### **#8. Browse the Web**

After the customizations and understanding the startpagestart page, now you are ready to surf the web. To go to a website, just enter the URL in the Address bar. e.g. &#8211; http://forum.ucweb.com and press Ok. The page will load in few seconds. You can use the navigation keys or your phone&#8217;s keypad to navigate through the page.

You can save the page for later viewing from

*Menu>File>Save Page*.

![clip_image044][7]

To refresh/reload the page, go to

*Menu>Navigation>Refresh*.

And it provides a auto refresh function to keep your update with the news you don’t want to miss.

### **#9. Search the Web**

It is easy with the inbuilt search function. Click on the Search bar and enter your query. You can select from predefined search engines given. Then click &#8220;Search&#8221; to get the resultssearch the web.

### **#10. Use the Context Menu**

The Context menu lets you access the most used functions easily. The default Shortcut is &#8220;1&#8221;.

In normal, it gives option to open new window, copy text, share etc.

You can also search from the highlighted text.

When you highlight an image, you can use the context menu to Zoom or Save the image.

While you highlight a link, you can copy the link, open it in a new tab, or save the linked file.

### **#11. Download Files**

**![clip_image020][8]**

When you click on any download, you&#8217;ll be prompted with generally three options, &#8220;Open&#8221;, &#8220;Save&#8221; and &#8220;Cancel&#8221;. The options provide by the browser change as different file types. For Zip and PDF files, you will have an option &#8220;Preview&#8221; to directly view the contents. For apps, you&#8217;ll have a &#8220;Install&#8221; option. To download the file with your default browser, select open. Select save to download the file with UC Browser download manager. And you’ll find the speed is much faster than the built-in browser.

### **#12. Upload Files**

When you are on a site with the upload dialog box, click &#8220;Browse&#8221;.

Then you&#8217;ll be presented with two options. You can either upload from your phone or take a photo instantly to upload.

### **#13. Install Apps Downloaded with UC Browser**

If you use a s40 phone, the apps you download with UC Browser are marked as unsupported format. To install them, lets take an example:.

Suppose you tried to download app.jar. UC will automatically rename it to app_jar as it cannot save it as app.jar due to phone limitations.

So to install the app, just rename it to app.jar from app_jar with your default file manager.

**#14. Protect Your Privacy**

You can easily delete the browsing and search history, cookies, cache and traffic to protect your privacy. Go to *Menu>Tools>Clear History*.

**#15.Go Advanced**

Now, when you are ready to surf the web in a new way, feel free to explore the advanced functions in UC Browser. UC Browser gives much more flexibility and more control over your browser.

**Conclusion**

Though UC Browser is designed to be easy, it may feel less user friendly for new users. Hope this guide will help.
