Are you in a mood to just go through some videos or images without searching them that is just randomly? Well I have a suggestion for that.

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">There is a new service named as <strong><a href=" www.friendshuffle.com">Friend Shuffle</a></strong>. It allows you to randomly view links liked by your friends using Facebook connect. Here you can login using your Facebook login id or twitter id (twitter one not working currently) and view the videos your friends have liked. You can click on <strong>I like it too</strong> or <strong>Shuffle</strong>. It is a nice way of randomly discovering the videos. It is like <strong>StumbleUpon</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px">When you use StumbleUpon you have to tell your browser what are the things you like and then it shows you images or videos accordingly. But here in Friend Shuffle you do not have to tell your browser about your favourite things, you will be shown videos or images according to your friend&#8217;s likes. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px"><a href="http://fbknol.com/friend-shuffle-challenges-stumbleupon/screenshot_028/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/friend-shuffle-challenges-stumbleupon/screenshot_028/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3111"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-54064" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/screenshot_028.png" alt="" width="302" height="50" /></a></span>

If you click on &#8216;I like it too!&#8217; this gets published on your Facebook home page saying &#8216;ABC liked a particular thing on Friend shuffle&#8217;. :)You Â can comment or like it further. It shows you the links according to the Facebook likes.

This can challenge StumbleUpon. What do you think? ðŸ˜‰ If I have to randomly view images and videos I will choose Friend Shuffle because even randomly it will give me better search results. As we know our likes are somewhat Â similar to our friends, that&#8217;s what makes us Friends. Right? Will you continue using Stumble Upon or you are going to try Friend Shuffle.
