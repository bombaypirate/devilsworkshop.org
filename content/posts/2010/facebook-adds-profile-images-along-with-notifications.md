It looks like Facebook constantly updates the UI for its users and the latest new change has been showing profile images along with notifications. It still shows about six updates but they fill up a lot more space because of the profile pictures. This is a littler irritating for some users and they prefer older version with just a name.

  This new notifications format really makes no different for me but it might be quite attractive and user friendly in some cases as people end up recognizing profile pictures much more easily than names written down. This could be Facebook&#8217;s way of encouraging more interaction which obviously leads to the increasing relevance of information on Facebook.
