World&#8217;s best social networking website Facebook is opening an office in India which is going to be it&#8217;s first office in Asia as well. Facebook&#8217;s office in the southern city of India, Hyderabad will be having an advertising team and a developers department. This office will supplement it&#8217;s other offices around the world like of Alto, Ireland and Texas.

Don Faul the director of global online operations, said in a statement that,

> We expect our new office in Hyderabad to tap into the region&#8217;s strong pool of talented people who understand operations and technology, and help us more effectively serve the needs of our users, advertisers and developers around the world.<figure id="attachment_1042" style="width: 196px;" class="wp-caption alignleft">

I think this statement by the director describes clearly the purpose of selecting India as their Asian base. Obviously this is going to help Facebook as well as it&#8217;s users and advertisers a lot for business. This will create a world wide round the clock multi-language support system. Currently there are around 8 million Indians on Facebook out of 400 million total profiles.
