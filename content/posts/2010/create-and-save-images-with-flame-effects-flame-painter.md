Have you ever thought of playing with fire? I discovered that I could while going through this Photoshop tutorial by <a href="http://bestphotoshoptutorials.net/2010/06/07/add-brilliant-light-effects/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bestphotoshoptutorials.net/2010/06/07/add-brilliant-light-effects/', 'Sebastiano']);" target="_blank"><em>Sebastiano</em></a>.

The <a href="http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments/flame" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments/flame', 'Flame Painter']);" >Flame Painter</a> is a java enabled online application which enables the user to create visuals using flames. The purpose behind creating this interface was to ensure that everyone can be an artist. The tool is easy to understand with a few basic features common to most illustration oriented software.Apart from setting the HSB, there are other features such as noise, focus, opacity, chaos and most importantly eraser. After creating your artwork, the unique feature which distinguishes this application from the others created by <a href="http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments.html', 'Blaskovic']);" >Blaskovic</a>, is that it can be saved. The saved image opens up a new tab from where you can download it your computer.

The other options apart from the Flame Painter include the Fluid Painter, Pixel Animator as well as online games such as The Others and Fluidz. For me though, Flame Painter steals the show. Itâ€™s a visual treat and an excellent stress buster. It is actually quite addictive.

Let me know what you guys think about it and drop in any similar online tools you know about through your comments.
