Google made it clear to the world that it cares for user security and privacy, by introducing <a title=" Secure Google Search: Now use Https While Searching" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/secure-google-search-now-use-https-while-searching/" target="_blank">SSL version of its search engine</a> yesterday. It  will prevent third parties from intercepting search terms and search results, as a result of the encrypted connection. Currently it is in its beta stage, but one can still make full use of it by using **https** every-time you perform a search on **Google**.

And if you are feeling a bit lazy, you can follow the steps below, to make Google SSL as your default search engine on Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer. With this, every time you perform a search through browser search box, it will be encrypted. Here we go:

### **Firefox**

**1.** Download and install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3682/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3682/', 'Add To Search Bar']);" title="Add To Search Bar"  target="_blank">Add To Search Bar</a> addon, and restart your firefox.

**2.** Head over to <a href="https://www.google.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com', 'https://www.google.com']);" title="Google Secure Search"  target="_blank">https://www.google.com</a>. Right-click anywhere on the search box and click on **Add to search bar**&#8230; in the menu.
