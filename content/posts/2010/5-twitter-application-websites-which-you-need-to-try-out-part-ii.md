As a succeeding article to that I have prepared a new list of Twitter(web 2.0) application websites Which You Should Try part-II. Presently around 100 Million tweets and 700 Tweets updating per every second Twitter is considered to be at its best and is in a stage that is raising the doubt that it may cross Google some day (traffic).

From past 2 years it has been one of the few websites whose graph is seeking up and up as the day passes. Its present Alexa rank is 12. Which may be the reason that few services are just concentrating on the Twitter Applications.
