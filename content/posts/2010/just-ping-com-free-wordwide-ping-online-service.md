Here comes, one of our tools of trade! üòâ

In many of our services, specially &#8211; <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/', 'Blogger To WordPress Migration Service']);" >Blogger To WordPress Migration Service</a>, we move domains from a server to another server at times. In this migration process, most crucial phase in change in DNS records.

Time taken to reflect changes in DNS records varies from few hours to few days. It depends on many things like domain registrar, physical location of nameservers, your ISP caching, local system caches and many other things.

All above factors. makes it hard to check to trust local ping command which will only reflect a domains information **at your end.**

To overcome these problems, we use** **a free web-based service &#8211; **<a href="http://just-ping.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://just-ping.com/', 'just-ping.com']);" >just-ping.com</a>**

### What if domain doesn&#8217;t resolve as expected at your end?

It may happen that, even if just-ping shows desired results world-wide, site may not be working as expected on your end.

**Possible reasons for this can be:**

  1. Local DNS cache &#8211; Flushing DNS cache on machine may help
  2. Network cache &#8211; if your machine is in corporate network, behind firewall or proxy, then network elements may have their own local caches
  3. ISP cache &#8211; some ISP maintains their own cache. In this case using something like [OpenDNS][2] or [Google DNS][3] may help.
