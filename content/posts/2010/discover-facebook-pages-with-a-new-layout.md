excerpt: Being a weekend I was just going through some movie pages on Facebook and thought how great it would be if I could see all the favourite things on one page. Well after a bit searching I found page that had everything I wanted to see. :)

Being a weekend I was just going through some <a href="http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/movie-reviews-on-rotten-tomatoes-get-facebook-touch/', 'movie']);" >movie</a> pages on **Facebook** and thought how great it would be if I could see all the favourite things on one page. Well after a bit searching I found page that had everything I wanted to see. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Facebook has recently come up with a new **<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/browser.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/browser.php', 'Page Browser']);" >Page Browser</a>** that has all the pages according to your friend&#8217;s likes and dislikes. You can go through it and see which page you want to open.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/discover-facebook-pages-with-a-new-layout/pages/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/discover-facebook-pages-with-a-new-layout/pages/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2829"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-54572" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/pages.png" alt="" width="965" height="312" /></a>

It also contains how many friends have similar likes.

According to <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=429987037130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=429987037130', 'Facebook Blog']);" >Facebook Blog</a>, developers will continue to evolve the Facebook page as they get the feedback from Facebook users. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Facebook sure knows how to keep its users busy and happy. What do you think do share with me through your comments.
