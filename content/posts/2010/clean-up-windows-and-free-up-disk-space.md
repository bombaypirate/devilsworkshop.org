Here is an application which helps you clean up your Windows Operation system and keep it in top shape. **nCleaner** is perfect if you want to customize things like advanced system and advanced application cleaning system.

The** nCleaner** website makes claims that it end up tweaking and cleaning up to **2GB** space on the hard disk due to using its features like memory management, System resource monitor, Tweak manager along with a System Adviser. I liked the huge number of options and applications it supported and worked with seamlessly. It offers the casual Windows user something along with a lot of customizable options for someone with some advanced knowledge of Windows.

### About nCleaner

  * **nCleaner** is meant for Windows XP, Vista and 2003. I installed it for Windows 7 and it did work fine.
  * It has support of over 100 applications typically used with Windows and hence allows you to clean up registry.
  * It cleans up disk space significantly especially if you have a Vista or XP with too many applications.
  * It allowed to shred free disk space on hard disk which frees up space but also does not allow recovery of files that were deleted before.

If you are using **Windows XP** or **Vista** I think it will be quite a useful tip to clean up the registry along with managing system resources in a more comprehensive way. Let me know if it has helped you out and drop in your comments with your opinions.
