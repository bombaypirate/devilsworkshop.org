Redesign season has really caught Google as earlier last month it re-designed parts of Gmail with changes in icons and also new contact cards being revamped. Google Docs has be redesigned quite a few times and Gmail over two months as seen its share of [new features with drag and drop attachment][1].

**Google News** has recently been redesigned and most of it is not very visible or apparent. But the one thing that stands out is how you can now share news very easily.

As seen in the image above Google News links can be shared across most social networks. Personally I like using Google News as it really sorts the new out for me and also has a local emphasis on the content that is filtered in. This new redesign is not available for people outside US, but if you change the content to US centric this new format is available.

**Google News **seems to be a much under utilized tool from Google if compared to other services Google provides.
