How many of you missed file transfer feature in Gtalk when they moved from [Yahoo messenger][1] to [Google talk][2]. This is one such feature which I always wanted to have in my [Google talk ][3]application and after this <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2010/03/file-transfer-in-igoogle-and-orkut-chat.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2010/03/file-transfer-in-igoogle-and-orkut-chat.html', 'update from Google team']);" >update from Google team</a> :

> *Starting today, you can share photos, documents, and other files while chatting in **iGoogle** and *<a href="http://www.orkutdiary.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkutdiary.com/', 'orkut']);" >orkut</a>* **.  To give it a try, just click **Send a file…** in the **Actions** menu while chatting with a friend (no download required)*

This news come as a surprise to me and this is good news for all the users who are fan of [Gmail][5] and it’s services. Gmail chat already integrated Video chat sometime back and enabling file transfer will make it more feature rich and I believe this will fetch them more users from their counter part IM.

*I will love to know your reaction for this new feature from Gmail chat team?*
