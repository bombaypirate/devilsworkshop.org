Familiar icons on your desktop play a very important role. They are visual aids for you to not waste too much time and get work done faster. Just imagine if you had 20 folders and the &#8216;My Computer&#8217; shortcut was also present and all had the same icons on the desktop. You would probably at least waste up-to 2-3 seconds every time you wanted to open a particular shortcut.

Icons with their shortcuts usually save us time. It might seem insignificant but I reckon that for every 2 hours on the computer you probably end up saving up to 3-5 minutes. The time saving aspect is even more prominent for someone multitasking.

This can be quite relevant to your website/ blog as icons or images often help your regular readers to get oriented. I came across this neat website which helps you create and customize some icons and then download them for your personal use.

### About <a href="http://iconizer.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iconizer.net', 'Iconizer']);" >Iconizer</a>

  * **Iconizer** allowed create customized and stylized icons. Even though there are many website which might have a lot many more icons to choose from but this website allows you make changes to the original icon you have chosen.
  * I could change the foreground and background color of the icon image.
  * I could also select its width and height in pixel units.
  * **Iconizer** also has the option of you generating the icon image in **GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP and ICO**.

I have once previously reviewed a [internet service which helps you create customized favicons][1] but I liked Iconizer as I think it allows me a lot more versatility.

Go ahead and look up **<a href="http://iconizer.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iconizer.net', 'Iconizer']);" >Iconizer</a>** and let me know if you liked playing around and generating new icons for your desktop or even your website to give it just that extra sense of familiar feel.
