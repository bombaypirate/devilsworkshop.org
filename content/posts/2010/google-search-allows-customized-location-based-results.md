Google does have a great knack for making their search features better by the day. There have been quite a few improvements or new features like Google Instant. But most times a great product is not about radical features but simple ones which become great because of its functionality.

This morning I checked on Google of some movies I wanted to catch at a cinema hall. Earlier the results showed up location-based which was usually taken from the** IP address**. This was fine but suddenly it a pop-up in the left side of the browser asked for me to confirm my location with a postal code.

While [Bing is tying up with Facebook to create social search][1], Google is doing something different to make search results more local and customized.

Mostly innovations and features like these really gain the confidence of people. It gives me the chance to customize my search rather having customized preset search features.

This new features should help out a lot more with Google Maps as being used as the first choice of listing when it comes to finding places and reviews of those places. Also location-based feature will be very useful to be used on mobile phones. Something a lot of people do not take seriously.

What do you think about the new Location based search features from Google? Do drop in your comments.
