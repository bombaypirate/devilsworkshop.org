## **#1. Domain Name**

One thing professional bloggers would love to get is a domain name, but make sure that the domain name is something out of the box and brilliant. Don’t just buy a domain name for just the sake of it. Go to a trusted site and buy a worthy domain.

## **#2. Hosting provider**

If your fellow blogger is not on a professional hosting site then there is no better way to gift him than this. Get the best hosting for him from popular providers like HOSTGATOR , BLUE HOST etc…

## **#3. Provide your services**

****If you are a professional programmer/webdesigner  then you might even gift them your service to help them build a better designed blog. Build them a good page, logo which would increase the beauty of their blog.

## **#4. Link their site**

If you are a blogger too then you can link their site and send some good amount of traffic. Create a banner for your fellow blogger in the sidebar. He would be very pleased to see that and surely he would be double happy with the gift.

## **#5. Gadgets**

Most bloggers when they are away from desktops and internet they start looking really sad ! so you may also opt to buy them some cool gadgets . Even a 3G enabled phone would let them be connected to blogging always as will a laptop or netbook.

## **#6. Pro Accounts **

If you are aware of sites like Flickr and all then you would know that to take the full advantage of them ,  you need a pro account. So why not help them get one? Get them a pro-account from flickr , picnik
