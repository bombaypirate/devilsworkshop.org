One thing we all have are too many files with some sort of importance. The other problem is we do not always use a single computer. Take my example I usually end up working with 3 different computers from 3 different locations. This makes it important to collaborate files which you might want at all times. One handy method is using [Drop Box to collaborate all files across systems][1].

I find <a href="https://finalfolder.com/welcome" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://finalfolder.com/welcome', 'Final Folder']);" ><strong>Final Folder</strong></a> quite useful as there is not application to install like Dropbox and it works great as a online folder to save files as archives with your email address.

  * **Final Folder** requires you to register with your email address. Your email address also is then your username for looking Final Folder and the files you have archived within.
  * So if you have a file you want to archive and save for reference all you have to do is send an email with the files attached to **keep@finalfolder.com** from your registered email address.
  * This email address works even if it is entered in CC or BCC field.
  * This is very useful while cleaning up my **Inbox** of all those funny pictures and images and powerpoint presentations sent to my by my friends. I do not have to save them on my email **Inbox** but can archive or back them up on **Final Folder**. ðŸ˜‰

Final folder is not exactly like **DropBox** or other [similar services to save and sync files on cloud ][2]but is more relevant as a archive folder which can be saved online. Do try out <a href="https://finalfolder.com/welcome" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://finalfolder.com/welcome', 'Final Folder']);" ><strong>Final Folder</strong></a> and let me know your views and opinions through your comments.
