Google Maps is an awesome tool. Anyone who has tried to look up a new address and get to it, often use Google Maps. This tool is awesome because most times all you really need to search for is the exact address and Google Maps shows where it is exactly.

As you can see in the image below all someone has to do is send you an email to your Gmail account. Gmail will show a Google Map of that address automatically.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-26345" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-has-now-google-maps-integration/google_maps_gmail/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26345" title="google_maps_Gmail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/06/google_maps_Gmail.png" alt="" width="522" height="517" /></a>

This is possible on your Gmail by enabling Google Maps preview in mail by looking up &#8216;Labs&#8217; under &#8216;Settings&#8217; in Gmail.

This is a great way to integrate **Google Maps** with Gmail. The addresses are accurate in the United States and not made available internationally. Google is planning to make it available for all international addresses to show a corresponding Google Map. I wonder if **Bing Maps** will go the same way with its [new planned changes with Hotmail][1].
