Facebook goes down again! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There are some new additions being made, and it has gone down.

Facebook&#8217;s Photo album is now a slide show. Wow. They had made these changes few months back and rolled out the feature to US but now its in my profile also.

Facebook has made a major change in pages.

This is huge and this is nice. I love it when Facebook makes changes and leaves us all to try and see whats good and bad with it. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Anyways I hope Facebook gets back on track as soon as possible!

[Update] The downtime lasted for 45 minutes and it was knowingly done by Facebook engineers as some<a href="http://facebook-working-on-4-new-features" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://facebook-working-on-4-new-features']);" > new features were seen on the profile pages of Facebook users.</a> It was all by mistake.
