Recently our editor Aditya posted about <a title="Link to Facebook sending page reports to admins" rel="bookmark" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2010/03/18/facebook-sending-page-reports-to-admins/">Facebook sending page reports to admins</a> and now they have started showing posts insights with every single posts for you pages. That means now you can get stats for every single posts you publish which can be a status update, a link, video or even a single image you share.

If you admin a page then post something and you will see &#8220;Post Insights not yet available, please check back later.&#8221; line attached with your post and after some time it will start showing the total number of impressions and a percentage feedback. Here number of impressions is the number of clicks on that posts by it&#8217;s fans and percent feedback is the total number of interactions i.e comments and likes as compared to the other posts of that page. By percentage feedback we can judge the quality of particular content.

Obviously this feature is very useful for those who have genuine pages for their business to track the user&#8217;s need but this feature isn&#8217;t available for every page right now. Hopefully they will launch it completely soon. What do you think about this new feature? Tell us, drop a comment below.
