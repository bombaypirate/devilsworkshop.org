Do you find yourself searching through folder after folder to find a particular file you are working on? You may have many folders on your computer and this can make it tricky to remember exactly where the item you want is located.

Even if you know exactly where a folder is, it can be frustrating to find through the same levels of folders over and over to get to the file you want. So it becomes irritating to browse folder or file which is often needed. To access those file quickly we can create a shortcut on the browser.

To do so we just have to simply download and install a Mozilla extension which integrates with the browser and provides quick access to the file or folder.

To get it to your browser window go in ’view menu –> toolbar –> shortcut toolbar’.

And you can see in the above image we have a toolbar just below the navigation bar.We can create a new file and folder shortcut by just clicking on the extreme left icon of the toolbar, browse the folder and we are done with a shortcut.

## More about this Addon
