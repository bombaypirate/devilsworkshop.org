Recently Google has started a page to let Orkut users look up what is new with their services. Obviously one can follow the official Orkut Blog but most users might want to just look up a single page and check if they missed anything. As you all know that Orkut does not change a lot of things. Definitely they do not change things around every day for us but once every few days.

You can now look up what is new with Orkut by visiting <a href="http://www.orkut.com/whatsnew" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.com/whatsnew', 'http://orkut.com/whatsnew']);" ><strong>http://orkut.com/whatsnew</strong></a>.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="http://orkutdiary.com/help/how-to-check-whats-new-with-orkut/attachment/orkut_whatsnew/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdiary.com/help/how-to-check-whats-new-with-orkut/attachment/orkut_whatsnew/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-687"><img class="aligncenter size-full  wp-image-53885" style="border: 1px solid grey" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/orkut_whatsnew.png" alt="" width="550" height="270" /></a>
</p>

This is probably showing Google&#8217;s intention of leveraging Orkut a little bit as many Orkut users might be using Orkut but not know its integration with <a href="http://orkutdiary.com/tools/get-orkut-updates-on-chrome-video/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdiary.com/tools/get-orkut-updates-on-chrome-video/', 'Google Chrome']);" title="Google Chrome">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="http://orkutdiary.com/features/orkut-shows-off-photo-sharing-with-a-video/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdiary.com/features/orkut-shows-off-photo-sharing-with-a-video/', 'Picassa']);" title="Picassa">Picassa</a>.

You can visit that page for the latest from Orkut or you can always leave it to Orkut Diary to write about the latest happenings on Okrut. ðŸ˜‰
