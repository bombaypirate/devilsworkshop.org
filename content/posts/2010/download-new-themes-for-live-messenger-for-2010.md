A lot of blogs, websites and services introduce new themes, designs and offer freebies usually around festive times like Christmas and New Year. I often use **MSN Messenger** which Microsoft has rechristened **Live Messenger** more than a year ago. Its quite handy and at times I [even use it as a Twitter client][1]. ðŸ˜‰
