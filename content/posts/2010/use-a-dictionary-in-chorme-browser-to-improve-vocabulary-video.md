If you love to blog or write you might like to sit with a dictionary even though it is quite impractical. Not just so that you avoid spelling mistakes but also get the exact context of a word you come across. Many of us might not have English as our first language of choice and this can be a bit of a problem when articulating exactly what you want.

The dictionary can be added through an extension in the Chrome browser and I am quite enjoying it. While writing this post I have already used it in twice and hence decided to record the video on how I can use different words or improve my choice of words using this extension.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18913" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="use_dictionary_browser" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/01/use_dictionary_browser.png" alt="use_dictionary_browser" width="300" height="255" />

An example is the word &#8216;articulating&#8217; that I used before. It was not my first choice of word and I was planning to write &#8216;explaining&#8217;. But while reviewing part of the post I tested the extension. (See video at the end of the post)

  * A simple double click gets the dictionary started.
  * It has options to look up related information from dictionary.com, Wikipedia and much more.
  * Ironically when I added [Google Dictionary][1] it seemed not compatible with the extension.
  * It is quite easy to use with a popup appearing of your the dictionary after double clicking on any word of the text your are reading.

What do you think? Will it help you improve your writing or even vocabulary? Or will you find it interesting just for a quick reference of a word you came across but were not sure about it&#8217;s meaning. Let me know through your comments.
