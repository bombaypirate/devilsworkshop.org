    You must have observed the advertisements that keep popping on your Wall while working on Facebook. I usually get distracted by them and do not like them at all. I was searching out ways to overcome this and I found a script that works if you have Mozilla Firefoz and Greasemonkey.

You must have observed the **advertisements** that keep popping on your **Wall** while working on **Facebook**. I usually get distracted by them and do not like them at all. I was searching out ways to overcome this and I found a script that works, if you have **Mozilla Firefoz** and **Greasemonkey**.

## What will script do?

  * Remove right hand side column that gives ads
  * Feed column is extended
  * Facebook Chat window becomes partly transparent

In short you will get a **cleaner Wall**. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### How to install ?

  * Install **<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/', 'Greasemonkey']);" >Greasemonkey</a>** (Greasemonkey is a Mozilla Firefox add-on that allows users to install scripts that make on-the-fly changes to HTML web page content).
  * Go to <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/80793" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/80793', 'Minimalist Facebook']);" >Minimalist Facebook</a>.
  * Install.

Once you have installed all the above you will see advertisement free wall. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

#### **How to remove the script?**

  * Go to tools
  * Select Greasemonkey
  * Click on Manage user scripts
  * Select remove <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> or you can just disable Greasemonkey.

If you know any other way of doing this do share it with me through your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
