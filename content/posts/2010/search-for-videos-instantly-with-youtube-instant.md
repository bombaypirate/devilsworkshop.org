    Google created a real buzz when it rolled out Google Instant. This led to SEO experts wondering how it will affect the SEO business along with some wondering if search patterns will change with new Google Instant.
    
    After that was done, a student by the name Feross Aboukhadijeh from Standford, CA took a bet with his friend and decided to create an Instant search engine for YouTube videos in less than an hour! He lost the bet as it took him 3 hours but we do have a nifty search tool for YouTube. ;-)

## About <a href="http://ytinstant.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ytinstant.com/', 'YouTube Instant']);" >YouTube Instant</a>

  * The website shows off videos in the format of instant results as you start typing in a query.
  * This can be very useful if you are just randomly searching for something and trying to land on a useful video.
  * The site is probably experimental and only a few days old. So it does not have any advanced features. But after the buzz it has created I am sure this site might go a long way.

This website also made the <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/w4arc" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.quoteurl.com/w4arc', 'CEO of YouTube offer job on Twitter to the website&#8217;s creator']);" >CEO of YouTube offer job on Twitter to the website&#8217;s creator</a>. ðŸ˜‰ I guess Google Instant has got its first instant web celebrity.

Do try out <a href="http://ytinstant.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ytinstant.com/', 'YouTube Instant']);" >YouTube Instant</a> and let me know your views and opinion on it through your comments.
