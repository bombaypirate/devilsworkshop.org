Coupe of days back Pakistan banned Facebook because few people created a page by the name of “Everybody Draw Mohammed Day” and users were uploading images of Prophet Mohammad which is not allowed in Islam.

Seems like Facebook is not the end of this internet censorship in Pakistan. Users reported that almost 450 sites including Twitter, Youtube, Wikipedia are banned in Pakistan.

As communicated by Pakistan telecommunication authority (PTA) “YouTube had been blocked due to “sacrilegious contents”. Though it’s not clear which particular content, but YouTube is blocked at this moment in Pakistan.

*Seems like internet censorship in Pakistan is going to be worse than we imagined. If you are from Pakistan, do let us know which major sites are blocked and your reaction about blocking of major social networking sites?*
