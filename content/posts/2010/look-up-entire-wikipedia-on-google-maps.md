I hardly have met anyone who uses the internet but does not use <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wikipedia.org', 'Wikipedia']);" >Wikipedia</a>. Even school kids are now a days wiki something they learn at school. There is one thing we do get in Wikipedia and that is a huge number of locations. From names of countries to small villages are all used while writing article on Wikipedia. There is website which has started a great experiment and that is mix Wikipedia article with <a href="http://google.com/maps" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com/maps', 'Google Maps']);" >Google Maps</a>. The end result is you can literally look up the entire **Wikipedia** on **Google Maps**.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18737" style="border: 1px solid grey" title="Wikipedia_google_maps" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/01/Wikipedia_google_maps.png" alt="Wikipedia_google_maps" width="550" height="221" />

As you can see in the image above I decided to wiki** Adsense**. Wikipedia article shows up to the left of the page with relevant locations being shown to the right side which is actually a Google Map. I clicked on the tag it shows text from the wiki article itself. The text shown with Google maps is also highlighted in the Wikipedia article.

This is an excellent way to mix two services which are often used for research by people. One of my favorite searches on <a href="http://maps.thefullwiki.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://maps.thefullwiki.org', 'The Full Wiki']);" ><strong>The Full Wiki</strong></a> is searching for famous personalities like Columbus, Alexander or Napoleon who obviously traveled a lot and all of it is usually available on Wikipedia articles. It is quite a great way to pass time reading up these articles with the aid of Google Maps showing exactly where incidents happened.

*Below is a video demo of The Full Wiki*



Know of any better ways to use this service? Do drop in your comments. ðŸ˜‰
