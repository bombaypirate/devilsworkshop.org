**Snag It** has been a favorite among bloggers for taking screen shots. One problem with Snag-It is when you take screen-shots of aÂ  Window which is semi-trasnparent with rounded corners thanks to Aero; the results are not as good as you might want them to be. I came across 7Capture a screen capture software which deals with semi-transparent windows with rounded corners in a much more appreciable way.

Here is an image below of the same window screen-shot taken with Snag-It and 7Capture.

### About <a href="http://www.7capture.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.7capture.com/', '7 Capture']);" >7 Capture</a>

  * You can download **7Capture** from<a href="http://www.7capture.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.7capture.com/', ' here']);" > here</a>.
  * It works fine with Windows 7, Vista and XP. It is meant only for Windows platform. It us mainly useful for rounded corners and neutralizing transparency in a Window. So I don&#8217;t think it is much use of people without Aero features.
  * I compared 7Captrue with Snag It for the corners; 7Capture is not a great image editing tool which Snag-It surely is. Snag-It is a paid software which 7Capture is not; so comparison is unfair.
  * The one thing I did not like with 7Capture is it has absolutely no editing features. Which means after you save the file on your computer; you end up using the image with another editor.

Try it out of you want to takes screen-shots which are almost as good as they can be seen on your desktop; let me know what you think about **7Capture**.
