Here I have this Image for our tutorial. Now we are going to cut out this person&#8217;s  image from the full image.

  * First of all go to **Tool bar **and select the **Pen Tool**.
  * Right click on it and you can see this tool palate.

  * When you select Pen Tool you can see **Pen Tool** properties at the top.
  * Select the **Paths **option for getting paths on the image. (see image below)

  * Select around the Object Image using the **Pen Tool** as shown in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30100" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-cut-object-image-from-the-picture-with-photoshop/img-4/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30100" title="img-4" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-4.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="515" /></a>

  * Selection should go around image object we want to cut out as shown in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30101" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-cut-object-image-from-the-picture-with-photoshop/img-5/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30101" title="img-5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-5-600x511.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="511" /></a>

  * When we complete image selection just press **Ctrl+Enter** to join the two points of the selection.
  * Now we have selected the background image here to be cut out.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30102" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-cut-object-image-from-the-picture-with-photoshop/img-6/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30102" title="img-6" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/img-6-600x506.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="506" /></a>

  * Here I have taken **Feather Radius value &#8211; 1 pixel**. This is basically to make the image soft.

  * After selecting feather Radius Value, delete the selected image part.

Here is the final image.
