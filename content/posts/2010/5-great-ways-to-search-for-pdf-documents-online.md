[Ruchi][1] wrote a nice post a few days ago detailing [10 websites to download free E-books][2]. It got me think and looking up other ways to search for PDF files online. E-books are fine but there are also many online forms, documents, pamphlets all in PDF format which someone might be interested in look up.

Here are some tips and websites to search for **PDF** files online.

### **#1. Search for PDF files with Google Search**

  * You can search for PDF files using Google. It searches the web for files with extension being PDF rather than links.
  * For example when you want to search for PDF files regarding CSS just type in **&#8220;CSS filetype:pdf&#8221; **without the quotes into the search bar.
  * This will make Google pull up relevant PDF files on CSS. ðŸ˜‰

</p>

### ****#2. Search for PDF files with Bing****

  * What works with Google also works with Bing search engine.
  * To have Bing search for only PDF files need to write the keyword first and then file type has to be defined.
  * I searched for PDF files on CSS with this query **&#8220;CSS Filetype:pdf&#8221; **without the quotes.

### **#3. <a href="http://www.pdf-search-engine.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pdf-search-engine.com/', 'PDF Search Engine']);" >PDF Search Engine</a>**

  * [PDF Search Engine is a website][3] which has been covered before on DW.
  * It allowed me to search for only PDF files online. No fancy filetypes had to be defined as this website only searches for files which are in PDF format. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a rel="attachment wp-att-24364" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/5-great-ways-to-search-for-pdf-documents-online/search_tips_pdf_pdfsearch/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24364" title="Search_tips_PDF_pdfsearch" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/Search_tips_PDF_pdfsearch.png" alt="" width="372" height="83" /></a>

### **#4. <a href="http://www.pdfgeni.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pdfgeni.com/', 'Search PDF Geni']);" >Search PDF Geni</a>**

  * Search PDF also looks up a decent list of PDF files with any keyword. It is pretty similar to PDF search Engine.
  * The only downside is that it supports multiple languages and sometimes with keywords like &#8220;CSS&#8221; it can give you results which are not necessarily in your language.

</p>

### **#5. Search PDF files on Yahoo Search**

  * Just like we can search for only PDF files with Google and Bing, I could also search for PDF files with Yahoo Search.
  * With Yahoo the example to use for the query is **&#8220;CSS originurlextension:pdf&#8221;** without the quotes.
