Flickr is one of the most popular picture sharing website. You get millions of pictures according to your requirement. You can choose the images by specific category, tags, license etc. But sometimes keywords are not enough, we prefer to choose the picture according to the colors. This is especially for the people who are very choosy towards blending picture colors properly with the layout of blog or for their personal use.

There is a very useful tool for all color conscious people called “<a href="http://labs.ideeinc.com/multicolr/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://labs.ideeinc.com/multicolr/', 'Multicolr Search Lab']);" >Multicolr Search Lab</a>”. Multicolr Search Lab helps you to search images based on colors.

You need to select the color from the color palette chart and you will get the images relevant to that color. As soon as you choose the colors the search result will refresh the page with pictures/ images which match with the color you choose.

You can even choose different colors, up to 10 colors to find pictures.
