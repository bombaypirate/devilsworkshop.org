You Tube is a service which was wholly reliant on hi-speed internet connectivity. You Tube started about five years ago when most western countries had broadband easily available. Now hi-speed internet access is readily available around the globe and that has seen You Tube grow exponentially.

But what about your ISP? How fast do videos stream on your browser thanks to your ISP. I sure would like to compare the speed and see where I stand regarding other Internet Service Providers around.

You Tube has a tool called My Speed which actually allows you to check and compare speed of You Tube videos streaming on your connection.

  * When I used it on my computer it showed Video Speed comparison in the last month. Here my ISP is way below what is average speed for Pune (city where I reside), India and Global speed.
  * It is useful to note that most time click on a Video and wait till it gets completely stream. While doing so I surf around and check websites. This be slowing down the video streaming speed and I might not get an accurate picture.
  * I was out of town for a few days in the time it checked for speed variation and my ISP had changed along with City so this might have also had its effect.

So try out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/my_speed" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/my_speed', 'You Tube Video Speed History']);" >You Tube Video Speed History</a> for yourself and compare the speed at with You Tube is streamed over your Internet connection.
