<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22754" style="margin: 0px 15px;" title="world_map_01" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/world_map_01.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="179" />These days, we all are talking about [Internet speed][1] in India. I am sure that once in every gathering of minimum of 2 friends, they talk about it and discuss where are we (India) lacking, who is offering what speed and at what prices, etc.

We talk, because we see some hope & scope of improvement to speed up our work, communication and entertainment with the use of Internet. We (at least me) feels ashamed when I had told my Internet speed Vs money I pay, to my friends abroad!

It is frustrating when &#8216;connection times out&#8217; while you&#8217;re purchasing online, booking tickets, meeting people, [video chatting][2] with families abroad, uploading large files, grabbing knowledge from [video][3] tutorial and so on&#8230;  
(And I did not mention playing multi-player [games online ][4]here because we simply cannot do it in our bandwidth. )

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-22755" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="bored" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/04/bored.jpg" alt="" width="118" height="118" />I can go and have cup of coffee or smoke a cigarette or have a phone call to friends if  I am downloading or uploading heavy files! Because I cannot / should not do anything on the computer fearing that  connection may get interrupted if I browse or my computer may hang in between then I will have to re-start the whole process!

As we talk and wait (and only wait) for [3G launch in India][5] &#8211; Where we stand on Global Internet map &#8211;  is not pleasing at all.

Here are few details which I obtained from speedtest.net. You can also check your internet speed on this site.  
** Listed as Rank > Country > Download speed**

**1.  Republic of Korea &#8211; 22.49 Mb/s  
2.  Aland Islands &#8211;  18.87 Mb/s  
3.  Latvia &#8211; 17.92 Mb/s  
4.  Japan &#8211;  16.94 Mb/s  
5.  Romania &#8211; 16.17 Mb/s  
12. Hong Kong &#8211; 11.57 Mb/s  
16. Germany &#8211; 9.58 Mb/s  
24. Singapore &#8211;  8.32 Mb/s  
25. France &#8211; 8.07 Mb/s  
28. United States &#8211; 7.60 Mb/s  
123. Srilanka &#8211; 1.49 Mb/s  
****127.India &#8211; 1.45 Mb/s**

** This information is excluding tests done with connections used by Colleges and Corporations.*

**We stand way below at 127th with an average speed of 1.45 Mb/s** with a hope to get somewhere within Top 50 countries.

If we look at some [][6][Broadband Plans][7] on offer from various ISPs. The most noticing thing about these plans are, speed in &#8216;KB&#8217;s & cost in &#8216;K&#8217;s. It still feels like a luxury to have a faster Internet connection. 8mbps, 24mbps, 30mbps, [50mbps][8] &#8211; these kind of numbers are only creating a buzz but nothing beyond it.

While the world is moving fast, moving heavy, getting  more HD &#8211; How are we going to catch up with them?

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">I would really appreciate if ISPs provide minimum of 1 MBps & 2 Mbps unlimited plans in current prices of 256 kbps & 512 kbps <a title="unlimited plans" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/what-does-unlimited-broadband-really-mean/">unlimited plans</a> (not exceeding Rs. 1750/month with taxes) with almost zero downtime &#8211; I think this should be enough for now and would be a good stepping stone to tell other countries that yes, we&#8217;re coming!</span>

I would really appreciate to know your view on this.
