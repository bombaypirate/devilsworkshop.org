Can someone view my contact info whom I do not know, I was worried about my profile privacy. Then I asked my friend for his ID and password so that I can check how my profile looks to him.

To view your info how it looks to others no need to do this you can directly preview your profile, nobody else&#8217;s password is required. Just enter the name of any of your friend, you will be able to watch the preview how it looks to him.

## Steps to view your profile preview:

Go in the **Account **> **Privacy ** **Settings **(the below page appears > Select **View Settings.**
