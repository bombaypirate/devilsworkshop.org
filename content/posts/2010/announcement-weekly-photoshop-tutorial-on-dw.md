<a rel="attachment wp-att-33222" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/announcement-weekly-photoshop-tutorial-on-dw/photoshop-300x300/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-33222" title="photoshop-300x300" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/photoshop-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>In the past couple of months we have published quite a few basic [Photoshop tutorials][1] which really got a very good response. This was mainly thanks to Umesh Katkar who is a web designer at rtCamp. He is not a full time blogger and that led to post frequency being slightly erratic.

But now we have decided to announce a weekly article on Devils&#8217; Workshop. So from tomorrow onwards, every Tuesday we will publish a Photoshop tutorial. Do not forget to [subscribe to DW Feed][2].

Our main contributors to these weekly tutorials will be [Umesh Katkar][3], [Huzaifa Darbar][4] and Sneha Mutha. A big thank you to them for making this possible.
