Google has <a href="http://googlesocialweb.blogspot.com/2010/09/google-url-shortener-gets-website.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlesocialweb.blogspot.com/2010/09/google-url-shortener-gets-website.html', 'launched a new portal for its URL Shortener service']);" >launched a new portal for its URL Shortener service</a>. This service was previously only available with Google toolbars and other services like Feedburner. There are some spin-off by 3rd parties which have [browser extensions and bookmarklets][1] for the short URL service.

<a href="http://goo.gl" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://goo.gl', 'Goo.gl']);" >Goo.gl</a> website is now active and allows you to create short URLs.

## Features of <a href="http://goo.gl" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://goo.gl', 'Google URL Shortening website']);" >Google URL Shortening website</a>

  * I liked the simple layout. Just enter the URL and create the short URL. The threadbare nature of Goo.gl made me think of Google getting back to its roots. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * Statistics for all the short URL you create can be tracked for how many people click on it.
  * Beyond that it also gives details like browser used, place and other details about people clicking on the shortened URL.
  * Considering it is Google, I believe that it will be a lot safer and secure. Google also plans to tackle spam with the same technology that is used to keep spam out of Gmail.

### What next for Goo.gl?

Google has announced that it will soon release a API for **Google short URLs**. This will obviously make it more useful to be used with 3rd party applications.

Google might be working on a new social network or rather a social layer which it wants to include across its services. If its true then a short URL service with tracking tools just might be a good start.

Do you think <a href="http://bit.ly" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly', 'bit.ly']);" >bit.ly</a> and other URL shortening services have anything to fear from Google? I think they have a lot to fear from Google URL shortening service a year down from today.
