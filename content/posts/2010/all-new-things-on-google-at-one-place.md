  Google is a very large company and they have more than a few products and services which people are interested in. I personally was more interested in Google Search and Gmail. Slowly I became a fan of Google Earth, Google Reader, Google Analytics etc. Get the picture? Because I blog about tech the next logical step was to subscribe to all the blogs which Google runs for its services.
  Google New products is a page which shows exactly whats new that Google is churning out.

<a href="http://www.google.com/newproducts/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/newproducts/', 'Google New products']);" >Google New products</a> is a page which shows exactly what&#8217;s new, that Google is churning out.

If you are keen on following Google and its various dedicated Twitter account you might want to read [follow everything Google does on Twitter][1].

Wondering about all the blogs that Google keeps to give information about its various services? You can look that up at this <a href="http://www.google.com/press/blogs/directory.html#tab0" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/press/blogs/directory.html#tab0', 'blog directory']);" >blog directory</a>.

I see that **Google **makes looking up information for its services a lot more easier than any other internet company does. For instance try searching for the actually landing page to download Internet Explorer 9 beta version or even search for what is new with **Yahoo **or **Bing**.
