Looks like Facebook has finally listened to the most popular demand of Facebook page admins- the option for editing page title!

The most common problem a page admin faced till now was the inability to change the title of their Facebook page. This meant that one has to be extra careful while typing in their page name during registration. One small spelling mistake and you are stuck with that name for ever. Other than creating a new page you had no second choice.

But not anymore!!

Today Facebook has rolled out the option to edit your page title. It is being done in phases, so it may take a while before you see this option. It is possible that Facebook is now testing this feature and so has added this option to limited pages only. When I checked for my blogs’ Facebook pages, I found that one Facebook page had the option enabled, while other didn’t had that option yet. See it for yourself:

### How To Edit The Page Name

  1. Click on Edit Page in the left side of Facebook Page <img style="float: none;margin: 10px auto;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/FacebookPageBlogspotKnolEdit.jpg" border="0" alt="Facebook Page Blogspot Knol Edit" width="304" height="278" />
  2. Click on Basic Information. You’ll see the option of editing the page name if it has been enabled for you.[<img style="float: none;margin: 10px auto;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/FacebookPageBlogspotKnolChangeName_thumb1.jpg" border="0" alt="Facebook Page Blogspot Knol Change Name" width="504" height="160" />][4]

### Few Questions That You May Have

  1. Can I change the name just once?  
    No you can change the name as many times as you want <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  2. Will the followers who joined my page through old name get a notification regarding the change?  
    The followers won’t get any notification about the change. The page name that is displayed on their profile will automatically change to the new one.

This is definitely a welcome move by Facebook.

I hope Facebook will read our list of <a href="http://fbknol.com/7-things-i-hate-about-facebook-pages/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/7-things-i-hate-about-facebook-pages/', '7 Things We Hate About Facebook Pages']);" >7 Things We Hate About Facebook Pages</a> and provide solution to the remaining six too.

So what do you think about this move from Facebook ? Have you got this new feature enabled yet ?
