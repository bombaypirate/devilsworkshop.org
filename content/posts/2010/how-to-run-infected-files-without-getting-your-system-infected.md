Yes it&#8217;s true that you can run infected files on your system without getting the system infected. <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sandboxie.com/', 'Sandboxie']);" >Sandboxie</a> is an Application that allows you to do so. This is useful in circumstances where you have a USB device or installing a not so known file on your computer. **Sandboxie **can help you install the program even if it is infected without getting your system affected.

### Here is a quick demonstration

  1. I have downloaded a infected file. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  
    <img class="alignnone" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/infected-file-alert-from-kaspersky.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="135" />
  2. Kaspersky prompts me that the file is infected.
  3. Thankfully I have Sandboxie on installed on my computer. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  4. Now run the file. You have to navigate to the folder that has the file which is infected.
  5. Right Click on the file and then Click &#8220;Run Sandboxed&#8221; from the drop down menu.

Just a few points of some note. **Sandboxie **is not a Anti-Virus software and having an updated antivirus program is still the best way to keep your system safe.

Do try out Sandboxie and drop in your comments.
