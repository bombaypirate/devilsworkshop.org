After launching nearly 7 <a title="Opera 10.50 beta" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/opera-10-50-beta-2-for-windows-released/" target="_blank">release candidates</a> for its Windows web browser, Opera released Opera 10.50 final today, that claims to be the **[fastest browser][1] in the world**. We almost lost the count on the number of release candidates, when Opera came out with 4 release candidates yesterday!

Testing its speed, fixing various bugs and optimizing the browser for windows environment were all a part of updates that were made in various Beta updates, so as to make user experience smooth.

Giving a new shape to **User Interface**, the whole look and feel of the browser has been improved. For windows 7 users, the Aero glass, Aero peak and Jump list support makes it look the best! The much needed feature, **Private browsing** as well as private Tabs feature has been introduced and that enables users to hide their activities on web.

The major improvement came in the form of **New [Javascript][2] Engine** &#8211; **Carakan**, that makes the browsing fastest. **HTML5** for video support and **supports CSS3** for enhanced effects are also some of the featured improvements.

The launch comes at a crucial time when European users of windows OS will be having a choice to choose their browsers, as Microsoft rolled out **Browser Ballot screen** for the European Union users of windows OS yesterday.

The browser will soon be available for Linux and Mac users. For windows users, it is available for download in nearly 42 languages.

So what do you think about **Opera&#8217;s** claim to be the fastest browser in the world?
