The most trending privacy feature now days is to hide your profile pictures from unknown people or even from your friends. But let me clear one thing here is that you can only lock the profile picture album, your current profile will still be shown to everyone. To hide your profile pictures, simply follow the following procedure:

  1. Login to your facebook account and go to Account >> Privacy Settings. (see top right side of your profile). You can also simply <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy', 'click here']);" target="_blank">click here</a> to go to privacy settings.<img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-50931" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/07/privacy-1.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="530" />
  2. Now click on customize settings link on that page.
  3. Click on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos', 'Edit album privacy ']);" >Edit album privacy </a>to view the privacy level for all your albums. (link: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos', 'http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos']);" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=photos</a> ).
  4. Now the first album will be your &#8216;Profile Pictures&#8217;. For that album select &#8220;Custom&#8221; option from the drop down list with the album.

That&#8217;s it, you&#8217;re all done now as there&#8217;s no need to save these changes. Go back to your homepage and your profile pictures album will now be locked for everyone even if the person is in your friend&#8217;s list.
