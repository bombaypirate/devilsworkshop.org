Pakistanis has launched much controversial Facebook rival Millatfacebook.com two days back. Pakistan government has banned Facebook due to a controversial draw of Prophet Mohammed. This site is known as Millat Facebook and aims to appeal all Muslims to raise the voice against social networking giant Facebook.

Last month Facebook failed to remove Prophet Mohammed&#8217;s image from the Facebook in the time which agitated many Muslims all over the world. The ban will be reviewed on 31st May 2010 which is highly unlikely to get lifted. Millat Facebook looks like a replica of Facebook and believed to be offering Facebook like features(?). From the front page you can easily make out that they are targeting Facebook. It is also a good news for many Pakistani people as they can connect to their friends using the new social networking website.<figure id="attachment_1641" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
