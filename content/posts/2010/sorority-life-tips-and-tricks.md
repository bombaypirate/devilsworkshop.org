Facebook&#8217;s Sorority Life is a very popular game.Created by playdom in 2008, the multi-player game now has more than 5 million users.

Sorority Life is a game in which players(generally girls) form their sorority . Players earn points by asking other Sorority sisters to join their house (Sorority), work at a job, socializing and take on rivals in fights that increase their bank balance. Players can use their “brownie points” to purchase dresses,accessories, outfits and glam .

Here&#8217;s some small things to remember while playing Sorority Life (playdom)  
if you have been playing SL you would understand what I mean when I say don&#8217;t waste your BPs. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (brownie points)  
because they take time to collect.

  * Please don&#8217;t go for stupid playdom schemes that say you can earn &#8216;bp&#8217; fast,they don&#8217;t work.

  * You can create 2-3 characters in which you can shift while playing and hide(because if you have attacked a player from your bigger level character when she comes to attack you back,she can&#8217;t attack you as you are in a level much smaller than her) by creating characters you can earn brownie points fast. because once you level up (like i am in 145 level) it becomes hard to earn bp or finish games fast

  * Do not forget to install playdom tool bar,it gives you some thing everyday(hair/brownie point/money etc ) .You can even earn 100 BP <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  * Try to be updated with the job because once you start lagging behind in jobs the money keeps on getting deducted without you even knowing it

  * Try to pamper your sweetheart at a particular time each day,to prevent it from getting stolen and if you can share it with some one,great stealing increases the charm and popularity of the SH a good maxed out SH can give you great gifts once they leave.
