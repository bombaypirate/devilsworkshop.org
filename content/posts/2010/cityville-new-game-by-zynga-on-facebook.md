Zynga, the makers of Farmville is launching a new game, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#!/pages/CityVille/168232079864416" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#!/pages/CityVille/168232079864416', 'CityVille']);" >CityVille</a>. Â People have to make their cities and have fun with it. The new thing here is that this new game is being launched internationally that is it is launched in 5 languages (English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish).

This<a href="http://www.cityville.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cityville.com/', ' will be available in Beta version now']);" > will be available in Beta version now</a>, and improvements will be made based on the bugs etc. Although this game is not released, yet 16,865+ people have already liked it. Players will be allowed to build structures, roads, schools, start business and moreover they will be able to export and import the stuffs from other cities. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This is a good way to learn commerce what say?

With this new game they are hoping to gain the top position again. Well, I cannot be sure for that because some time ago there was another game released by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SocialCity?v=info" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/SocialCity?v=info', 'Playdom named Social City']);" >Playdom named Social City</a>. It did break some records and gained popularity but very soon just extinguished. How different is this new game than the last one? Lets see how it turns out ?
