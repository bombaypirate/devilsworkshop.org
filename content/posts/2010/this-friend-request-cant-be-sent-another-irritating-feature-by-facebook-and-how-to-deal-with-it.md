Most of the people are on Facebook to make new friends, and I am one of them who loves to send request to random people on facebook.com. But this thing isn&#8217;t gonna possible anymore cuz of a new feature to prevent the misuse of Facebook. Obviously this is a good feature specially for those who gets hundreds of useless friend requests every week. But trust me, this feature won&#8217;t let you to get connected even with even those whom you know personally. Check out the few reasons why Facebook won&#8217;t allow you to send friend request.

**No Mutual Friends:** If you are trying to send a request to a person who doesn&#8217;t have any friend in common with you, then that could be an impossible thing from now on Facebook. As in that case Facebook assumes that you are randomly adding that person.

**Send too many Friend Requests?** Yes, if you send many friend requests to everyone who&#8217;s profile seems interesting üòâ then Facebook won&#8217;t let you send a request to new profiles even if you know them. You will get the same error message asking that, &#8220;Do you know this user personally?&#8221;

**Too many rejected Friend Requests:** Again you cannot send more friend requests if there are many users who declined your friend request.

### ERROR MESSAGE:

<img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-51465" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/frnd-rqst.jpg" alt="This Friend Request Can‚Äôt Be Sent" width="467" height="151" />

This Request Can&#8217;t Be Sent  
Do you know this user personally? To prevent misuse of Facebook, this request can&#8217;t be sent. To learn more, please visit the Help Center. If you believe you&#8217;re seeing this message in error, you can report the problem.

### POSSIBLE SOLUTION:

If you are getting such type of messages even if you are sending request to the right person i.e whom you know personally then you have to report an error to Facebook. Click on &#8216;report the problem&#8217; on the popup screen (see the image above). Select option &#8216;Yes&#8217; and give appropriate reason in comments. They will review your request and you have to wait until your request gets reviewed. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### UPDATES:

  1. Even you can&#8217;t send request to those people, who are appearing in your friend suggestions. What&#8217;s the use of suggestions then? üòõ¬† *[updated-August 16th 2010]*
