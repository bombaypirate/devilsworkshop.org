This has been one of the most requested feature by Facebook users and finally Facebook has added a like button for commentators on any post. Now you can simply click on like on any comments added by any oen status update and this way you can easily fin popular comments into any one status update. Specially for bloggers and webmasters this is pretty useful, as they can quickly see what people are voting for.<figure id="attachment_1845" style="width: 355px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

One thing which I still missing is Facebook unlike button, specially for comments which doesn&#8217;t make sense. At this moment we see Flag button, but unlike button will add more features to rating system of comments on Facebook. But I&#8217;m still very happy with the integration of like button in comments.

Also when some one will hit on like button on your comments, you will get notified, so get ready for more status notification and spend more time on Facebook. According to<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=399440987130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=399440987130', ' official blog announcement']);" > official blog announcement</a>

> So like peanut butter and jelly, we realized these two features would go better together. Starting today, most of you will see a small &#8220;Like&#8221; button appear underneath comments. We&#8217;re rolling this out gradually, so if you don&#8217;t see the new button yet you will soon.

> Whether it&#8217;s a witty remark, a great point in a discussion or a helpful answer to someone&#8217;s question, clicking the &#8220;Like&#8221; button within comments now makes it simple to show your appreciation for all types of content on Facebook.

*Do let us know your feedback and review about this like button on Facebook comments?*
