Do you play games on Facebook? If you do, then you must be aware of the game requests shift, recently. To cut the clutter and make it more clear all the game invites and requests were shifted to the left hand side where the applications are being displayed. But that reduced the amount of players on Facebook.

Due to this, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/430" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/430', 'Facebook developers have come up with a plan']);" >Facebook developers have come up with a plan</a>. Now on the right hand side there will be text messages telling about the game requests. According to Facebook, the requests were more clickable when they were placed on the right hand side.

[<img class="wp-image-54212" style="margin: 5px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/game-requests_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="game-requests" width="554" height="249" />][1]

Now when a new game request arrives, you can see a text alert on the right and the counter of game requests will increase on the left hand side. When you click on the alerts you will get a pop up sending you to the original position of the game requests. Clicking on the alerts will result into nothing. Some users may get frustrated because nothing opens when you click that alert. Facebook will now allow <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph', 'Open Graph objects']);" >Open Graph objects</a> with less than 10,000 Likes to have their type changed without resetting their Like count.

Hope you all will not be confused on seeing this new feature of Facebook. If you notice any other changes do share it with me through your comments.
