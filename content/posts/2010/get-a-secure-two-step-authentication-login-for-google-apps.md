When a user tries to login to an account he will be asked to enter an another key provided to him along with the usual user name and password. There is always a need for more secure login and what else can be better? <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  * Activate the option feature from the settings page(this will be available to certain Google Apps customers first).
  * Type the username and password.
  * Enter the **verification code.**

The verification code can be obtained by your mobile phone. Google has built a &#8216;**Google Authentication**&#8216; application for certain mobiles only that is Android, iPhone, Blackberry. You need to link the mobile phone with your Google Account and start the application. It will give you a six digit verification code which you can enter on the screen that was asking you the verification code. The verification code can be sent to you by SMS or voice call also. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This may take a couple of minutes and you get a secured log in with less chances of getting the account hacked or used for the wrong reasons. So anybody who wants to receive a code should be able to get it. The SMS and voice call alert option should be able to work on all kind of phones.

This is currently available only with Google Apps accounts.
