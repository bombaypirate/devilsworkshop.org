*This is a guest post by Tushar, if you like to write for Devils&#8217; Workshop, do read*[* Devils&#8217; Workshop revenue sharing program*][1]*.*

We all know about free Linux based <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/finally-a-google-operating-system/" target="_blank">operating systems</a>, free open-source office and graphics <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/category/softwares/" target="_blank">softwares</a>, and so on! Open-source softwares are future of computing software! No doubt!  But open-source does not only mean Free. It also means for better quality, higher reliability, flexibility, lower cost, reviewing & contributing to the development process!

Few days back I came across this new OS called <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reactos.org/en/index.html', 'ReactOS']);" target="_blank"><strong>ReactOS</strong></a>. This OS is based on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/hacking-windows-nt-5x-ie-windows-2000xp2003/" target="_blank">Windows NT</a> architecture. Which means that you can install your existing Windows device drivers & softwares on this OS. I have followed it up since then. Recently when I checked, I found that the development has come a long way since I first saw. And I thought of sharing with you.

I am specifically writing this post to let all software <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/category/developers/" target="_blank">developers</a> know about it and take part in this project development if they can.

It happens so many times & we hate Windows for frequently annoying us. Sometimes a developer may feel like doing something about it, but one can not (unless works for MS). So if you&#8217;re a software developer then you too can contribute for development of this OS. <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/dev_start.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reactos.org/en/dev_start.html', 'Click here to  know more.

**What is this ReactOS?**  
According to <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reactos.org/en/index.html', 'ReactOS website']);" target="_blank">ReactOS website</a>, ReactOS® is an effort to create a Free Software replacement for Microsoft Windows® that is compatible with existing hardware and software! ReactOS is a free and open-source operating system based on the Windows NT architecture, providing support for existing applications and drivers, and an alternative to the current dominant consumer and server operating systems.

I first downloaded the ReactOS Live CD to preview prior to the installation. But somehow I could not preview completely as few areas are yet to be implemented in a live cd version. You may download <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/reactos/ReactOS-0.3.11-REL-live.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://downloads.sourceforge.net/reactos/ReactOS-0.3.11-REL-live.zip', 'ReactOs Live cd here']);" target="_blank">ReactOs Live cd here</a>.

As of now the ReactOS seems very lightweight and fast! Installation ISO which I downloaded is only 46.5 MB in size. I was surprised. Final release size may vary as the project develops. You can download <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/reactos/ReactOS-0.3.11-REL-iso.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://downloads.sourceforge.net/reactos/ReactOS-0.3.11-REL-iso.zip', 'installation  ISO of ReactOs here']);" target="_blank">installation ISO of ReactOs here</a>.

I installed ReactOS through VirtualBox. I purposely avoided installing it on my current hardware so that I do not disturb any ongoing projects, just in case anything goes wrong! Unfortunately because of this, I could not install any device driver nor any Windows software I am using.

Installation was quick. **The installation process and post installation user interface look very similar to Windows.** It also offers multiple desktops as we see in <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/a-multi-touch-gestures-in-ubuntu-least-some-of-em/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> or <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fedoraproject.org/', 'Fedora']);" target="_blank">Fedora</a>.  **ReactOS definitely needs more robust development** to be able to reach to the practicality benchmarks & improvements set by popular open-source operating systems we know.

ReactOS website has plenty of screen-shots to show you. <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/screenshots.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reactos.org/en/screenshots.html', 'See  them here']);" target="_blank">See them here</a>

Below is a video of screen-shots to show you how it looked at my end!  


According to me, this is a great beginning of something that I never thought will ever exist. I would really like to use this OS if it works great, but let&#8217;s wait for some more time until they say ReactOS is ready for daily use.

**Please Note:**

  * ReactOS is in development stage now and** is not suitable for daily use!**
  * My suggestion to developers is, if you find it interesting & worthy then take your time and contribute to the project at your best. Who know, what happens next! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
