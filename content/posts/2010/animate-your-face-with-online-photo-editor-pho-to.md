I had been to this website just a couple of days ago. Today, I noticed  a feature in <a href="http://pho.to" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pho.to', 'pho.to']);" target="_blank">pho.to</a> which can make emoticons of our own face by detecting each part of your face. Do you Have a pic with the best background, but your face with no smile?  Then <a href="http://cartoon.pho.to" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cartoon.pho.to', 'pho.to cartoon']);" target="_blank">pho.to cartoon</a> is what you have been hunting for.

## How to turn a weeping pic to a smiling one?

  * Visit <a href="http://cartoon.pho.to" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cartoon.pho.to', 'cartoon.pho.to']);" target="_blank">cartoon.pho.to</a> and upload an image you want to animate. Then select the type of emoticon, wink or smile.
  * Check **Animate** if you want it as a **.gif** file or keep it unchecked if you want it to be a still image with the effect in action.
  * Set the photo size of your choice and then **Apply**.
  * You can use this website without the need to register but if you do register you can save your photos online where as if you are not registered the photos are deleted after 12 hours.

      There are other features like <a href="http://editor.pho.to" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://editor.pho.to', 'Photo editor']);" target="_blank">Photo editor</a>, <a href="http://enhance.pho.to" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://enhance.pho.to', 'Photo enhancer']);" target="_blank">Photo enhancer</a> and more in the pho.to website. But only pho.to&#8217;s cartoon made me write an article about it.
