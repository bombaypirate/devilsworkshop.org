Here is a website which allows you to create vertical and horizontal menus without the need of any knowledge of a coding. This tool should be really useful for someone who is tweaking around on his theme for a blog but is hampered by lack of knowledge of coding.

  Recently we have been writing a lot of posts which will help developers including information on <a title="How to include Paypal " href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-include-paypal-buy-now-button-on-your-website/">How to include Paypal &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button on a website</a> or on <a href="Retweet, F Share & Google Buzz buttons on your Blog without plugins.">how to have Retweet, F Share & Google Buzz buttons on your Blog without plugins</a>. But these do need a working knowledge of HTML language. This is where websites like Menubuilder.me is very useful.

  * It has a display which shows exactly how the Menu will show up.
  * I could tweak the background of default and mouse-over for a particular button. I could also select a Menu style.
  * After I choose a horizontal or vertical menu I could then generate and Preview it. On the other hand I could download the generated menu as a zip file.
