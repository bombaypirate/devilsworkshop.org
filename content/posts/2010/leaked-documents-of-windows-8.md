Whenever Apple product is going to launch in Market, there are always rumors fake or leaked images before its launch and now it same goes with Microsoft.

Recently <a href="http://msftkitchen.com/2010/06/windows-8-plans-leaked-numerous-details-revealed.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://msftkitchen.com/2010/06/windows-8-plans-leaked-numerous-details-revealed.html', 'Microsoft Kitchen']);" >Microsoft Kitchen</a> blog has leaked few images and documents of Windows 8 which are watermarked as “Microsoft Confidential- released to <Derek.Goode@hp.com>”. The images also give a brief about the features of Windows 8.

**Here are few features of Windows 8 according to leaked images:**

  * Face recognition technique
  * Touch Display
  * Includes Kinnet-like features
  * Automatic shutdown as soon as you move away from your system
  * Easily switch between users, as soon as new user comes in front of camera
  * Supports USB 3 and Bluetooth 3
  * Connect Windows account to Cloud

It seems Microsoft making itself ready for getting into competition with Apple, because the images are titled as “How Apple does it: A virtuous cycle”. But I guess, Microsoft has to cross long distance to get in competition with Apple OS.

**Check out the following leaked images of Windows 8:**

There is no official announcement from Microsoft that these slides are real nor there is any mention about release date of Windows 8, so until Microsoft don’t announce officially about Windows 8 features and images, enjoy the rumor.
