As a blogger who writes about Tech, I end up visiting a lot of websites which might or might not be safe. How do I come across these website? Usually I come across them by doing some research, thanks to Google our friendly search engine.

To make sure I do not click on a link to a site which is not trustworthy I use **Web Of Trusts** (WOT) addon or extensions depending on the browser you use.

### **About <a href="http://www.mywot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mywot.com/', 'Web of Trust']);" >Web of Trust</a>**

  * Web of Trust actually has scanned millions of websites and allows us simple warning about the sites trustworthiness thanks to an add-on of extension.
  * It shows the green Web of Trust symbol as show in the above image whenever Google lists out search results.
  * Individual sites also can be scanned as and when you visit them. The best way to really check out how WOT rates them before visiting the website is to search for that URL through Google. ðŸ˜‰

**Web of Trust** is supported across Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome and works on Mac, Windows and Linux. For someone like me who is online and browsing literally many hours everyday Web of Trust along with [Privacy Choice which is an Firefox Add-on to keep a tab on which websites track my usage statistics][1] is a big boon.

Do look it up and let me know if you find it useful.

**Install Web of Trust: **<a href="http://www.mywot.com/en/download/ie" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mywot.com/en/download/ie', 'Internet Explorer']);" >Internet Explorer</a> | <a href="http://www.mywot.com/en/download/&url=ff" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mywot.com/en/download/&url=ff', 'Firefox']);" >Firefox</a> | <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp', 'Chrome Browser']);" >Chrome Browser</a>
