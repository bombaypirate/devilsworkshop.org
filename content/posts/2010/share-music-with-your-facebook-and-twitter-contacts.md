Working online can mean people like me can end up spending anywhere from 8-10 hours online everyday as a minimum. But being online does not mean I do not have some for of recreation as someone said &#8216;All work and not play makes Jack a dull boy&#8217;. Here work would be blogging and Jack would be me. There is one thing that I love doing is sharing music and videos and interesting links with friends on **Facebook** and **Twitter**.

Here I came across **Feeder fm** which a online service which just about plays any song you search for and allows you to share it with your **Twitter** and **Facebook** contacts.

### About <a href="http://feeder.fm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://feeder.fm', 'Feeder fm']);" >Feeder fm</a>

  * I could sign-in using my **Facebook** credentials. Then all I had to do was look up music with the search box.
  * I could search with Artist Name or Song Name. When you click on a result you can play it and then share it online with your **Facebook** and **Twitter** contacts.
  * Then from a list select which friend you want to share the song with and click on Feed. (see image below)

So now I can share a song I like with a friend from **Facebook** or **Twitter**. This is quite a lot of fun and I guess my friends can expect a lot of musical content from me. ðŸ˜›
