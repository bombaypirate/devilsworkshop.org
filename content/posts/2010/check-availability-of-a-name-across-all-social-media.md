The internet is a fish market. No one really owns anything and that is actually true even for something as unique as your name or nickname. Social Media or social networking websites have burst out in numbers. **NameChk **is a great website. I could check my nameâ€™s availability on various social networks within seconds.

  * Just enter your name or the name of your blog and let the website check for availability of the name across 50 social networks.
  * This is very useful when launching a new service. For instance I am launching a new service or blog and want a particular name across social networks to represent the brand. NameChk can be very useful creating if all the major social networks you want has that name available.
  * There is no need to login or register for using this service. ðŸ˜‰
