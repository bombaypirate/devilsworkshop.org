What&#8217;s your homepage? Google? Well, now it can be changed to Facebook. Yes, I got this update on my Facebook account today.

Facebook is prompting a message at the upper side of my Facebook profile saying that &#8220;Drag this to your home button to see what&#8217;s happening with friends as soon as you open your browser.&#8221; Some photographs of my friends is also being displayed along with the message. I just have to drag that button to my home and make Facebook as the homepage.

A recent study has shown that people tend to click that page more which is their landing page. Just like Google gets a lot of clicks as it&#8217;s the starting page for many. If Facebook becomes home page then that surely will get more clicks any how. Now that every 1 click out of 10 in U.S. is Facebook, I wonder what the next stats are going to be. When a person will see Facebook as the first thing, he surely will do it more. Your landing page matters a lot, just see how any online tool when downloaded asks you to make its website as your home page. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

This is a sharp move being made by Mark Zuckerberg and I am sure this will increase their fan following a lot. This feature is now in the testing phase, not everyone has been prompted for it.So what are you going to do? Will you let FacebookÂ  rule your world, even more?
