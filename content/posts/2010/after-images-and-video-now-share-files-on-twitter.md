  I am sure you are aware of the many Twitter applications and services which allow you to share links, photos and even videos. We have already reviewed how you can organize and share Twitter links or even the other way round about how you can share tweet links from You Tube to Twitter.
  
  But what about files? Sharing files through Twitter can be quite handy as I might want to exchange certain text files with my followers rather than have it on a website and then share the link.

I am sure you are aware of the many Twitter applications and services which allow you to share links, photos and even videos. We have already reviewed how you can [organize and share Twitter links][1] or even the other way round about how you can share [tweet links from You Tube to Twitter][2].

But what about files? Sharing files through Twitter can be quite handy as I might want to exchange certain text files with my followers rather than have it on a website and then share the link.

  * **Sign in** with your **Twitter** account and type in your message along with attaching the file by uploading it.
  * The file size limit is** 50 MB **which I think is so for server efficiency. It seems quite useful for sharing freebies with your tweet followers.
  * There is a **File Social** **desktop app** and also a phone app which you can check out at their website. The phone app is available on **Android**.
  * After sharing the file with my Twitter followers, they can simply click on the link and **download** the **file**.

I think this not really a great service for bloggers or internet marketeers who are looking to increase their traffic but I think it would be a awesome way to release some freebies that your company or website might offer. ðŸ˜‰

Let me know what you think about it through your comments.
