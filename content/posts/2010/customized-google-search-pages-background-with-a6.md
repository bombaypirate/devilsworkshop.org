Recently I wrote about how [Google is introducing customized images][1] which can be included as backgrounds which can replace the white plain background of the Google search page. This will pretty much make Google resemble Bing search but I think such customization to Google was long overdue.

Atleast one website thought so and has already brought many skins which can be used as the background image for your Google search homepage.

### **About <a href="http://www.a6.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.a6.com', 'A6.com']);" >A6.com</a>**

  * It was easy to just visit the page and look through many galleries with awesome photographs as background with the Google search bar in the middle of it. Type in your search query and results show up without the background image.
  * The background you actually like can also be saved as your homepage on the browser you are using.
  * Unlike the new Google feature this will not need signing into your Google account at all. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If you liked reading this post you might like reading about [adding background image to excel][2] and [adding background image to a pen drive][3].

So do try out<a href="http://www.A6.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.A6.com', ' A6.com']);" > A6.com</a> and their themes and let me know what you thought about these customized backgrounds.
