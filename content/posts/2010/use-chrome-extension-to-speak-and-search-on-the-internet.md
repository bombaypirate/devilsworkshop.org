  <strong>Voice search</strong> is a Google Chrome extension that provides a method to search by speaking. NowadaysÂ  most of the smart phones have the ability to accept voice commands and perform actions and this experimental add-on will allow us to search by speaking out the words we want to search on the internet.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34780" title="simple" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/simple.png" alt="" width="400" height="275" />This is a really amazing add-on and goes on to show the capabilities built into Google Chrome.
</p>

**How to use it:**

  * If you want to search for &#8220;cats&#8221; just click on the microphone and say &#8220;cats&#8221;. If you want pictures of cat say &#8220;google images cats&#8221;.

**Features and requirements:**

It comes preloaded with the following services :

  * Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Wolfram|Alpha.
  * We can also add our own custom search engines.
  * It also integrates a speech input button for all websites using HTML5 search boxes like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Github.
  * Requires a microphone.

</p>

**Drawback:**

  * Speech input is experimental and hence speech recognition is not perfect.
