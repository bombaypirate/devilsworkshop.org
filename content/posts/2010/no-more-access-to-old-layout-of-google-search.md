Few days back [Google changed its old layout][1] to make search more easy and user-friendly. But Google fans find some or other way out to use Old layout of Google, which we shared with you. You just need to use a link, to [get the old layout of Google Search][2].

But the people who used to prefer to use the old layout of Google Search, wonâ€™t able to access this link anymore to get old Google Layout. Many Google fans are disappointed with this step of Google but I guess Google want to maintain the uniformity.
