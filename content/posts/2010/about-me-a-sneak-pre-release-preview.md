Few days back, a team of nine people designed a site for themselves. They found it tough pulling all social/online accounts and sites to a page. So they created <a href="http://about.me/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://about.me/', 'about.me']);" >about.me</a>, a site to show off one in all online profile.

Later-on they decided to make it public. At present, public registrations are locked and its by invite only.

  * Drag and Drop Administrator interface.
