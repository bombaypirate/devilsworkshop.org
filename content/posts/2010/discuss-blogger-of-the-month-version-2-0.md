Blogger of the month was something we had [discontinued temporarily early in January][1] this year but we had promised to bring it back on DW. This is a contest open for all our guest bloggers. Previously the system was simple. A prize money of $100 was given to the blogger of the month.

Yes **Blogger of the Month** will be back very very soon! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Earlier we had simple statistics to decide on who wins Blogger of the Month contest for that month. We also then allowed it across all our <a href="http://rtblogs.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com', 'rtBlogs network']);" >rtBlogs network</a>.

We thought now that we are coming out with Blogger of the Month version 2.0 it would be a great idea to take opinions and suggestions from our readers on what they would like to see with this contest and how to make it bigger.

### **Some points for you to consider:**

  * Should there be one prize or many prizes? For many months we had a $100 dollar prize but then later we did have a prize for the top three ranked authors.
  * Do you want the Blogger of the Month award on per blog or across blog network. Our blog network called rtBlogs has [Devils&#8217; Workshop][2], <a href="http://wpveda.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpveda.com', 'wpVeda']);" >wpVeda</a>, <a href="http://fbknol.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com', 'Fbknol']);" >Fbknol</a>, <a href="http://orkutdiary.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://orkutdiary.com', 'Orkut Diary']);" >Orkut Diary</a> and <a href="http://crictalks.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://crictalks.com', 'CricTalks']);" >CricTalks</a>. Do you want the author to be ranked number one across the blog networked as No. 1 or on particular blog?
  * How do you want the rating system. Earlier we had a every post rated on English and Presentation along with the context of the post. This was important as news like post got lesser weight overall. Do you have any better ideas?
  * Earlier if you wrote the scored for all the posts written were added and that was the score on which authors were ranked. Do you have any alternative ideas?

The point of this post is we want ideas and a discussion around what you would want to see with **Blogger of the Month version 2.0**.Â  So start dropping in your comments with your ideas and we will try to incorporate all of them.
