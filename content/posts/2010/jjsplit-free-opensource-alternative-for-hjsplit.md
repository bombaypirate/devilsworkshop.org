I&#8217;ve been using Linux for some months and was searching through the synaptic Package Manager and cannot find an equivalent Utility to **HJ Split**. The Linux version of HJ Split was not very effective and I went through many forums and posts. Got some results but not really satisfied!

I wondered if I&#8217;m just not using the right search parameters?

So, I tried randomly by replacing &#8216;H&#8217; with &#8216;J&#8217; in HJ Split as in for example I have entered JJ Split and hit the search button.

I found a software that is named <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jjsplit/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sourceforge.net/projects/jjsplit/', 'JJ Split']);" >JJ Split</a>.

### **What does it do?**

  * A file splitter made in java to split and join files very quickly for easier transfer over the internet.
  * It has the option to delete parts one by one while joining/splitting.
  * Supports joining .001, .002 parts as well. Just double click to join the files..&#8221;
  * I was pleasantly surprised and stunned in its speed and performance. It guess it is surely be few times faster than any other software like  HJ Split.
