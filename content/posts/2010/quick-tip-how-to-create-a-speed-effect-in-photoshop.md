<a rel="attachment wp-att-30039" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-10/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30039" title="image-10" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-10-600x226.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="226" /></a>

In this tutorial we will see how to create the Speed EffectÂ with using Motion Blur Filter. The image is two parts where the motorcycle has been overlapped on the background.

**#1. First take the Images**

For this tutorial we need image of car or bike and another one should be on any road or any natural settings.

I decided to go with the image below. ðŸ˜‰

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30043" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-01-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30043" title="image-01" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-012.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="294" /></a>

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30043" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-01-3/"></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-30044" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-02-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30044" title="image-02" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-021.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>

**#2.Cut out the Bike Image**

Cut out the bike image. You can cut it with the **Pen **tool.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30046" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-03-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30046" title="image-03" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-031.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="295" /></a>

Now the image looks like the one below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30047" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-03-3/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30047" title="image-03" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-03.png" alt="" width="500" height="294" /></a>

**#3.Drag the Bike Image**

Now open the second image.Â Then drag the Bike Image on Road image. This way we have two images in the file.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30048" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-05/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30048" title="image-05" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>

**#4.Here we go for our Speed Effect**

Now lets go for our **Speed Effect. **Select the Layer of Road picture image and go to **Filter> Blur> Motion Blur**.

Now you can see this palate. Keep your Angle Value -34, Distance 10px for this one and click OK.

You are free to change Angle Value and also Distance value as per your picture&#8217;s specifications. At the end of it we get a effect like in the image below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30049" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-06/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30049" title="image-06" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-06-600x403.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="363" /></a> <a rel="attachment wp-att-30050" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-11/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30050" title="image-11" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-11.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>

Then select the Bike image layer and go to **Filter> Blur> Motion Blur** keep Angle value -34, Distance 4px, after that make the selection around the wheels of Bike and go to **Filter> Blur> Radial Blur** keep your Amount value &#8211; 8, Blur Method &#8211; Spin, Quality â€“ Good. Click OK. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30051" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/untitled-12/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30051" title="Untitled-12" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/Untitled-12.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="375" /></a> <a rel="attachment wp-att-30052" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-08/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30052" title="image-08" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-08-600x363.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="363" /></a>

Here we have got our **Speed Effect **with simply 2-3 steps. Itâ€™s take hardly took me ten minutes.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-30053" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/quick-tip-how-to-create-a-speed-effect-in-photoshop/image-09/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30053" title="image-09" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/09/image-09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>
