### Why should you install SwitchHosts to Firefox?

By installing SwitchHost, you don&#8217;t need to edit the host file manually, which is present in `/etc/hosts` (in ubuntu system) and for Windows `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

**Example : **By using Switchhost, you don&#8217;t need to add an extra line &#8211; *216.239.32.21 example.com* to the **hosts** file to switch the host from *127.0.0.1* (localhost).

### How to use SwitchHost ?

  2. Search for &#8216;SwitchHosts&#8217; and install it to Firefox, and restart it.
  3. Now, go to the SwitchHosts Menu which can be found in the &#8216;Tools&#8217; Menu and click on &#8216;Before you start(click)&#8217; option.
