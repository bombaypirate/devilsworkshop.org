It gets worse if you want to share a link, and almost like a 'tweeting' time bomb you can see the character limit reducing - 3, 2, 1, 0! Short URLs are obviously the lifeline of Twitter and websites like Bit.ly sure makes life easy. What if you want to share say 10 links with your friends? Bit.ly Bundles a new service can be quite useful."

Twitter&#8217;s 140 character limit has made life so difficult for us, chatterboxes! It gets worse if you want to share a link, and almost like a &#8216;tweeting&#8217; time bomb you can see the character limit reducing &#8211; 3, 2, 1, 0! Short URLs are obviously the lifeline of Twitter and websites like <a href="http://bit.ly/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly/', 'Bit.ly']);" target="_blank"><strong>Bit.ly</strong></a> sure makes life easy. What if you want to share say 10 links with your friends? <a href="http://bit.ly/bundles/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly/bundles/', 'Bit.ly Bundles']);" target="_blank"><strong>Bit.ly Bundles</strong></a> a new service can be quite useful.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32344" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/bit-ly-bundles-group-togeather-multiple-websites/bit_ly_logo/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32344" title="bit_ly_logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/bit_ly_logo.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="310" /></a>

With bundles, you can group several links together, name it and obtain one common URL. Grouping links not only gives you the option to share multiple sites but also gives your friends the choice of viewing whichever site they want.

## How <a href="http://bit.ly/bundles/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly/bundles/', 'Bit.ly Bundles']);" target="_blank">Bit.ly Bundles</a> works:

  * To begin with, I had to create an account with Bit.ly.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32341" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/bit-ly-bundles-group-togeather-multiple-websites/bit_ly_bundles_account-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32341" title="Bit_ly_bundles_account" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Bit_ly_bundles_account1.png" alt="" width="350" height="405" /></a>

  * Now enter the links of the URLs you want to group together and click on &#8220;Bundle&#8221;. I wanted to group all the 5 blogs in our <a href="http://rtblogs.com/blog-list/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtblogs.com/blog-list/', 'rtBlogs network']);" >rtBlogs network</a> together.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-32306" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/bit-ly-bundles-group-togeather-multiple-websites/bit_ly_bundles_links-2/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32306" title="Bit_ly_bundles_links" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/Bit_ly_bundles_links1.png" alt="" width="500" height="387" /></a>

  * Now you can choose a name for the group you have created and write taglines for individual links you&#8217;ve added.
  * After clicking on the &#8216;Share&#8217; icon on the side panel, the URL is generated.

As simple as that. I found this new featureÂ intuitively functional and useful. I also like the fact that you can describe the links, and name the group.If you like this feature you might be interesting in reading about [BridgeURL which is a similar service][1].
