Today, Bharti Airtel agreed to sell Apple&#8217;s iPhone 3GS in India in the coming months. Airtel is India&#8217;s largest mobile phone operator by users.<!--more--> Yesterday, it had also submitted its bid to participate in a bandwidth auction for 3G services, and the successful bidders would be allowed to offer 3G services on commercial basis from September 1, 2010.

We had also covered [this story in June 2009][1], but the deal has happened now and it looks like only Airtel would be selling iPhone 3GS in India.
