*Code Barrel* was first designed for their own development purpose that data can be stored, shared and re-used. It provides functionality like tagging, advanced search copy paste etc. It can also keep track of snippet revision, supports commenting, email notification is sent when snippet is changed. It will assist developers to boost up their work-flow.

*Code Barrel* is a global and secure central repository or online storage for storing code snippets for re-usability. *Code Barrel* is a hosted solution, so no need to download client, install or update. It is a perfect solution for software development companies and workgroups.

It supports most of the programming language. It is specifically designed to store and share code snippets among the team that makes developer speed up with their code. Visual Studio is a free code barrel plug-in that can easily be used. An Eclipse plug-in is under development and will be available soon.
