If you have recently in the past few hours logged in to your Google Reader you might have noticed a link to **Google Reader Play**. This is a concept where you can look up random and interesting articles on Google Reader with a very different and interesting layout. The layout of reader does not change and **Reader Play** is a totally different landing page. One playing around a bit with it, there is one website which surely must have started feeling a bit jittery.

That website would be **Stumble Upon**. Take a look at the image below and do not be mistaken. It is the layout for configuring the web pages you come across with **Google Reader Play**.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-21653" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-reader-tyring-to-take-on-stumble-upon/google_reader_plus/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21653" title="Choose Categories with Google Reader plus" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/Google_reader_plus.png" alt="" width="320" height="440" /></a>

### Google Reader Plus

  * Visit <a href="http://google.com/reader/play" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://google.com/reader/play', 'http://google.com/reader/play']);" >http://google.com/reader/play</a> for using **Google Reader Plus**.
  * Unlike Reader you do not necessarily have to sign-in to view random and interesting web pages.
  * The format is unique as in your do not see the entire page but just images and a bit of text and link to the page.
  * This means images have become the key for getting a good viewing experience with **Google Reader Plus**.

### Why Stumble Upon might feel the heat?

Websites like** Stumble Upon** or **Digg** deal with a community which promotes and drives traffic to websites. The fear is with Google being the number one search engine, what stops it from giving more and more relevance to a reader recommending an article on Google Reader rather than any other social media?

This sort of randomized looking at articles is very popular and I must say Google Reader Play does have a interesting and eye catching layout. I wonder now if they will take on websites like Stumble Upon and further end up dominating all facets of the internet or is this just a quirky service Google sometimes comes up with but hardly follows up on.

Try out Google Reader Play and write in your comments. I will surely be wanting to read your opinions.
