This post is a cross-post from <a href="http://wpveda.com/windows-live-spaces-will-be-outsourced-to-wordpress/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wpveda.com/windows-live-spaces-will-be-outsourced-to-wordpress/', 'WPVeda.com']);" >WPVeda.com</a> our blog dedicated to WordPress.

Microsoft has decided to close down Windows Live Spaces. It has tied up with Automattic the company which handles WordPress.com. So from now on in the future every Windows Live Spaces blog will have to be migrated to WordPress.com. All new sign-up will be redirected to WordPress.com.

This was announced by Microsoft and <a href="http://automattic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://automattic.com/', 'Automattic']);" >Automattic</a> at the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/techcrunch-disrupt-live-day-1/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/techcrunch-disrupt-live-day-1/', 'Techcrunch Disrupt']);" >Techcrunch Disrupt</a>.

This will allow <a href="http://wordpress.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.com', 'WordPress.com']);" ><strong>WordPress.com</strong></a> to be connected to Live Messenger. It can be used to update friends with a message when the blog is updated with a post. Along with that Live Spaces will cease to exist completely in six months.
