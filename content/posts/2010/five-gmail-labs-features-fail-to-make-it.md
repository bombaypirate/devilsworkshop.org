Though, Google had to say that the choice to upgrade and retire features was made on user feedback and usage, but it doesn&#8217;t look like the same. Here are the Gmail lab features that you won&#8217;t see anymore-

### Muzzle

This feature made it possible for gmail users to conserve screen in sidebar chat in Gmail. In simple words, it was meant to &#8220;**cut the crap**&#8221; from chat menu, by hiding your contact&#8217;s chat status messages. Now you can again see a cluttered version of gmail chat menu!

To protest against this, people have started signing a petition to get back muzzle, and a twitter account has also been made for the same- @GmailMuzzle

### Email Addict

This feature encouraged users to take a break from email. &#8220;Closes Gmail for 14 minutes&#8221;, providing much needed break to Gmail addicts. May be Google didn&#8217;t want you to to loose any time looking up their ads!! And for this, they retired such a nice app.

### Location in Signature & Random Signature

Both these features automated the signature processing in your mails. More info on these features can be seen <a title="read more" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-lab-edition-with-13-new-features/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Fixed width font

It is often annoying to see random font changes in your mails. This feature kept your messages on a fixed width for paragraph breaks, double spacing and <a title="read more" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-lab-edition-with-13-new-features/" target="_blank">more</a>.

Do you miss any of these features? No need to worry! You will get similar value from the Grease-monkey scripts too. Like, if you enjoyed the Muzzle feature, you can use the script &#8211; <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/69881" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/69881', 'Gmail Muzzle Lab Reviving']);" title="muzzle"  target="_blank">Gmail Muzzle Lab Reviving</a>.
