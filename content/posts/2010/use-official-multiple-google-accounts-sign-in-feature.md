We have had Greasemonkey scripts for Firefox and extensions on Chrome which allow people to sign in and jump from one Google account to another with a simple click of a button.

Google has been working on multiple signÂ  in and I think it is being made widely available with many Google accounts.

Here is a image of my accounts which I managed to get multiple sign in option to be enabled.

### How to enable Multiple Google accounts?

  * Just head over your <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/accounts/', 'Google accounts manager']);" >Google accounts manager</a> and then click on it to enable multiple sign in with Google.
  * This way once you log in you will see options as seen in the image below when ever your sign into your Google account for Google Calendar, Google Docs and Gmail.

  * This is great because from a security point of view its better than any external browser extension. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * If this option is not available to you now, do not worry it should be there within the next couple of days.

We have covered on DW options of using[ multiple Gmail accounts on Firefox][1] but this did involve downloading a Greasemonkey script which probably might have been a little too technical for non-techie users of Gmail. This new feature with Google will be quite useful and much easier.

Do you have multiple Google accounts? Do you think this will be a great way to use and shuffle your Google accounts? Do let me know through your comments.
