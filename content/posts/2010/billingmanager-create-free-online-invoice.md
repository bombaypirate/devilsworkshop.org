> **Editor&#8217;s Note:**  This free billing manager is being **discontinued** by its company and will not be available effective from 1st October 2011

I am not (and I was never) good in writing accounts. I do not understand terms used by Chartered Accountants as terms used by them are difficult to remember. That is the reason &#8211; I was looking for a system where I can quickly generate, store, e-mail, print, share, get the <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/list-of-100-adsense-revenue-sharing-sites/" target="_blank">revenue</a> overview, manage my Invoices & Estimates.

There were many issues with offline installations. After trying & tiring, I shifted my focus from offline software to online, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/?&fq[]=trove%3A747" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/?&fq[]=trove%3A747', 'open source scripts']);" target="_blank">open source scripts</a>! There were few minor issues for me with these too! For example: <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gmail-has-new-security-feature-to-avoid-accounts-from-being-hijacked/" target="_blank">security</a> of my server, database maintenance and, etc.

Then while on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-pagerank-updated-for-april-2010/" target="_blank">Google</a>, I found out that there are ready to use billing managers available. I was lit up & began exploring one-by-one. After fairly a lot of fact findings & adding trial invoices with all those systems, I zeroed down to this <a href="https://billingmanager.intuit.com/billing/free-online-invoicing.url" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://billingmanager.intuit.com/billing/free-online-invoicing.url', 'Billing Manager. ']);" target="_blank"><strong>Billing Manager. </strong></a>

Co-incidentally two days back one my friends who is a <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/zivity-a-social-network-promoting-beauty-20/" target="_blank">Photographer</a> called me up asking, he was looking for an invoicing software. While I was narrating him the details I thought of sharing it with all of you here.

I won&#8217;t stick to this particular system for life, but certainly I am going use it until I can buy my own <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/create-your-own-custom-linux-os-easily/" target="_blank">customized</a> paid software.

I have explored it for about seven days now &  finding it very handy. It has some very exciting features, which are required by a basic user like me.

It seems like I am on to organize billing data in a better way, and stop worrying about<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/winners-of-contest-for-handy-backup-software-license-codes/" target="_blank"> hard disk crashes</a>, etc.

I will quickly share key features now, which are a **must-have for non accountant** like me:)

**1. Easy Interface with simple familiar terms to grasp  
2. Nice customizations available with Indian currency  
3. Auto computations for services & tax, etc.  
4. Capability to print, e-mail & <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/convert-any-url-to-pdf/" target="_blank">export as a pdf</a> option.  
5. Estimates can be adapted to invoices.  
6. You can record a payment against invoice & same can be sent as a receipt.**

Here are a few screen shots of Billing Manager.

If you&#8217;re really interested, then I have a suggestion.  You sign-up & test it yourself to see what all you can do with it. It works on <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/how-to-save-bandwidth-on-limited-broadband-plans/" target="_blank">low bandwidth</a> & it can be accessed on an <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/airtel-to-sell-iphone-3gs-in-india/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>.

If you like it, let me know. If you don&#8217;t like it, then It&#8217;s not me who formulated this module.

And just in case you&#8217;re already using any such billing system, then do let me know. I would like to give it a try!
