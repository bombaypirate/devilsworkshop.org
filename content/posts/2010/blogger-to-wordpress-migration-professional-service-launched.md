  <strong>Update:</strong> Get updated information about <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/announcement-bloggertowporg-moved-rtcampcom/">Blogger to WordPress Migration Domain here</a>.
</p>

More than 2 years ago, I released my first [WordPress plugin for Blogger To WordPress Permalink Redirection][1]. A year later, I wrote a [fullproof guide to migrate Blogger.com blogs to WordPress without loosing permalinks, SEO juice and traffic][2].

Apart from free plugin and guide, we were offering professional migration service from long time to help bloggers who either did not have technical skills or time or both to do their migration themselves.

After helping many bloggers with our professional service, we decided to launch a new portal &#8211; <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/', 'BloggerToWp.org']);" >BloggerToWp.org</a>. This portal gives detailed information regarding features of our service and available packages, answers FAQ, lists blogs we have migrated among other details.

In this professional service, we will be doing additional things that we did not cover before like migrating images from Blogger.com server to your wordpress server using our own tool.

This is our first portal, so please let us know if u have any suggestion to improve.
