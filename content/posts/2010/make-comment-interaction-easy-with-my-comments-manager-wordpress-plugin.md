The best way one can get motivated in blogging is by getting appreciation through comments. Good comments and feedbacks always provide a positive energy to work better. But to get visitors commenting on your blog, you need to be interactive with your readers like ask questions and start communicating with them.

There are chances that you might lose your visitors, if you won’t reply to their comments and queries. It becomes bit time consuming to check out on which post you got the comment and it happens that you even forget to reply to comments because of other work.

To manage comments easily, I use a WordPress plug-in “Comments Manager WordPress Plugin”. It’s the best way to manage your comments and know how many replies are pending or ignore unwanted comments, all at a single screen.

We rtCamp team are so happy to announce and let you know about one plugin which we released for unreplied comment is My comment manager wordpress plugin. If you are a guest author at Devils&#8217; workshop, you can login to dashboard and see this plugin in action.

Here are few features of Comments Manager WordPress Plugin:
