We have heard that Images speaks a lot more than words, but what if you add words to your picture? It would be fun to add voice to pictures and share it with friends. You can easily create a motion picture selecting few [cool pictures][1] and adding voice or music to it. Does it seem tough?

I used to think it was tough, but with Fotobabble it is very easily achievable and more good thing is that is free to use .I love this service for blogging, I can select few creative commons pictures or screen shots from [photo galleries][2] , arrange them and add voice to make a perfect tutorial.
