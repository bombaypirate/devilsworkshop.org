When ever we talk about broadband connection in India, the most common problem which[<img class="wp-image-50256" style="margin: 20px 0px 10px 20px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/Airtel_Logo_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Airtel_Logo" width="111" height="44" align="right" />][1] we will face is [broadband speed][2]. The maximum speed which I have personally used from a home user perspective is 2 MBPS. Though [Airtel][3] speed on demand let me get 8 MBPS speed in the past but again paying 120rs/hour (2.5$) doesn’t sound affordable to me all the time.

[Airtel][4] has launched 2 new broadband plan for Delhi and Gurgaon :

  * 50 MBPS[ Broadband][5]– Rs. 8999 per month
  * 30 MBPS Broadband– Rs. 7999 per month

The data transfer is not unlimited. 200 GB of free data transfer are allowed in this plan, that mean’s you can download lots of data with blazing speed.

Though this doesn’t seems like affordable by a normal home user but from a business perspective this plan seems to be very much effective. Right now we are using Tata internet connection in our office with backup connection from Airtel.

If you are an Indian broadband user, I will love to know your view on this new broadband plan from Airtel?
