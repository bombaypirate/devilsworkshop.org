Just a few days ago, <a title="Opera 10.50 beta 1" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/opera-10-50-beta-released/" target="_blank">Opera 10.50 beta 1 </a>was introduced.

With opera storming its way through alpha and beta releases, this move can be crucial ahead of browser ballot where windows users will be presented with the Microsoft Browser Ballot from 1st March, which will force users to choose between the five most popular browsers presented in random order. Beta 2 contains many significant improvements over the first beta.

The changelog includes a list of bug and crash fixes along with tweaked styling. Some of the highlights of the changelog are-

  * Skin work, and tweaked styling of internal pages (opera:* and error pages)
  * Improved opera:config
  * Improved overlay authentication dialogs to avoid spoofing
  * Context menu fixes
  * Basic Web Storage user interface
  * Lots of crash fixes
  * Widgets fixes
