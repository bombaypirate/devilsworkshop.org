If you are using file-hosting websites like **Rapidshare **or **Megaupload **to download files you might come across many files which are split or sometimes the links to download these files are multiple.

<a href="http://www.linkrr.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkrr.com/', 'Linkrr']);" >Linkrr</a> is useful for converting text into links and opening them with a single click.

## How <a href="http://www.linkrr.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkrr.com', 'Linkrr']);" >Linkrr</a> works?

  * Simply copy the text into the box. I could also copy and past multiple lines of text which needed to be converted into HTML links.
  * Once done, click on &#8220;**Make clickable**!&#8221; and a list of links that will be opened are displayed.

  * All the links converted from text will being can be opened using at the same time. It does need you to disable pop-up blocker in some cases. This applies to Internet Explorer users.

Even though I tried creating links of our blogs in our network, I think Linkrr is more useful when downloading a big file that is split in parts and the link is posted or shared as text rather than a link which we can click on.

Do try out **Linkrr **and drop in your comments if you know of similar tools which makes managing multiple links easy.
