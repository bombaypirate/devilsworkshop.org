A new virus attack called “clickjacking worm” is targeting thousands Facebook users and spreading very quickly. The affected profiles can be identified by seeing the “Like” in the following links:

> “LOL this girl gets OWNED after a POLICE OFFICER reads her STATUS MESSAGE,”
> 
> “This man takes a picture of himself EVERYDAY for 8 YEARS!!,”
> 
> “The Prom Dress That Got This Girl Suspended From School”
> 
> “This Girl Has An Interesting Way Of Eating A Banana, Check It Out!”

Whenever a user clicks on the text, he is landed to a blank page stating “Click here to continue”. As soon as he will click on that page, the above message will be posted on his Facebook profile. This way there are lots of chances to spread this virus quickly.
