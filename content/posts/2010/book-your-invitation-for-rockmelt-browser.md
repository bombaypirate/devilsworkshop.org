It is based on <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chromium.org/Home', 'Chromium']);" >Chromium</a>.

## Some expected features of <a href="http://www.rockmelt.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rockmelt.com/', 'RockMelt']);" >RockMelt</a>

  * The browser is basically specific for Social Media usage. Facebook friends with their display images can be seen on the browser itself.
  * Along with this you can see multiple features to use Twitter, YouTube and Flickr.
  * This seems to try to mash together the concepts of social media apps like Tweet Deck with a browser like Chrome.

I do not have an invitation to sign-up and use the browser so I will post a full-fledged review of it in sometime in the future. ðŸ˜‰

### Sign up for <a href="http://www.rockmelt.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rockmelt.com/', 'RockMelt']);" >RockMelt</a>

Meanwhile you can sign-up for RockMelt with your Facebook account. It will send you an invitation soon so you can use RockMelt browser. This has actually helped create a lot of buzz about RockMelt because invites are available to people who get invited to RockMelt. I guess a viral campaign is a nice way to build up publicity for a browser.

There are many browsers out there but **RockMelt **seems to be focusing more on social media as its calling card. Will this work for it? Do drop in your comments and views.
