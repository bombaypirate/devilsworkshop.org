Google Buzz has introduced a **&#8216;Reshare&#8217; **feature which will allow Buzz users to share the original post and also give the person sharing it first credit for it. In it&#8217;s blog Google announced that** Buzz Reshare** feature will soon will be available for Buzz users.

### **About Buzz Reshare**

  * As mentioned before that the Buzz Reshare feature is pretty much to share something while giving credit to the original post on Buzz. This is very similar to [Twitter&#8217;s Retweet feature][1] or Facebook&#8217;s Via Feature.
  * This gives Buzz a great addition as it truly is more or less like a sharing forum rather than being a social network.
  * I think Google Buzz is a better forum than **Twitter** to share videos and images and** &#8216;Reshare&#8217;** can really tap into this penchant we have to share videos and images. ðŸ˜‰

If you Google Buzz account does not have a Reshare button then you might want to wait for a day or two and it should be made available.
