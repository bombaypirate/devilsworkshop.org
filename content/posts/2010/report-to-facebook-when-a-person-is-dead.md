You all might have aware of the recent dubai-manglore flight tragedy which took off more than 160 lives. In that 160 people, I know Facebook and twitter profiles of the two people who died in the tragedy. When media and other websites published their Facebook profile link, people flood their comments on their Facebook wall etc.

So, the question is How to reduce the unfair and unwanted comments in the deceased users Facebook profile ? and also I find other social networks find it difficult to tackle such issues. It is better to report Facebook and they make the profile to set some privacy etc.

Facebook has put some effort by having a separate page for reporting a deceased users profile page. I&#8217;m not sure how many knew that Facebook has introduced such kind of things. But anyway, I wanted to share with you all.

<p style="text-align: center">

So, you can use the link to report to Facebook, if you find some one has died and if you want to memorialize or remove the personâ€™s account.

Report a Deceased Person&#8217;s Profile &#8211; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?ref=pf#!/help/contact.php?show_form=deceased" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/help/?ref=pf#!/help/contact.php?show_form=deceased', 'Facebook Link']);" >Facebook Link</a>
