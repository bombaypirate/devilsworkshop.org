I like that you can play this game with your friends only. Unlike other online games in which you are playing against strangers, this can be fun thing to do with your friends online. Those friends you cannot meet due to distance but can play together. Wow.

This can be an interesting game to play and enjoy! What do you think?Do you know any other such application? Do share them through your comments below.
