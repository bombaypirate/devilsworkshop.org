I love making friends on **Facebook**, you can see that by the number of friends I have on my Facebook account. But sometimes I really get in trouble when I send a **Friend Request** and later I regret doing so. In that case the person may add me and I have to remove him/her from my friend list later. There was no tool to delete a friend request itself. But now there is. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

As in the image below you can see I have sent a Friend Request which is **waiting for confirmation**.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/how-to-delete-an-awaiting-friend-request-on-facebook/screenshot_015/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/how-to-delete-an-awaiting-friend-request-on-facebook/screenshot_015/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-2913"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-53654" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/screenshot_015.png" alt="" width="464" height="91" /></a>

If I do not want to get added by that person due to any reasons I can just go back to that page as below and cancel the request.

### How to delete the friend request?

  * goto the home page of that person
  * besides the name you will be see &#8216;Awaiting friend confirmation&#8217;
  * Click **&#8216;x&#8217;**
  * It has been cancelled <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Facebook developers are getting serious and reducing spam as much as possible. Last week also we saw that <a href="http://fbknol.com/ignore-requests-and-report-them-as-spam-on-facebook/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/ignore-requests-and-report-them-as-spam-on-facebook/', '&#8216;not now&#8217; and &#8216;Report Spam&#8217;']);" >&#8216;not now&#8217; and &#8216;Report Spam&#8217;</a> features were launched and now this. Overall, Facebook is making some good and nice changes which are getting highly appreciated. I thank Mark Zuckerberg for taking extra pains these days and i secretly wish Facebook to rock!
