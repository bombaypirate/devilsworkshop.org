NOKIA has launched its global financial services initiatives, with its pilot plan starting in Pune, India and to be rolled out in rest of the cities in a few months. The announcement came at **World Mobile Congress 2010** in Barcelona, Spain.

Nokia has teamed up with YES Bank to introduce Nokia money  services in one of the largest Metropolitan in India- **Pune**. The service will enable the people to transfer money by simply using their mobile phone number. They will also be enabled to pay mobile bills, recharge SIM cards with top-ups and pay for the goods and services that user avails.

Nokia plans to roll out Nokia money in 20 countries in its first phase, and India is one of them. **Teppo Pavola**, the global head of Nokia Money, when asked about <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/telecom/Nokia-plans-to-launch-m-banking-services/articleshow/5233922.cms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/telecom/Nokia-plans-to-launch-m-banking-services/articleshow/5233922.cms', 'regulatory challenges in India']);" title="Nokia money- Economic Times">regulatory challenges in India</a>, answered-

> The regulations are real tough in India compared to Philippines and Kenya. As RBI has a know your customer policy for banks, this could act as a limitation for the Nokia agents. Hence, we are talking to the banks in India who will work around the regulatory issues, bring the licenses and undertake cash management.
