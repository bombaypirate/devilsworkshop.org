When I started writing for **Devils&#8217; Workshop** last year, I wrote a post about how the [pie is shrinking for Internet Explorer][1] when it comes to the browser market. In those days Internet Explorer market share had fallen from heady 70&#8217;s down to mid 60&#8217;s when it come to the percentages. The one browser gaining momentum was **Firefox** and closely on its heels was **Chrome**.

I decided to check some stats on **Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer** when it came to their market share for the month of June 2010 and the stats threw up some interesting trends.

  * Some of the things that stand out are that **Internet Explorer&#8217;s** share is at** 60.32%**. This is actually better than a month ago but over all if you compared it to last **October** it is quite disappointing when it was about 66%.
  * The interesting part comes reading the **Firefox** and **Chrome** numbers. Chrome in the last 10 months has probably doubled its market share from **3.17%** to **7.24%** now. Firefox has not grown much but seems like plateauing out as in October 2010 it had **23.75%** is now only at **23.81%**.
  * I think this has been mainly due to **Chrome** being a real competitor and is pretty much as good as any other browser. It has added the options of syncing bookmarks and settings. It has added extensions support and that has led **Chrome** to grow with lightening speed.

Good news is** [][2]**[Mozilla Firefox 4 will probably spruce up the browser][3][][2] and really give us something amazing to work with. But Firefox lacks the solid support of a internet giant which Chrome enjoys.

With **Chrome OS** expected later in the year I think in all probability Firefox is in trouble over the long run.

What are your thoughts about Firefox and its growth prospects overall? Do let me know through your comments.
