We all love Facebook. One of the most intuitive features of Facebook is the &#8216;Like&#8217; button. This gives us the power to show our friends that we liked or support something they shared on Facebook. I came across a funny caricature about how life is often imitated online. Atleast when it comes paying people attention based on their gender. At least according to this sketch even a Nobel prize win for a guy won&#8217;t be as popular as a girl sharing a video of a cute &#8216;puppy&#8217;.

I am not sure how many women will agree with me wholly about the joke in the sketch but it does have a bit of truth in it doesn&#8217;t it? Do drop in your comments and views.
