**Gmail** has many features in it&#8217;s layout which is there by default but sometimes can be not very useful. Many a times you might no want to see those pesky ads on **Gmail**. I personally have never clicked or paid any notice to them. At times I wish I could just make the chat box disappear. I guess what I really want is a way to customize** Gmail**. Thankfully I have come across a method of doing this on both **Chrome** and **Firefox** browsers.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-20613" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/customize-your-gmail-layout/customized_gmail/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20613" title="customized_gmail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/02/customized_gmail.png" alt="" width="500" height="223" /></a>

### Gmail customization

  * If you are using **Firefox** <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6076" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6076', 'click here to download the add-on']);" >click here to download the add-on</a>, with **Chrome** <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gmfocnipihcoejdieiimhiecclokidea" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gmfocnipihcoejdieiimhiecclokidea', 'click here to download the extension']);" >click here to download the extension</a>.
  * I could remove the advertisements that appear with Gmail.
  * Allow attachments icons. This can be helpful as it gives me an idea if its a **pdf** file or **jpg** image that is attached. ðŸ˜‰
  * You can get more simplistic and remove **chat**, **footer** and also **invite friends box** from your Gmail layout.
  * Chrome extension does have the option of [removing Google buzz][1] but the same feature is not available with the Firefox add-on. I guess that is because both are not by the same developer.

As we at **Devil&#8217;s Workshop** use Google apps for our email I testing if it works with the apps. And it does work just as well it does with a Gmail account. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Try out the these add-ons or extension depending on the browser you have. Some of the customizations depend upon on the browser you are using as the add-on and extension are no made by the same developers. As a matter of fact the Chrome extension has been <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5477037/unofficial-better-gmail-for-chrome-bends-gmail-to-your-will" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lifehacker.com/5477037/unofficial-better-gmail-for-chrome-bends-gmail-to-your-will', 'inspired from the Firefox add-on']);" >inspired from the Firefox add-on</a> and still has more features in the pipeline.

Do drop in your comments with what you think about customizing Gmail.
