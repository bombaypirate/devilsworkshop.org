Did you notice that now you can change what you wish to see on your wall? Most recent section was always there on Facebook, but now you can use it in a better way.

You can change what you see on the news feed. You can filter them according to your friends, photos, status updates, games etc. The best thing I found out was I can choose to see which friend&#8217;s update should come on my news feed and which friend&#8217;s update should not bother me.

This may come handy if you have made a friend who keeps changing his status update every hour, and you are least bothered with what he wants to say. Why not just remove him from your news feed. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

## How to remove a friend from your news feed?

  * Click on Most recent.
  * Select Edit options.
  * Write the name of the person, whose updates you don&#8217;t want to see.
  * Save

This can be a good way to see your updates. I guess rather than looking at the news feed all at once , we should be able to divide it so. Facebook gives you the recommended friends list. It should also give us the option to choose blogs that we are following so that we can scan the updates on out home page.

How much do you like this feature and according Â to you what else should be added. Share your views through comments below. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
