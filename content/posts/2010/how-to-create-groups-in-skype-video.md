Skype is our favorite tool to communicate at <a href="http://rtcamp.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com', 'rtCamp']);" >rtCamp</a> and one of the main reason for that is because we often end up working from home and hence Skype is a easier way to be communicate and stay connected with the team. As an Editor I have to keep in touch with other Editors and Admins working on our blog network and one create way to collaborate is to create a group within Skype.

### **How to create a group on Skype?**

  * When you sign into **Skype** and look up your contacts online. Click on** Contacts **and then **Create New Group.**
  * This will create a new group. Make sure to give it a relevant name and start dragging and dropping your contacts into this new group.
  * Also write in a message to your contacts to let them know that you have created a group on Skype which includes them.
  * Best way to keep in touch with such a group is to save them in your contacts list.

Below is a video demo of how it is done. ðŸ˜‰
