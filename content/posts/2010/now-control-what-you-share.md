I always love to try new **applications** on Facebook and I do not like it when they ask you to allow wall posts andÂ  information. This seems irritating at times. I don&#8217;t always want them to be displayed on the home page. Earlier I could disable the applications but now, after yesterday&#8217;s meeting <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130', 'Facebook has rolled on new features']);" >Facebook has rolled on new features</a>. Other than <a href="http://fbknol.com/facebook-unveils-new-groups-to-share-collaborate-and-group-chat/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/facebook-unveils-new-groups-to-share-collaborate-and-group-chat/', 'Group feature ']);" >Group feature </a>and Downloads, Facebook has come up with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications', 'Application Dashboard']);" >Application Dashboard</a>.

You can see the image above is the Application Dashboard of my profile.

We can make changes in our applications by selecting any one of them from Application Dashboard.

### With the Application Dashboard you can:

  * View when did you last use that application.
  * The information that application is using.
  * Manage if you want that application to be published as post on your wall or not.
  * Stop it by accessing your data at any time.
  * Remove that application all together.

Phew <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> lots of points, eh! Now with this increased visibility people can control the Facebook usage and manage the way any application is displayed on their **Facebook wall**. This will really be helpful for people like me who love to use Facebook applications or games. I just do not want to bother my friends with all the updates of my games or applications if they do not use them.

According to **Mark Zuckerberg** people should have a control over their information, if they want they can choose to share a specific information with only special friends. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I am going to tweak the new features now and improve my Facebook profile a bit. What are you waiting for? Go ahead and tell me what all did you do. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
