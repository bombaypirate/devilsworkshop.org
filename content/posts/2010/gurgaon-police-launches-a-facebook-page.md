I am always thrilled by **social media**. You can use it for social networking or for spreading awareness. This afternoon I came across this new Page being launched by **Gurgaon Traffic Police**.

After the success of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Delhi-India/Delhi-Traffic-Police/117817371573308" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Delhi-India/Delhi-Traffic-Police/117817371573308', 'Delhi Traffic Police&#8217;s Facebook page']);" >Delhi Traffic Police&#8217;s Facebook page</a> now Gurgaon Traffic Police has <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Gurgaon-police-launch-SMS-service--Facebook-page-for-public/694237/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Gurgaon-police-launch-SMS-service--Facebook-page-for-public/694237/', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that they will now post the photos, and information about those who violate traffic laws on the Gurgaon Traffic Police&#8217;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/pages/Gurgaon-India/Gurgaon-Traffic-Police/150521321651358" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/pages/Gurgaon-India/Gurgaon-Traffic-Police/150521321651358', 'webpage']);" >webpage</a>. This service is launched by Gurgaon Police Commissioner S S Deswal.

If you see anybody **violating the traffic rules**, just click the photo along with his bike/car number and paste it on the **Facebook page**. The account will be managed by police officials and that person will be charged. They have announced an SMS service also in which you can send a message if you see some violations. The photographs of repeat violators will be posted on this page. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

These days youngsters and almost everyone is having a Facebook account and busy updating their status messages while on move. So, it wont be a problem for anyone. People can give suggestions on ways for improving the traffic scenario also by posting on the webpage.

I find this very interesting. This is a good way to check the traffic. Other states or cities should also come forward and do such things.What do you think? What else can be done? Share your views below through the comments.
