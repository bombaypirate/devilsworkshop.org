Facebook is a bit like a club. Where you get to meet interesting people, add common friends, have virtual farms and share photos online with friends without our knowing, other people can peek into them thanks to <a href="http://fbknol.com/2010/05/19/reclaimprivacy-scan-your-facebook-privacy-level-settings/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/2010/05/19/reclaimprivacy-scan-your-facebook-privacy-level-settings/', 'privacy problems']);" >privacy problems</a>.

This is all possible obviously because it is virtual but what would our lives be like if **Facebook** was real and not virtual. How would it be to come across unwanted random status messages or hide from people who wanted to chat with us.

A funny video was created about how **Facebook** would be in real life. Have a look below and do let us know what do you think about it?  
It does slightly put our silliness on **Facebook** into perspective when it is enacted out like a part of real life.

Do let us know if you think Facebook has taken over our real life?
