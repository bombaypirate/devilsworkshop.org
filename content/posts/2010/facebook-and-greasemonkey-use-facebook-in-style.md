How many times have you been irritated by the useless posts and invites from various <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/', 'Facebook']);" >Facebook</a> applications, you get on your wall? Have you ever wondered that you *might* be able to stop all these at once, and not blocking the endless queue one-by-one? If yes, then this post is definitely for you.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full  wp-image-54302" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2009/11/Greasemonkey-Logo.jpg" alt="Greasemonkey facebook" width="500" height="338" />][1]

Various applications and games on Facebook are written in such API that sends auto notifications and offers to all the people in the friend list of the person playing it. But not all of us log in to Facebook just to play games. For many of us, Facebook is the indispensible medium of net connect with our friends and relatives. And in recent times, it has become a necessity.

Anyways, coming to the point, the thing that comes to rescue us from all the undesirable things posted automatically on our walls is **<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748', 'Greasemonkey.']);" >Greasemonkey.</a> **

And for people, who don’t know what it is, it is an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/', 'Add-on']);" >Add-on</a> for the mighty web browser, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mozilla.com/firefox', 'Mozilla Firefox']);" >Mozilla Firefox</a>. With Greasemonkey, you have the power to customize any website on the internet, the way YOU want it to be. If you don’t like the color theme of this website, you can even change that for you!

Greasemonkey works with the concept of <a href="http://www.userscripts.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.userscripts.org/', 'Userscripts']);" >Userscripts</a>. There is a huge community dedicated to the development and implementation of user scripts for Greasemonkey. Just head on to <a href="http://www.userscripts.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.userscripts.org/', 'http://www.userscripts.org']);" >http://www.userscripts.org</a> to find a user script that matches your interest and customize and website you want! Or better, you can write your own script if you don’t get a ready-made one from there.

Coming to purify your Facebook experience, the user script is called <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/44459" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/44459', 'Facebook Purity']);" >Facebook Purity</a>. And as the name suggests, it indeed makes your Facebook experience, just pure! No more spams on you wall and there are just LOTS of other features you can get. This Greasemonkey script removes all messages posted by applications to your homepage. It gets rid of messages about quizes etc, basically all messages from any applications created by external developers. Just leaving messages from the original Facebook apps such as status updates, wall posts, links, notes, photos, etc behind.

**PLUS: **You also have a *single click** ***option to show the things, FB purity has blocked. So, in case, you have some spare time, you can just click and all the application invites will be visible on your wall!

Thrilled about how pure your Facebook can get? Then wait for other upcoming posts for much more awesome scripts.
