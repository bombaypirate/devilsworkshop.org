If you are using Windows it is almost impossible not to come across error codes which pop up with every times there is something that goes wrong with your computer. Usually these error codes mean something and that is exactly what **Error Goblin** allows you to look up.

### **About <a href="http://www.errorgoblin.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.errorgoblin.com/', 'Error Goblin']);" >Error Goblin</a>**

  * I very often I get a error code which leaves me totally flummoxed about what has gone wrong. One way to deal with this is to start looking up the error code on Google and get links to some KB article on a Microsoft Support website.
  * Sometimes there is no real need for this entire process and you might not be connected to the internet. This is where I feel <a href="http://errorgoblin.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://errorgoblin.com', 'Error Goblin']);" >Error Goblin</a> can be quite handy.
  * As you can see in the image above I had checked out what Error code **0xe2** meant. It correctly shows that the file contains a virus and cannot be opened.

The other great feature of this website is I can download the error code descriptions locally just in case when I am searching for a error code and do not have access to the internet.
