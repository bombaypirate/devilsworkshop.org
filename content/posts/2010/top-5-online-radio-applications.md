  I get disappointed with annoying messages like- 'This application is not supported in your country'. After a bit of searching, I was thrilled with the options available which are supported in my country! Not only can you listen to the usual hip hop, R&B, jazz category, you can also hear Tamil and Punjabi music.
  
  Here is a list of my top 5 picks for keeping you "tuned" with the hippest radio stations around the globe:

Previously I wrote about the [top 5 applications to create music playlists online][1]. Today, the mood lingers on but with a bit of nostalgia. I&#8217;m talking about online radio.

I get disappointed with annoying messages like &#8216;This application is not supported in your country&#8217;. After a bit of searching, I was thrilled with the options available which *are *supported in my country! Not only can you listen to the usual hip hop, R&B, jazz category, you can also hear Tamil and Punjabi music.

Here is a list of my top 5 picks for keeping you &#8220;tuned&#8221; with the hippest radio stations around the globe:

## #1. <a href="http://www.live365.com/index.live" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.live365.com/index.live', 'Live365.com']);" target="_blank">Live365.com</a>

With its own Wikipedia page, Nanocosm Inc.&#8217;s Live365 is one of the most popular online radio networks. It has more than 7000 broadcasters from over 150 countries. I am definitely impressed because it&#8217;s neatly classified with genres and has great sound quality. Must try &#8211; That 70&#8217;s Channel.

## #2. <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shoutcast.com/', 'SHOUTcast.com']);" target="_blank">SHOUTcast.com</a>:

Every genre of music has sub-genres. The radio opens up in a separate window which makes it easy to browse through other options. While you&#8217;re there, don&#8217;t forget to try the Indian music streamers &#8211; it has Bollywood, Hindi and Tamil music! It also displays the last song played by any radio station.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31608" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-online-radio-applications/shoutcastlogo/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31608" title="ShoutcastLogo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/ShoutcastLogo.png" alt="" width="258" height="85" /></a>

## #3. <a href="http://www.radiolicious.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.radiolicious.com', 'Radiolicious.com']);" target="_blank">Radiolicious.com</a>

Radiolicious has great variety, and is not as cluttered as the others. You have to simply browse through the pages and choose what you like. You can also download a version compatible with your iPhones/iPads.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31609" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-online-radio-applications/radioliciouslogo/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31609" title="RadioliciousLogo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/RadioliciousLogo.png" alt="" width="396" height="105" /></a>

## #4. <a href="http://www.last.fm/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.last.fm/', 'Last.fm']);" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>

Though you have to create an account here, it doesn&#8217;t take much time. My favorite is the <a href="http://www.last.fm/listen#pane=webRadioPlayer&station=%252Flisten%252Fartist%252FRed%252BHot%252BChili%252BPeppers%252Fsimilarartists" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.last.fm/listen#pane=webRadioPlayer&station=%252Flisten%252Fartist%252FRed%252BHot%252BChili%252BPeppers%252Fsimilarartists', 'Red Hot Chilli Peppers Radio']);" >Red Hot Chilli Peppers Radio</a>. You can change the skins as well but red or black are the only choices.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31610" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-online-radio-applications/lastfmlogo/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31610" title="LastfmLogo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/LastfmLogo.png" alt="" width="163" height="125" /></a>

## #5. <a href="http://hypem.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hypem.com/', 'HypeMachine.com']);" target="_blank">HypeMachine.com</a>

It&#8217;s not exactly an online radio, but I really want you guys to know about it. ðŸ˜› Hype Machine tracks various music related blogs and uploads the most popular and interesting works of new artists. I think it is offbeat and a pleasant break if you have an ear for new artists.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-31611" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/top-5-online-radio-applications/hypemachinelogo/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31611" title="HypeMachinelogo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/11/HypeMachinelogo.png" alt="" width="273" height="126" /></a>

The radio was invented somewhere through the 19th century but strangely hasn&#8217;t gone out of vogue as yet. To think of it, radio paved way for our iPods and Zunes, personally its my fashion statement as well (I wear a chain with an antique transistor engraving!). Hopefully, these applications will keep the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Ga_Ga" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Ga_Ga', 'radio gaga']);" >radio gaga</a>&#8216; still going on amongst us.

Do let me know which one is your favorite through your comments.
