Do you have to login to slow, almost impossible Railway enquiry internet sites? Now there is an application that lets you check the Indian Railway status with no problem at all.

## What all you can do ?

  * Search Trains
  * Check Availability in Trains
  * Check PNR
  * Check Fare
  * Check Route/Time Table
  * Subscribe for Email, Sms, Gtalk, PNR status-Free
  * Location & Timing of a running Train

All the above things can be checked without login to some other site, that is you can continue to chat, check your friend&#8217;s status messages and check your railway information.:) This is a good application that can come handy in many terms.

### How to Use it ?

-> Login to your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/', 'Facebook account']);" >Facebook account</a>.

-> Click on the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/railenquiry" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.facebook.com/railenquiry', 'application']);" >application</a>. You will be asked to allow the application.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_029/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_029/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3122"><img class="alignnone size-full  wp-image-53914" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/screenshot_029.png" alt="" width="400" height="252" /></a>

-> Once you have allowed the application, it asks you to &#8216;Invite your friends to join&#8217;. If you want to send requests you can send them or choose to just &#8216;Skip&#8217;.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_030/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_030/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3123"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3123" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/screenshot_030.png" alt="" width="400" height="83" /></a>

-> Now you can see the welcome screen, with text boxes to enter the destination etc for a train, PNR status.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_031/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_031/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3124"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3124" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/screenshot_031.png" alt="" width="400" height="219" /></a>

-> So go ahead and check the availability and book the ticket. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Next time when you want to go to the application you can directly click on the left hand side corner of your screen that tells about application.

<a href="http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_032/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fbknol.com/indian-railways-now-on-facebook/screenshot_032/', '']);" rel="attachment wp-att-3125"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3125" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/10/screenshot_032.png" alt="" width="166" height="301" /></a>
