<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/cheapest-deals-mobiles-phones-books-mysmartprice/mysmartprice/" rel="attachment wp-att-35041"><img class="size-full wp-image-35041 alignright" title="MySmartPrice" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/12/MySmartPrice.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a> When it comes to looking up a new mobile phone or a book online, the first thing we look for is how to get the cheapest deal for it. Also rather than looking up individual sites and their listings, it would be really nice to look up and compare prices at one place.

With ***<a href="http://www.mysmartprice.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mysmartprice.com', 'MySmartPrice']);" >MySmartPrice</a>*** we can look up the cheapest and best deals on mobile phones and books. The site looks up the best deals from several Indian online stores.

## Searching for Cheapest Mobile Phones

  * I really liked the search features of this website when it came to looking up mobile phones.
  * The mobile phones could be searched individually or one can browse through results on a manufacturer.
  * I found the Android section also quite useful to look up comparative prices.

## Searching for the cheapest books

  * Personally I liked this section a lot because it is very hard to look up good deals for books. Most times a not so popular book is not even available.
  * I looked up some history related non-fiction books which I have had a hard time looking up and I was not disappointed. I guess this is the advantage of searching across various online stores from a single place.
