Many website have widgets to basically link up with other websites or even display information. Desktopify will be able to convert web widgets into desktop widgets. It allowed me to create Desktop widgets with two simple steps that is I had to paste the widget code and <a href="http://desktopify.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://desktopify.com/', 'Desktopify']);" >Desktopify</a> can automatically create a desktop widget for me with a single click.

<!--more-->Great idea if you are running a web service as you can use this to create your own desktop widget and prompt your visitors to use a 

**Desktop Widget**. It is quite handy as it also allows sending updates, messages and also monitors stats for the number of people using the widget.

### **About <a href="http://desktopify.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://desktopify.com/', 'Desktopify']);" >Desktopify</a>**

  * These desktop widgets created with **Desktopify** are stand alone and can be used by Windows and Mac users.
  * It supports HTML, JavaScript and shows Flash.
  * It is interactive and also allows the webmaster to send Desktop alerts to everyone who has the desktop widget.

Here is a video below I have included from their website which gives a good demo of how Desktopify can be used for creating desktop widgets.  


I personally liked the ease with which I could create widgets and put them up on my desktop. Desktopify also has a bookmark-let which allows creating any block of a website into a desktop gadget.

Do try it out and let me know if you like using Desktop widgets for news and views. Also if you use any other service to create desktop widgets do let us know.
