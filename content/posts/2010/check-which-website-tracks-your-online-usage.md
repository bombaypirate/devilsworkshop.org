One of the issues while you sign-up with a website is we do not really read through the disclaimers or terms of services in great detail. Mostly we sign-up to websites thanks to their relevance and reputation. Some of these websites do something called as tracking out activity and sharing this info with advertisers for targeted advertising. I had written about [how websites or services track your usage and determine your unique identity][1]. I guess this can also be done not just for tracking visits but also for focused advertising.

This can be helpful in some places but it would be wise not to share too many personal and financial details on websites which track your usage and also share it with advertisers.

So now you are using these web services and have no time to read through the scores of Terms and Conditions you have causally agreed to. To deal with this predicament we have a Firefox add-on which easily tracks any website which is tracking your information and sharing it.

### **About <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14454" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14454', 'Privacy Choice']);" >Privacy Choice</a>**

  * Privacy Choice can be installed on your Firefox Browser and when you are on a website you want to check details on their tracking and sharing of info you can go ahead and click on their small Privacy Icon next to the address bar.
  * This pulls up a page with details of services which are tracking. Most blogs will be tracking usage which can then be later used for targeted advertising.
  * It also has a service for webmasters to see if their websites are being tracked in anyway they might not know about so their website is more secure from a privacy angle.
