The <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bluetooth.com', 'Bluetooth Special Interest Group']);" target="_blank">Bluetooth Special Interest Group</a> has finalized the **[Bluetooth][1] 4.0** specs. It is expected to reach manufacturers by the end of August 2010, with hardware expected to reach the market in late 2010 or early 2011.

This newer version is based on low energy module and hence, it can be built into products such as watches, wireless keyboards, gaming and sports sensors, health care products, which can then connect and communicate with host devices such as <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/anyremote-control-linux-pc-using-bluetooth-mobile-as-remote/" target="_blank">mobile phones</a> and <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/enabling-bluetooth-file-transfer-on-mac-os-x-leopard/" target="_blank">personal computers</a>.

Main features for users like us would be,** resistance to interference** and range can be optimized as per application demands **upto 200 feets or even beyond** (Currently it is ~ 30 feets). This would be specifically required for, in-home sensor applications where longer range is a necessity. This all is going to extend Personal Area Network (PAN).

According to latest press release from Bluetooth Special Interest Group, More than 8 new Bluetooth enabled products are qualified every working day and more than 19 million Bluetooth units are shipping per week. There are nearly three billion Bluetooth devices in the market and that number climbs daily, making it the only proven wireless choice for developers, product manufacturers, and consumers worldwide**.**

**  
Features:**

  * Ease of implementation both independently and in coexistence with classic Bluetooth [technology][2].

  * Low cost as a standalone device and minimal cost addition when integrated into a Bluetooth dual mode device

  * Extremely low power consumption. Especially low standby currents for applications with long idle times between active radio use.

  * Low peak and average power consumption to enable button cell applications with minimal external componentry such as capacitors and power conditioning circuits

  * Robustness and resistance to interference

  * The ability to provide a variety of range, extending to full home coverage

  * Fast startup and shut down times

  * Physical and operational coexistence with classic Bluetooth technology

  * Similar level of privacy and security that Bluetooth v2.1 has today.

Looks like one more big step to stay wireless.
