Okay first of all apologies to everyone for coming out with **Blogger$ of the Month** results so late. We at DW were a little tied up with our redesign project.

Blogger$ of the Month in December 2009 was a little different than any we had before. First and foremost we have three winners and not ranked 1-2-3 but rather winners who ranked no 1 for three different blogs on our **rtBlogs **network.

### Blogger$ of the Month

One of them is to compeltely redesign and you will be happy to know we have already started the coding work on the new theme.
