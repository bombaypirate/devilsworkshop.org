I was reading on <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/04/16/facebook-at-work/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mashable.com/2010/04/16/facebook-at-work/', 'Mashable']);" >Mashable</a> a interesting post on a survey done which shows a bit of a snapshot of the websites which companies visit with their super fast internet connections. Obviously here we cannot expect shopping portals or blogs to really dominate but expect Social networking websites along Search websites dominating which websites are visited by the corporate world.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-22315" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/you-tube-takes-down-the-real-time-video-sharing-toolbar/youtube_logo-jpg/"><img class="size-full  alignnone wp-image-52167" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/03/YouTube_logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="151" /></a>

Here below is the list of top 5 websites which hog bandwidth for companies according to <a href="http://www.network-box.com/node/533" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.network-box.com/node/533', 'Network-Box']);" >Network-Box</a>

  1. YouTube â€“ 10 %
  2. Facebook â€“ 4.5 %
  3. Windows Update â€“ 3.3 %
  4. Yimg (Yahoo!&#8217;s image server) â€“ 2.7 %
  5. Google â€“ 2.5 %

I often see many people arguing for and against banning social networking websites as they waste company time and resources according to many management gurus. But clearly shows that at least when it comes to bandwidth You Tube hogs the bandwidth twice as much as Facebook which is 2nd place.

On the other hand Google comes at a paltry 2.5 % which is incredible as most people are searching and that ideally wont be too much bandwidth.

I decided to check how much time I spend on You tube myself and I actually spend quite a bit of time and I am sure even for personal users You Tube must be a top hog of the bandwidth.

So my question is should&#8217;nt **IT admins** ban **You Tube** rather than **Facebook** and **Orkut** ? Or is You Tube very educational but then some can argue so are social networking sites. ðŸ˜›

What are you thoughts on it? Do drop in your comments to let me know about them. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
