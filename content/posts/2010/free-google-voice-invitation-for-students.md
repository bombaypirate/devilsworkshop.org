Some time back we told you about <a title="What is google voice" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-voice-choose-one-common-number-for-all-your-phones/" target="_blank">Google voice service</a> and since that time people are looking to get a Google voice account. Right now Google voice is invitation based . Though Google understand that this service could be very useful for students and that’s why they started offering Google voice invitation to students.

[<img class="wp-image-52983" style="float: none;margin: 10px auto;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/05/googlevoiceinvite_thumb.png" border="0" alt="google-voice-invite" width="500" height="373" />][1]

Students need to have .edu Email address in order to grab Google voice invitation.

According to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-voice-invites-for-students.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-voice-invites-for-students.html', 'official announcement']);" target="_blank">official announcement</a>:

> We’ve heard college students in particular really appreciate getting their voicemail sent to their email, sending free text messages and reading voicemail transcriptions rather than listening to messages (especially handy while in class).starting today, we’ll be giving priority Google Voice invites to students. To get an invite, just visit <a href="https://www.google.com/voice/students" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/voice/students', 'google.com/voice/students']);" >google.com/voice/students</a> and enter an email address that that ends in **.edu**.

So if you are a student you can quickly grab your Google voice account.
