**Facebook** has tested **photo promotion** feature from quite sometime now. Many of you must have noticed on upper right side of you homepage saying &#8216;**Photo Memories&#8217;** or &#8216;**Recommended Photos**&#8216;. Recommended Photos feature was present on Facebook since long but now it is seen **Site-wide**.

**Why do I like it?**

  * Instead of showing credits or advertisements I found it really good to see some old photo memories of my friends.
  * It does give you a surprise and sort of helps in refreshing old memories with friends. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

What do you think of such a feature? Don&#8217;t you think that Facebook should have more such features. Do let me know with your comments. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
