Samsung might have had its confidence a little dented after [losing to Apple over the patent case][1], but nothing puts behind a bad week like announcing new products. Samsung has done just that by announcing some interesting gadgets at the IFA event in Berlin, Germany.

### Samsung Galaxy Camera

Samsung might be one of Apple&#8217;s big competitor but it seems they have not forgotten Sony either. Galaxy Camera is a digital camera which allows sharing photos and videos online with Wi-Fi. It can also share with other Wi-Fi devices nearby.

### Samsung Galaxy Note 2
