Lately, a lot of content developers use infographics to connect with followers a lot more. Infographics are usually large image files which show trends in a graphical format. The idea is to use charts and graphs, to say something interesting without taking up a lot of time to read.

But what about creating your own infographic, with data taken from your own twitter account. <a href="http://vizify.com/tweetsheet" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vizify.com/tweetsheet', 'Vizify Tweetsheet']);" >Vizify Tweetsheet</a>, is one such online tool that does something similar.
