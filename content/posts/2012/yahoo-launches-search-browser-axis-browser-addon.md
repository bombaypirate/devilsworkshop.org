Yahoo has launched Axis which is it calls a new search browser. I was a little surprised on why Yahoo was launching a new browser, as I would imagine its best talent would be employed in improving search and other services.

Well Yahoo Axis is not exactly a browser but a set of browser extensions which work with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari on the desktops. It is also available as a standalone app for iPhone or iPads.

### Features of Yahoo Axis

  * The extension basically provides the ability to search for stuff online, saving a webpage as read later and bookmarking.
  * The layout is rather neat and search seems to be more visually attractive than the usual search engines which show a bunch of links.
  * Yahoo Axis will probably a lot more useful as phone and tablet apps. At the moment it is only available on iOS platform.

[Yahoo might be a company in decline][1], but it still is visited by millions everyday. So this app might be quite a interesting development for users. The idea might be novel but I do think it is a case of too little, too late for Yahoo as a internet giant.
