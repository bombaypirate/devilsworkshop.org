The unique part of these domain names are that they are either single or double characters.

So for example domain names like **A.org or ZQ.org **are up for sale. It seems as the demand for such unique domain names is very high, GoDaddy is taking the auction route.

You can look up the entire list of single and double character .ORG domain names available at <a href="http://GoDaddy.com/ORGAuction." onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://GoDaddy.com/ORGAuction.']);" >this link</a>.

Unique domain names with single or two characters are in great demand because they are extremely easy to remember. A good example of this is Twitter&#8217;s short URL domain being **t.co**

### Expect even more unique Domain names in the future

With [ICANN allowing more top-level domain names in any script][2] a mad rush was seen by the world&#8217;s biggest technology companies like [Google bid for 101 top-level domain names][3].

Many of these unique top-level domain names will see the option of more unique domain names becoming available to the general public.

Some internet experts do think that having too many options will actually force large companies to unnecessarily spend millions on buying unique domain names.
