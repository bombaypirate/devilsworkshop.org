Mozilla is trying to [encourage more internet users to become familiar with HTML][1]. Honestly, learning HTML is not really very difficult and anyone who creates content online through blogs should ideally try to learn atleast a little bit of it.

Often people are stuck with what sort of HTML editor they should use on their computers. Also questions are there on if these editors will be compatible with the OS of your computer.

For starters, Mozilla has a nice web app called Thimble which allows users to type in the HTML code in an editor and see the changes immediately.

## Thimble Features

  * The web app is compatible on most modern browsers and not just Firefox.
  * Thimble has the text editor on the left hand side and the changes are shown in real-time on the right hand side of the browser.
  * You can also publish your HTML content and share it with friends with via a URL. It also has easy options on sharing it across Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

If you are new to HTML and a beginner, I would recommend starting with Mozilla Thimble. Try it out and do drop in your comments.
