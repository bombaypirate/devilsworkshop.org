Sharing your desktop online with a friend is a great way to troubleshoot a technical issue. [Chrome has a nice app that allows sharing of desktops][1] using only the browser. Google seems to like the idea of people sharing desktops screens and it even has this feature on Google+.

Sharing your computer screen with friends is useful but with Google+ it can be done with many people at the same time.

### Share Screen on Google+ Hangouts

  * Start a Hangout session from your Google+ account and invite your friends to be a part of it.
  * Now at the top you can see an option that reads &#8220;Screenshare&#8221;. Click on it and you will get a popup of all the windows you have open on your computer.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-hangouts-share-desktop-screen-friends/gplus_hangouts_screen/" rel="attachment wp-att-56919"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56919" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="gplus_hangouts_screen" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/gplus_hangouts_screen.png" alt="" width="710" height="401" /></a>

Now select the window and the screen is shared. This works only to share screen and not give or take control of a desktop. For that the previously mentioned Chrome app is necessary.

Hangouts is a great online tool for video chatting in groups. But allowing screenshare actually makes it into more of a teaching tool. For example someone can share a quick draft of the post he is working on to get ideas in realtime from their Google+ friends.

I do not think this is a new feature but just simply not very popular, even though Hangouts is quite popular.Â Do drop in your comments.
