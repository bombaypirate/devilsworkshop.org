<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/stats-youtube-4billion-views/youtube_logo-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-49018"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-49018" title="youtube_logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/12/youtube_logo2.png" alt="" width="240" height="96" /></a>YouTube has made a few changes over the past year, with its [new design][1] and better social media integration. Some users were unhappy but it seems the changes have brought about some positives for YouTube.

According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/23/us-google-youtube-idUSTRE80M0TS20120123" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/23/us-google-youtube-idUSTRE80M0TS20120123', 'Reuters']);" >Reuters</a>, YouTube has reach the milestone of 4 Billion videos views per day. That is 25% up since data from May 2011.  The number is truly mind-boggling, as it means that every hour 166 millions videos views take place. That does mean more than 46,000 videos views per second.

### Other YouTube Statistics

  * 10% of videos on YouTube are available in HD.
  * Over 48 hours of video are uploaded on YouTube every minute.
  * Mobiles users account for 400 million views on YouTube.
  * 500 tweets on Twitter link to a video on YouTube every minute.

### YouTube Monetization problems

Also 3 billion videos are monetized per week. That means less than 1/10th of the videos watched on YouTube are making money.

YouTube has been one of Google’s great successes but at the moment it is not making any real money for Google. But as bandwidth grows across the world, online streaming could possibly replace television over the next decade. This puts YouTube in a great place.
