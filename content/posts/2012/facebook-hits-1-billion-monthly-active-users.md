This means that one billion accounts on Facebook are used actively in a single month.

Only last year, [Facebook was reported to have 800 million active users][2]. That is a incredibly strong growth.

[Google+ also reported touching the mark of 100 million monthly active users][3] but that pretty much shows the size of Facebook. It see atleast 10 times more activity on it.
