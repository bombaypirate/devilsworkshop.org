][1]broadcasting live videos on to your Facebook, they&#8217;ve got you covered &#8211; Broadcast For Friends, their new iPhone app let&#8217;s you do just that.

Apparently, this app is one of its kind, aiming to make live video broadcasting dead simple. To get started, you need the iPhone app (which is still not released for public), and authorize it through your Facebook account.

Your live video can be public or just restricted to your friends. Just after you stop broadcasting the video, a copy of it gets saved on to Facebook which can be handy.

The app also lets you add filters to the video you&#8217;re broadcasting, there are over ten of them. Your friends&#8217; likes and comments pop up on your phone, in real-time.

You can broadcast your video either through Wi-Fi or even 3G, and you don&#8217;t need any Ustream account to do so.

So, if you use an iPhone, head on to the launch page where you can signup to get notified when the app is launched.
