Very early on when I joined Devils&#8217; Workshop, I came across Gautam Gupta who was writing guest posts for us. I was surprised to find out that he was still in school. That was not all he, was also a pretty good programmer and even wrote a [PHP Tutorial series for Beginners][1].

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/gautam-gupta-ranked-5-google-code/gautam_gupta_5th_google_code_in/" rel="attachment wp-att-36594"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-36594" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Gautam Gupta" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2011/01/Gautam_Gupta_5th_Google_Code_in.png" alt="" width="342" height="353" /></a>

He won at the [Google Code-in 2o11, at the young age of 15][2], which gave him the oppurtunity to visit Google&#8217;s Mountain View Headquarters in California, USA.

He won at [Google Code-in again this year][3] and will leave for another trip to Google&#8217;s campus in a few days. Before he did that, I thought of catching up on him about his journey so far and what his plans are in the future.

**Q: Tell us a bit about yourself?**

I am Gautam, a 16 year old, XIth grader, geek, obsessed with coding and photography. Anything related to technology interests me, whether it be creating a small bot or open source projects like WordPress or artificial intelligence.

**Q: How did you start getting interesting in programming?**

I started programming way back in seventh grade by writing some bots in Visual Basic (Orkut bots, if someone remembers them :P) after reading some tutorials online and then trying out new things mainly related to hacking. Eventually I got into PHP and have been programming in it since then.

**Q: How did your participation in Google Code-In come about?**

Google Code-in has been one of the most impactful experiences of my life, letting me know my potential and connecting to some of the greatest people in the field. I am now in contact with so many which wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the platform that I got.

I have worked for about five open source organisations during the competition and completed about 75 tasks ranging from programming to documentation to translations, winning hundreds of points and securing a position in the top ten both times. I also got to know about some technologies which were completely new to me and using them in real time.

**Q: How was it visiting Google Headquarters in Mountain View? Is it as good as some of the videos suggest online?**

Google Headquarters is more wonderful than the videos online. You see the Googleplex, but you donâ€™t get the feel. It is only when youâ€™re in the complex that you feel it for real.

We toured the whole complex, including the great big Android statue, Charlieâ€™s Cafe and the list goes on. We also met many wonderful people including Chris DiBona, Alan Eustace, Josh Bloch, Jeremy Allison. Overall, it was just awesome.

**Q: What attracted you to developing for WordPress?**

I have been introduced to WordPress three times, never got introduced to Joomla or Drupal. I created my first blog on wordpress.com when I was about 10 by copy pasting content from other blogs &#8211; didnâ€™t know that that was illegal &#8211; deleted it soon after getting bored. After a couple of years, got introduced to it again from a friend on Orkut running a self-hosted blog and it was then I got to know that WordPress was an open-source software.

But I still was only into Visual Basic back then. The third time, I got involved with a blog on Orkut called OrkutPlus which ran on WordPress too, for which I contributed by creating scripts and blogging.

I didnâ€™t start developing directly for WordPress, rather with bbPress &#8211; I was setting up forums for OrkutPlus and decided to port a WordPress plugin SexyBookmarks as bbPress plugin Social It and then moved on to WordPress with time.

**Q. You are not just a techie, you also contribute time for a NGO. Tell us a bit about that part of your life?**

Yes, thatâ€™s right. Iâ€™m one of the co-founders of an organization named Discover I, where we tap the hidden talent of the underprivileged children, for example dancing, singing, computers and other co-curricular activities. We associate them with teachers or students who are good in that field so that their creativity could come out too!

I particularly got excited about this as I always wanted to do something for the society and when some of my friends came up with this idea to open up a NGO, I quickly agreed and became a part.

**Q. What are your plans for the future?**

As an XIth standard student, I currently have plans to prepare for engineering institutions in India and give SAT for the universities in the United States, following which I see myself as a founder of a tech startup in India being covered on Devilsâ€™ Workshop. ðŸ˜€

*Thanks for your time and here is wishing you all the very best from everyone at Devils&#8217; Workshop. WeÂ are incredibly proud of your achievements at such a young age and may you keep doing awesome things in the future. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />*
