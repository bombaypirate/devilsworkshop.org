Web designers spend a lot of time looking up different fonts on their website that can be used. Fonts are very important for two reasons. First is that a good font allows users to read content on the website without any issue. Also the font styling usually should also fit in with the general theme of the website.

If you are using Chrome, Google Font Previewer looks like a great extension. It allows the user to look up different fonts and styling on the website you are viewing on your browser.

### Google Font Previewer Features
