He can be quoted as saying

> Facebook is pretty uniquely positioned to answer the questions people have. At some point weâ€™ll do it. We have a team working on it.

Though there have always been rumours in the past that Facebook was getting into the search business. Facebook already handles 1 billion search queries, but it&#8217;s search features are hardly useful.

A Facebook search engine, could mean a lot more headaches to Google, which at the moment is not exactly setting the world on fire with Google+ in terms of popularity.

### Why a Facebook search engine makes sense?

Facebook is a social network where people connect, share updates, photos and videos. At best people use Facebook search for finding their friends or even trending topics.

For making money, Facebook will have to serve up results to questions like best local restaurants or shops. Facebook has all the data to know personalized data like that

This gives Facebook a great deal of data to give great search related results.

But it will work for Facebook, only if it gets search right and currently even Bing is not exactly gaining much ground against Google despite pouring in billions into it.
