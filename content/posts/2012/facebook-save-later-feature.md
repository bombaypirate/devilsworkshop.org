Facebook is testing a new feature which will allow users to bookmark updates or rather ‘Save’ them for reading later. <a href="http://www.imore.com/facebook-iphone-and-ipad-gain-new-save-later-feature" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imore.com/facebook-iphone-and-ipad-gain-new-save-later-feature', 'iMore reported']);" >iMore reported</a> first that the new “save for later” feature was showing up on iPhone and iPad apps for Facebook.

It makes sense of such a feature on Facebook, as one of the big issues of browsing through one’s Facebook feed is that there is often a information overload.<figure id="attachment_60350" style="width: 572px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Also even though Facebook is often called a social bookmarking website, but it really is not. Bookmarking does not just means sharing links and photos but actually getting back to them at a later time.

With Facebook usage becoming increasingly mobile or tablet based, it makes sense to have something like a ‘Save for later” feature. Online services like Instapaper are quite popular allows users to save links to read them later in a more tablet friendly format.

## “Save for Later” for Twitter

I recently wrote about saving all your shared links from Twitter and Facebook on Delicious automatically. But what about a “read later” feature for Twitter? I use this by marking interesting tweets I want to get back to by marking them as ‘favourites’. Then I subscribe to the [RSS feed of my favourite tweets][2] and I can get back to the really interesting tweets at a later time.

Have you seen this latest feature of “Save Later” on your Facebook account? Do drop in your comments and let me know.
