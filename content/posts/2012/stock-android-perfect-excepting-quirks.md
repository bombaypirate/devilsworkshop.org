Android during the Gingerbread phase was considered to be slow, laggy and badly designed. Ice Cream Sandwich changed that. All of that. Then came Jellybean, blowing everyone&#8217;s mind with Google Now.

Now here&#8217;s the thing, though the actual or stock versions of ICS and Jellybean are good, the skinned versions like Touchwiz, Sense or Motoblur are just inferior. Recently, I&#8217;ve got a Galaxy Nexus for myself, which is now running 4.1.1 and here&#8217;s how the software experience compares to the skinned versions of Android.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-68059" title="Stock Android" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/Jellybean-copy-345x600.png" alt="stock-android" width="345" height="600" />][1]

## Interface

Until ICS, Google never cared much about interface in Android. With ICS, they have introduced Roboto &#8211; a clean new typeface, new UI concepts like Holo, UI transitions and all.

Jellybean, on the other hand, was about polishing ICS rather than making a whole new version of Android.

To add to this, there are an increasing number of apps on Playstore which stick to Android&#8217;s design guidelines. Quora, TED, Pocket and many others &#8211; the list is just too big. All this make up to an OS with a unified interface &#8211; you&#8217;ll understand why this is important if you&#8217;ve ever used iOS or WP.

Pretty much all the skinned versions of Android change the look and feel of the OS and most often, they make it ugly. Or else, I&#8217;ll put it like this &#8211; the Metro and Desktop UI in Windows 8 never mix and the switch is never smooth. Likewise, in skinned Android, the Touchwiz/Sense over Holo UI looks totally out of place.

## Faster & Smoother

In Jellybean, you can see that, Project butter and triple buffering did make a difference in smoothness of OS.



Here I&#8217;m not saying Touchwiz is laggy on Galaxy S3 or that Sense is slow on One X. They are indeed snappy, but that&#8217;s only on the high-end phones. Use any of the mid-range Android devices, be it the Xperia, Galaxy or other smartphone series and you&#8217;ll know how degraded the user experience is.

Nexus S, on the other hand, has hardware on par with many mid-range Android devices and is very responsive. That&#8217;s simply because there is no extra UI layer in Nexus S, it&#8217;s just pure Android.

## OS Updates

Almost an year back, Samsung announced that there will be no ICS update for Galaxy S, one of their flagship phones at that time. Their explanation was that, Galaxy S doesn&#8217;t have enough RAM to run ICS along with Touchwiz.

Android 4.2 is going to release on November 14th and less than 3% of Android devices run the current version i.e. Jellybean.

Nexus handsets are the only exception for this problem &#8211; Nexus One for example had support till Gingerbread (starting with Eclair). Nexus S is still supported by Google and I won&#8217;t be surprised if it gets the 4.2 update too.

Ultimately, if you really can&#8217;t wait for OS updates, Nexus series is your best bet.

## Bloatware

I had a HTC One V previously, which had a paltry 4GB internal memory. It had insane amount of preinstalled apps including 7Digital, SoundHound, Flickr, Facebook for HTC Sense and much more. Because it was running ICS, I could just disable these apps. Still, that doesn&#8217;t remove them from memory, anyway.

Touchwiz phones are no exception, sometimes the situation is more awkward &#8211; for example, Galaxy S3 running Jellybean will have two voice assistants &#8211; Google Now and S Voice.

## It&#8217;s not all gold, anyway

While there are many advantages with stock Android, there are a few cons too.

Firstly, Android itself isn&#8217;t a &#8216;complete&#8217; OS. It lacks a few basic things &#8211; a &#8216;Notes&#8217; app for example. That&#8217;s something very basic. I myself use 3rd party apps for notes, but there is an obvious need for an inbuilt notes app.

There is no FM radio app. Or even a file manager. Or smart dialling. This is not a problem for someone like me who mostly relies on alternatives, but ideally, they should built-in.

Skinned versions of Android generally fix most of these issues. But, from what I can say, Google will look into these in the coming iterations of Android (Love how they&#8217;re bringing quick settings in 4.2 borrowing from Touchwiz).

Do you own a Nexus? Or are you sporting an AOSP ROM? Tell us what you think about it.
