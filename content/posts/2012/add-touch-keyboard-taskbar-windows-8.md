Windows 8 has two types of keyboards inbuilt into it, one is the Onscreen keyboard and other is **Touch keyboard**. Onscreen keyboard is the more or less the same as in Windows 7 but Touch keyboard is a new feature in Windows 8

Touch keyboard in Windows 8 has been designed to deliver a no compromise experience. It has not been only optimized for fingers, but is also well built for using via mouse. The new keyboard has been designed in such a way that it meets the needs of user and works well with various form factors.

Launching the Touch keyboard is a bit of a task as it does not appear in Search results. So here I am, with a tutorial on how to pin the new Touch Keyboard in Windows 8 Taskbar for quick access.

  * First of all switch to the Desktop by clicking on the Desktop tile on the Start Screen.

  * Here you need to right click on the **Taskbar** and select the **Toolbars** option.

  * Once you take your mouse to the Toolbars option, a new menu will appear. Now all you need to do is to select **Touch keyboard** from the list, which is at the 3rd postion from the top.

As soon as you select the Touch keyboard option, a keyboard like icon will appear on the right side of the taskbar. That&#8217;s it.To launch the Touch keyboard, all you need to do is click on that icon.

Touch keyboards are very handy for tablet users or even desktop/laptops with touch screens, which Windows 8 will support. Also for non-touch screen, it would be useful if the keyboard is not functioning.
