A couple of days ago, I wrote about using [Bufferapp to schedule your tweets automatically at pre-assigned timings][1]. This allows users to not come across as spamming and also send tweets when they think their users are most likely to read them.

For example if I have a lot of followers living in India, it would be better to send out tweets during the daytime in India.

If you are looking for the best timings to get the highest amount of exposure to your twitter account then try out <a href="http://www.tweriod.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tweriod.com/', 'Tweriod']);" >Tweriod</a>.

  * Just sign up with Tweriod with your Twitter account and wait for a while as it prepares your report. You can then get your report via email or even a DM on Twitter.
  * The analysis is based on retweets and replies on your account. It shows the best timings during weekdays, Mondays, Sundays and also Weekends in general.
  * A good idea would be to use these timings on your Buffer account to get the best out of both services.
  * On the downside, analysis can be updated only once a month, but that is good enough as most users would want one month data to actually decently accurate best timings for scheduling tweets.

You can also read up on [Timely which gives you best timings based on your last 199 tweets][3].

Do you schedule tweets? What are the strategies that your use? Do drop in your comments.
