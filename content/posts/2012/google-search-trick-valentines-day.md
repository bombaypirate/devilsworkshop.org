Remember the simple trick of typing in this [query ‘Do a Barrel Roll’][1] and the entire results page on Google turned upside down and back again. Well this Valentine’s Day, someone has figured out a way to enter a mathematical equation and get a graphical output which is heart shaped.

### The Equation to Google’s Heart!

Just enter the following equation into <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=sqrt(cos(x))*cos(300x)%2Bsqrt(abs(x))-0.7)*(4-x*x)%5E0.01%2C+sqrt(6-x%5E2)%2C+-sqrt(6-x%5E2)+from+-4.5+to+4.5" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.co.in/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=sqrt(cos(x))*cos(300x)%2Bsqrt(abs(x))-0.7)*(4-x*x)%5E0.01%2C+sqrt(6-x%5E2)%2C+-sqrt(6-x%5E2)+from+-4.5+to+4.5', 'Google Search']);" >Google Search</a> and hit the search button.

> sqrt(cos(x))\*cos(300x)+sqrt(abs(x))-0.7)\*(4-x*x)^0.01, sqrt(6-x^2), -sqrt(6-x^2) from -4.5 to 4.5

The equation is translated into a Graph which shows up in the shape of a heart. This feature is not a very well known feature of Google. You can check out more such [Google search features here][3].

Google does have some weird Easter eggs, but this was probably not the doing of a Google programmer. If you play around the values in the equation, the output starts to change. So someone must have figured out a way to create this hear shaped design with the right values.

If you liked this post, you might also like reading [Google Search for Hackers, Pirates and Klingons][4]. Do you know of any other Google queries which give interesting results? Do drop in your comments.
