Internet Explorer has steadily lost out in¬†the battle of the browsers. Yes, it is still the most used browser but that is mainly because it is the default browser on the most popular Operating System. [Chrome in recent years has become increasingly popular][1] and the general reputation of Internet Explorer has taken a nose dive over the past few years..

Microsoft has finally accepted this fact and calls Internet Explorer &#8220;<a href="http://browseryoulovedtohate.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://browseryoulovedtohate.com/', 'The Browser You Loved to Hate']);" >The Browser You Loved to Hate</a>&#8220;. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

While accepting their previous versions were not up to the mark, they are pitching Internet Explorer 9 as a decent browser.

### Microsoft&#8217;s New Advertisement for Internet Explorer 9

Microsoft has a new Ad poking fun at a guy who hated Internet Explorer all his life but now has become a fan of new Internet Explorer 9. The advertisement is pretty bad and not really funny enough. I think it might actually make more people avoid the browser than use it (See video below).



There are some gems in Internet Explorer 9 like pinning a website to the taskbar which cannot be done with Chrome or Firefox. But Chrome and Firefox does allow making applications of a website which can be pinned to the Windows Taskbar. üòâ

What are your views on Internet Epxlorer 9? Have you checked it out? Do you find yourself quitting Chrome or Firefox? Also what did your think about that advertisement by Microsoft? Do drop in your comments.
