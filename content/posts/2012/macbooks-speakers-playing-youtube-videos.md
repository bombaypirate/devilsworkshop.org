Speakers are probably the most annoying thing in Macbooks, they&#8217;re just too low in sound, even if you set the volume to maximum. This happens mainly when you play YouTube videos in browser, but fortunately, there&#8217;s a simple solution for this.

Firstly, if you can afford to spend a few dollars, you can get <a href="http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/', 'Boom']);" >Boom</a> &#8211; an app that&#8217;ll increase the volume level of your Macbook drastically and that works system wide, not just for YouTube videos.

[<img role="img" class="wp-image-62561" title="Using MplayerX to play YouTube videos" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/Mplayerx-600x375.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="375" />][1]

You can also solve this without spending any bucks, follow the below tutorial.

  * Get <a href="http://mplayerx.org/download.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mplayerx.org/download.html', 'MplayerX for Mac']);" >MplayerX for Mac</a>, this is a native video player for OS X.
  * Install and open it.
  * In the menu bar, hit File > Open URL. Paste the URL of the YouTube video you want to play.
  * Now you can set the volume for the video (in the app) to a higher level than what Mac actually provides.

Apparently, VLC had this option since a long time, but after the recent update this feature <a href="http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=89164" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=89164', 'seems to be broken']);" >seems to be broken</a>. So I gave MplayerX a try and was pretty satisfied with the results.[
