Microsoft might have decided to [dump the word “Metro”][1] to describe the UI for Windows but they have remained loyal to the design philosophy in the new minimalist looking logo for Microsoft.

The new logo is a lot more simpler and stylish from its previous iteration.

[<img class="alignnone  wp-image-61094" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Microsoft New Logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/08/Microsoft_New_Old_logo.png" alt="Microsoft New Logo" width="436" height="331" />][2]

The new logo for Microsoft was not surprising as it has rolled out new branding exercise for many of its products. The biggest being a [new single coloured Windows logo][3].

Here is a video below which shows how Microsoft has brought about the new logos which have similar style for Microsoft, Windows 8, Office and Xbox.
