Google+ was started with a lot of hope by web giant Google. It was supposed to be an alternative to Facebook and Google had finally managed to get social right. According to this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204653604577249341403742390.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204653604577249341403742390.html', 'report by WSJ']);" >report by WSJ</a>, Google+ might be dying because users are simply not spending any significant time on it. The report shows that a user spends on an average only 3 minutes per month on Google+.

Note surprisingly Facebook leads with a incredible 405 minutes per visitor. Even MySpace seems to get users to spend more time on it than Google+.

Google+ has a lot of users who have signed up and chances are [that it will reach 400 million users by the end of this year][1]. That said Google+ does not have a single feature which is extremely popular. Yes, there is hangouts which is a great innovation but even some new Google+ users are not aware of Hangouts.

What are your views about the future of Google+? Has Google embarked on a yet another social networking failure? Do drop in your comments.
