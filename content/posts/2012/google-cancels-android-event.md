A few days ago, Google had started sending out invites for a [special Android event, scheduled for the 29th of October][1]. The event was to be held in New York. According to <a href="http://marketingland.com/hurricane-sandy-causes-google-to-cancel-its-android-event-25134" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://marketingland.com/hurricane-sandy-causes-google-to-cancel-its-android-event-25134', 'confirmation by Marketing Land']);" >confirmation by Marketing Land</a>, Google has cancelled the 29th October Android event. The event was cancelled because of Hurricane Sandy. The storm is supposed to hit New York over the next day.

Google at the moment has not yet announced a new date or venue for the event.

The event was supposed to show case a LG Nexus 4 phone and a 10 inch tablet called Nexus 10 by Samsung. There were rumour about a new variant of Nexus 7 with 32GB memory and 3G compatibility.

Also the most important part of this event would have been the announcement of Android 4.2 (possibly called Key Lime Pie). Here is a [list of the expected features of Android 4.2][3].
