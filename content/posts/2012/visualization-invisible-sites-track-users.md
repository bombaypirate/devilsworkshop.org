Do you know that when your browser connects to a particular, it can also connect to other invisible sites which users have no idea about. For example, Facebook runs its Javascripts of another domain which is *fbcdn.net*.

Sometimes these invisible sites also track your usage and store information about your browsing activity. Collusion is a handy Chrome and Firefox extension which helps users check if the sites they are visiting are also connecting to other invisible sites.

Just install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/collusion-for-chrome/ganlifbpkcplnldliibcbegplfmcfigp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/collusion-for-chrome/ganlifbpkcplnldliibcbegplfmcfigp', 'Collusion extension for Chrome']);" >Collusion extension for Chrome</a> and start surfing. The collusion icon shows the number of sites that are informed from the page you are viewing.

The sites with a red circle are the advertisers while the grey circles connecting are usually social media sites.

Not all invisible sites which are informed about a visitor are dangerous. Most of them are not. For example most blogs will inform Google Analytics about a visitor.

If user clicks on ***“Block known tracking sites” ***the extension then shows which advertisers are known trackers and are blocked. They are displayed in the visualization with a blocked symbol.
