Today, exactly a year ago the Indian Cricket team won the World Cup. I thought about that glorious day from a year ago and wondered what sort of social update or photos did I share a year ago? Searching for your Tweets, Facebook updates or photos shared on Instagram can be tedious if not downright frustrating.

<a href="http://timehop.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://timehop.com', 'Timehop']);" >Timehop</a> is an internet service that sends you email updates everyday with what you shared on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Four Square.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/snapshot-social-media-life-year/timehop_yearago_social/" rel="attachment wp-att-56660"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56660" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="timehop_yearago_social" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/timehop_yearago_social.png" alt="" width="600" height="386" /></a>

Sign up with your Facebook account on ***Timehop.com*** and also link your other account on social networks like Twitter, Foursquare and Instagram.

Timehop will put togeather all that you shared on these linked accounts from exactly a year ago. This information is sent to you via an email. This email will be the same one you use for your Facebook account, which you have linked to Timehop.

Additionally ***Timehop*** also sends interesting global news and events in the email update, which happened exactly a year ago. I find this a great way to relive some interesting updates and photos we shared on social media websites.

Do drop in your comments.
