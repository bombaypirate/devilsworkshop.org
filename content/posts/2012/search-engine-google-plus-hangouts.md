Google+ might not have made a big dent in the social media niche but it has a popular feature in Hangouts. Hangouts allow small groups to conduct video chat online. There are many Hangouts which are very informative and it would be great to catch up on a few.

***GPHangouts.com*** is a website that is like a search service and directory for public Hangouts.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/search-engine-google-plus-hangouts/search_googleplus_hangouts/" rel="attachment wp-att-56626"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-56626" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Search_Googleplus_Hangouts" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/Search_Googleplus_Hangouts.png" alt="" width="877" height="345" /></a>

For instance I searched for WordPress related hangouts and straight away I got a link to a public Hangout.

A lot of users also tend to schedule public Hangout sessions and add them to the website&#8217;s directory. To schedule a Hangout session on the directory, users need to use their Google ID to sign in. I guess this is insurance against spammers who might schedule fake Hangouts.

Users can even search on Google+ for current Hangouts which are happening. But there is not option to schedule Hangouts.

Try out GPHangouts and drop in your comments.
