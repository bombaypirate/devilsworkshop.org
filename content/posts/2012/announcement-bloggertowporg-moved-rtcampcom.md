The birth of the idea behind rtCamp can be traced back more or less to the time when DW migrated from being a Blogger.com to self-hosted WordPress blog. One of the first services we started offering was helping people migrate their blogs from Blogger to WordPress.

Back in 2010, we created a [dedicated portal BloggerToWp.org][2] for helping out bloggers in a streamlined manner. But as our company grew bigger, we ended up creating more portals dedicated for several new services and products. It became difficult to maintain so many portals and thus we launched a <a href="http://rtcamp.com/news/rtcamp-redesigned-reimagined/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/news/rtcamp-redesigned-reimagined/', 'new project to merge all the different portals into a single website']);" >new project to merge all the different portals into a single website</a>.

Today, we have merged ***BloggerToWp.org*** into our corporate website <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blogger-to-wordpress/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blogger-to-wordpress/', 'rtCamp.com/blogger-to-wordpress/']);" ><strong>rtCamp.com/blogger-to-wordpress/</strong></a>.

### Additional Resources:
