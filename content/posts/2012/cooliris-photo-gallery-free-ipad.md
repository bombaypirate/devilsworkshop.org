Over two years ago, I was very impressed by the [Cooliris photo wall browser extension for Chrome][1]. It shows up your photos from various social media accounts in a layout that mimics a 3D wall.<figure id="attachment_60115" style="width: 550px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Cooliris also has worked Gallery for Android app, which now has ended up being the current default photo gallery on Android. Cooliris is now targeting iPad and iPhone users with a shiny new photo viewing and sharing app.

### Cooliris for iPhones / iPads

  * The app allows users to look through their photos on Facebook, iPad/iPhone photos and Instagram in their trademark 3D wall layout.
  * The photos can also be shared privately from the app.
  * The app allows unlimited and free photo uploads.
  * The web search for images is powered by Google Image search.

I loved the Cooliris 3D wall layout on my browser. But moving through it with the help of a mouse or keys is not as intuitive as it is with a tablet device like iPad.

If you are doing a lot of photo browsing and sharing from your iPads then Cooliris looks like a great app.

**UPDATE:Â **The 2.2 version of the app released recently also integrates with Google Drive. It also uses a new image recognition feature that works on Google Drive photos. It does not require users to manually tag the photos from Google Drive.
