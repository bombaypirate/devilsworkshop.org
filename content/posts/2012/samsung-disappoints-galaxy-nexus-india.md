When Google introduced the Galaxy Nexus which was the first phone with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), most experts thought that it would be only a matter of time before it was released in India. Google even showed a [landing page for registering for the Galaxy Nexus][1]Â for India.

Samsung India has decided that they are not going to release Galaxy Nexus in India at all. They did not announce this through any official announcement but while <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Samsung_India/status/197663452276326400" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/#!/Samsung_India/status/197663452276326400', 'replying to a tweet by Amit Wagh']);" >replying to a tweet by Amit Wagh</a>.

I am quite surprised by this latest announcement by Samsung, as the Galaxy range does have a decent fan base in India. At the moment Samsung is not winning many fans in India, especially the ones who wanted a phone running on Andriod 4.0 (ICS). Also a lot of existing Samsung models have not been updated to Android 4.0.

### Samsung Galaxy S III around the corner?

Samsung will in all probability announce a new phone in London at the <a href="http://www.thenextgalaxy.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenextgalaxy.com/', 'Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012']);" >Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012</a> event. The new phone in all probability will be Galaxy S III and that is probably the reason they are not going to split the buying public by introducing Galaxy Nexus in India.
