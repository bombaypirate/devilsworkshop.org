Ever since Nexus 7 tablet by ASUS was priced at almost Rs. 20,000, I for one lost interest in buying it. The price tag was almost double that of what it is available in India. Apple’s iPad Mini will soon be available in India for Rs. 21,900.

The prices of the iPad Mini in India will be INR 21,900 for the 16 GB Wi-Fi Model.

### How wrong is Nexus 7 pricing in India?

The [Asus Nexus 7 tablet in India is priced at INR 19,999][2] is not just over-priced but risks that potential buyers might just opt for Apple iPad Mini. The price difference is only 2,000/- and the **“Apple iPad”** brand name will surely find more takers.

Whoever came up with the pricing for India for the Nexus 7 for Asus, has probably ended up shooting itself in the foot.

Interestingly because if you are thinking of buying yourself a new iPod Touch in India, you might want to think again. The iPad is taxed at 5% and iPod at 13.5%, which means the price of iPod Touch in India could end up higher than the iPad Mini.
