This year we have seen two of the popular E-mail clients getting redesigned &#8211; [Microsoft brought life to Outlook][1] with Metro-esque approach to mail, Yahoo Mail got a cleaner look along with updates to mobile apps, soon after Marissa Mayer has become CEO.

Adding to this, AOL has now released a new E-mail client called Alto. Interestingly, it supports E-Mail accounts other than AOL Mail, which includes Gmail, Yahoo mail, and more.

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70002" alt="alto-aol-mail" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/12/Alto-1024x641.png" width="620" height="388" />][2]

The most highlighted thing in the app is Stacks &#8211; a feature which categorises your incoming E-mail into meaningful groups. So your Twitter/Facebook notifications E-mails are segregated from the daily deals E-mails from Amazon/eBay.

You can create custom Stacks and even make the incoming E-mail skip inbox and go right into that stack &#8211; so you have a more cleaner inbox.

It also has a [Boomerang-like feature][3] which lets you snooze an E-mail, so you can reply to it after a specified amount of time.

The interface looks clutter free and gives more of a desktop app like look, especially with features like two-column layout for reading E-mails, support for tabbed navigation.



I&#8217;m pretty sure it won&#8217;t grab many users from other web-based E-mail clients, but nevertheless, still worth a try.

Alto is still in beta, but you can sign up for an invite.
