After iPhone 5, Apple launched its latest tablet in India i.e. iPad Mini and iPad 4 a couple of days back. As expected; the product is out of stock but some websites still have them. Let&#8217;s have a look at the websites where you can get your iPad Mini in India and the best price for it. The official price for this tablet is 21,900 INR and you have to pay at least this amount to buy one. You can try coupon codes if you have them but [Great Online Shopping Festival][1] coupons are not applicable here.

### Websites, Price and Delivery Time:

**<a href="http://www.flipkart.com/apple-16gb-ipad-mini-wi-fi/p/itmdfwgjthu4feut?pid=TABDFWGG86GVKFRW" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flipkart.com/apple-16gb-ipad-mini-wi-fi/p/itmdfwgjthu4feut?pid=TABDFWGG86GVKFRW', 'Flipkart']);" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>: **Its one of the most popular e-commerce website of India. The price tag is same 21,900 but unfortunately this device is currently **out of stock** for the 16GB model in both the colors. You can go for a 32GB model which is **in stock** and will be delivered in 2-4 days.

**<a href="http://www.homeshop18.com/apple-ipad-mini-16gb-wifi/computer-peripherals/ipads-tablets/product:30409544/cid:8937/?pos=75%0A&utm_source=affilliate&utm_medium=OMG&utm_campaign=text" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.homeshop18.com/apple-ipad-mini-16gb-wifi/computer-peripherals/ipads-tablets/product:30409544/cid:8937/?pos=75%0A&utm_source=affilliate&utm_medium=OMG&utm_campaign=text', 'Homeshop18']);" target="_blank">Homeshop18</a>: **Search on Google about the online price of iPad mini in India and most of the websites will say that Homeshop18 is giving it for 19,400 INR, well that&#8217;s not true, the price is same on this website as well and the product is currently **out of stock**. Once it&#8217;s available, the website will take 5-6 days to deliver it to you. So it will be better if you order it from Flipkart.

<a href="http://www.snapdeal.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-with-wifi/592728?utm_source=omegatxn&utm_campaign=afts" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.snapdeal.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-with-wifi/592728?utm_source=omegatxn&utm_campaign=afts', 'Snapdeal']);" target="_blank"><strong>Snapdeal</strong></a>: Same official price, but it&#8217;s **out of stock** on this website.

<a href="http://www.mirchimart.com/Apple-IPad-Mini-16GB-WIFIWhite--Silver/iPads/p/URS8XMODM1HC1;jsessionid=BDE0CFA483A2F3171D388FE39BFAEABC.jvm1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mirchimart.com/Apple-IPad-Mini-16GB-WIFIWhite--Silver/iPads/p/URS8XMODM1HC1;jsessionid=BDE0CFA483A2F3171D388FE39BFAEABC.jvm1', 'MirchiMart']);" target="_blank"><strong>MirchiMart</strong></a>: Product is **in stock** here and the expected delivery time is 2-4 days. You can also use their EMI option (check the website for more details). This website is not very popular as compared to other Indian e-commerce website. May be that&#8217;s the reason why iPad Mini is available but since I have never ordered something from this website so I can&#8217;t tell you about the site. If you have ordered something then don&#8217;t forget to share your views with us. Price is same 21,900 for the basic model.

**<a href="http://www.saholic.com/tablets/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-16gb-1005157?afid=55" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.saholic.com/tablets/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-16gb-1005157?afid=55', 'Saholic']);" target="_blank">Saholic</a>: In stock** and the product will be delivered next day for Delhi and will take a couple of days for Mumbai. You can check the delivery time for other cities on their website. EMI option is also available here. Same price tag.

**<a href="http://www.tradus.com/apple-ipad-mini-16gb-white-silver/p/MOBMCQTCGOFCFKME?src=sr&cl=img&pos=2&filter=query:ipad%20mini_" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tradus.com/apple-ipad-mini-16gb-white-silver/p/MOBMCQTCGOFCFKME?src=sr&cl=img&pos=2&filter=query:ipad%20mini_', 'Tradus']);" target="_blank">Tradus</a>: In stock**, 3-5 days delivery time and it&#8217;s a popular website but still I won&#8217;t recommend it to you because of the price. You have to pay 25,999 for the basic model, so it&#8217;s better to buy a 32GB version from Flipkart than this 16GB model.

Please share your views about these websites or if you have already ordered an iPad online. Drop a comment below for any doubt. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
