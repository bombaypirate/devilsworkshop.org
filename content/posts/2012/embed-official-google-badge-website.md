Sometime ago, Google introduced Google+ Pages for brands to have some visibility on it. To encourage visibility, website owners could embed badges of their Google+ page but unfortunately it was not available for Google+ profiles from the beginning. I am sure some people do not want to create a Google+ page for their blog or website. This is being addressed recently by Google by introducing badges for personal accounts.

### Creating Badge for Google+ Personal Accounts

  * Every Google+ profile has a unique ID which is a 25-digit number. Copy it from your browser&#8217;s address bar.
  * Now visit this link and enter the profile ID as indicated in the image below.

<div>
  <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/embed-official-google-badge-website/google_plus_badge_personal/" rel="attachment wp-att-55467"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-55467" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Create Badge for Google+ Account" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/03/Google_plus_badge_personal.png" alt="" width="602" height="625" /></a></span>
</div>

  * If you are using WordPress as a blogging platform, adding this code into a widget would work fine.

<div>
  <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">Advantage of the this badge is quite simple. Your readers can add you directly into their Google+ Circles from your website itself. ðŸ˜‰</span>
</div>

If you are interesting is something similar, I would recommend using [the official Twitter follow button][1] which also helps create a code which can be posted in a widget just as easily.

Do try it out and drop in your comments.
