But getting extra space is not that difficult especially if you get a lot of your friends to signup as referrals. Usually each referral would get <del>500</del> 250 MB extra storage space.

Dropbox has <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=1096" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=1096', 'recently']);" >recently</a> doubled up the storage space for referrals from <del>500 MB to 1 GB</del> 250 MB to 500 MB.

I guess for cloud storage 2 GB is a lot but as many people like myself end up [storing photos on Dropbox][1], having extra space which is free does not hurt. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Just sign-in to your Dropbox account and share your referral link on Twitter, Facebook and also in your Email.

### Is this the Google Drive effect?

Dropbox might soon get a strong competition from Google. It is rumored that Google will launch its cloud storage service this April called Google Drive. Dropbox has the disadvantage of not having a captive audience but it has the advantage of not being platform oriented.

For example, I still know a lot of people using iPhones or iPads using Dropbox rather than iCloud. This is because they might have a laptop running on Windows which also is compatible with Dropbox.

If and when Google Drive is released, it will be interesting to see how things unravel between Dropbox and Google Drive. Do drop in your comments.
