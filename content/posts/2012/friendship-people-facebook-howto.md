Long time back Facebook introduced a feature by which you can see friendship between you and your friend. Later they extended it to see friendship between your friends but do you know that you can also use this to see friendship and mutual friends or likes between any two people on Facebook doesn&#8217;t matter if they are in your friend&#8217;s list or not? Let&#8217;s see how you can do this.

### How to see friendship between two people?

The basic link to see the friendship between two friends is this:

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sauravjit?and=aditya.kane" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/Sauravjit?and=aditya.kane', 'https://www.facebook.com/Sauravjit?and=aditya.kane']);" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/Sauravjit?and=aditya.kane</a>

where *Sauravjit* and *aditya.kane* are the usernames of me and my friend.

Now suppose that I want to see friendship between two people who are on Facebook but they are not friends say *profile.1* and *profile.2* (both are usernames of the respective profiles). For that I just have to replaceÂ *SauravjitÂ *withÂ *profile.1Â *andÂ *aditya.kaneÂ * withÂ *profile.2* and it will show friendship between the two.

### What is a username?

Username is a unique name or ID of every profile on Facebook. You can find anyone&#8217;s username on Facebook by opening his/her profile and see the link in address bar. The text after *www.facebook.com/* will be the username of that profile. For example the link of my profile is:

http://www.facebook.com/*Sauravjit* , so my username is *Sauravjit.*

### Use of checking friendship between two people?

Using this trick will help you if you want to see mutual friends or likes or even tagged photos between any two people on Facebook depending upon the privacy level of that profile.

If it&#8217;s not showing any data then either the friends/photos are locked or there is no mutual content between the two. I hope this trick will help some of our readers who love to check random profiles of friends. ðŸ˜‰
