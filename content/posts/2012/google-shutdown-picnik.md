If you are fans of Picnik, the online image editing tool, here is some bad news for you. Picnik will be shut-down from April 2012 onwards. Picnik made this <a href="http://blog.picnik.com/2012/01/official-announcement-picnik-is-closing/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.picnik.com/2012/01/official-announcement-picnik-is-closing/', 'announcement']);" >announcement</a> in its blog.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Picnik_closing" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/01/Picnik_closing_thumb.png" alt="Picnik_closing" width="570" height="339" border="0" />][1]

Picnik’s editing tools will still be available within Google+ images in the form of Creative Kit. But not all Picnik tools will be available. Even if Google does bring in all of Picnik’s image tools into Google+, that would mean users will need a Google+ account to use it.

A silver lining to Picnik closing down in April 2012 is that its premium features will be free to all users until it actually closes down.

I have always considered Picnik to be the best online tool for editing images. Picnik was bought by Google to improve its online image editing options. I was so impressed with this new acquisition from Google, that I wondered if [Google might use this along with Picasa to challenge Flickr][2].

### Google’s Clean up act

I guess this is part of Google’s clean-up act which has seen a host of not so popular products being canned. It first [shutdown a host of services in September 2011][3] which included Google Toolbar and Aardvark. The in November 2011, it [shutdown even more services][4] like Google Friend Connect, Google Wave, Google Gears and others.

Usually most of these shutdown announcement have included more than just one or two services and I guess we might wait for a couple of days to see if Google will be phasing out more services.
