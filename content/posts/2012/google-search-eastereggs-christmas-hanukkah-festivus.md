Google is well known for inserting some interesting Easter eggs in their search results. During the current festival season, they have introduced three different Easter eggs. If you search for terms like “Christmas”, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah', 'Hanukkah']);" >Hanukkah</a>” and “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus', 'Festivus']);" >Festivus</a>”

This is not the first time Google has included Easter-eggs in their search results. Previously users have unearthed a [Google query that would display a heart shape graphical design][1]. That one was very popular on Valentine’s day.

Another famous one was “[Do a Barell Roll” easter egg][2] that would mimic a video game’s manoeuvre of the entire search results page on Google.

Last by not the least Google has supports [search landing pages for hackers, klingons and pirates][3].
