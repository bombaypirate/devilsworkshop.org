As some of you might have noticed, our Devils&#8217; workshop got a new logo & design. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Last time we [redesigned DW was almost 2 years back][1]. In 2 years, WordPress has evolved so much that  we couldn&#8217;t keep updating DW theme at faster pace. We have too many sites in our network and separately updating each for latest WordPress features was a tough job.

But with this new theme, we are moving all our sites to our new open-source theme framework &#8211; <a href="http://rtpanel.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtpanel.com/', 'rtPanel']);" >rtPanel</a>. This and all future themes will be developed as a <a href="http://rtpanel.com/2011/10/14/child-theme-rtpanel/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtpanel.com/2011/10/14/child-theme-rtpanel/', 'rtPanel&#8217;s child theme']);" >rtPanel&#8217;s child theme</a>. This means if we add a new feature into rtPanel framework, it will be available into all rtPanel&#8217;s child themes *(unless somebody abused child-theme development guidelines!)*

## New Design, New Goals!

With this new design, we have some new goals. A lot is changing about the way we operate DW. Some of changes might be shocking!

#### LESS Advertising:

DW will use Google-AdSense only for now onwards. If we decide to consider other ad-network, it will be <a href="http://buysellads.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://buysellads.com/', 'BuySellAds']);" >BuySellAds</a>. Apart from AdSense, we will only consider [direct Banner-Ads sales][2].

We have made some decent money from Technorati, Kontera and some more networks, but these networks uses blocking-javascript which degrades performance of our pages. So we are bidding adieu to all of them!

#### LESS Social (networking):

We have decided to show social icons on single-posts only. No more cluttering archive pages with literally 10&#8217;s of social-icons!

For small-social stuff we decided to keep here, we will use our own <a href="http://rtpanel.com/2011/10/14/releasing-rtsocial-plugin/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtpanel.com/2011/10/14/releasing-rtsocial-plugin/', 'rtSocial plugin']);" >rtSocial plugin</a>. rtSocial is very low on resources and while developing this theme, we found few more ways to optimize it in future release!

Going *anti-social* will personally help me focus more on content-part and also community of guest-bloggers & readers here.

#### MORE (Quality) Content:

The moment we removed ad-networks which were bloating this site, I realized that we no longer run DW to make money only!

Once slow-loading ads were thrown out, next target is poor content!  We are working on streamlining work-flow for guest-bloggers to make it easy for them to contribute to DW. This will raise quality-bar of posts here IMHO.

#### MORE Community Oriented:

We will be bringing back long-abandoned DW support forum back. Support forum will help us answer reader questions as well as questions from guest-bloggers. We will continue to answer questions on <a href="https://twitter.com/devils_workshop" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/devils_workshop', 'twitter']);" >twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/devilsworkshop.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/devilsworkshop.org', 'our facebook page']);" >our facebook page</a> but support forum will have highest priority.

We are also experimenting with some WordPress comments enhancement plugins. Integrating with third-party system like Disqus/IntenseDebate is also into consideration. The goal is to make it easy to comment here!

### Credits!

I already received few emails praising new DW logo. The credit for same goes to our design team lead <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000774921020" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000774921020', 'Sneha Mutha']);" >Sneha Mutha</a>. Sneha created a nice new design also, which is *slightly* different than what you are seeing here.

We coded many things on live DW server so that we can have first-hand experience of issues that other developers might be facing while working on rtPanel theme framework. Our senior developer <a href="https://github.com/joshuaabenazer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/joshuaabenazer', 'Joshua']);" >Joshua</a> with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/PrakashBhande" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/PrakashBhande', 'Prakash']);" >Prakash</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nitun.lanjewar" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/nitun.lanjewar', 'Nitun']);" >Nitun</a> will keep optimizing this new design till we don&#8217;t get it right!
