Aakash; a Made in In<span style="color: #000000;">dia <del>$35</del></span> $50 Android tablet just crossed a huge milestone with over 14 lakh (1.4 million) bookings in just 2 weeks. That means they are booking 1,00,000 tablets everyday according to Datawind, the manufacturers of Aakash Tablet PC. This booking is even much higher than the world&#8217;s first Tablet Apple&#8217;s iPad. Apple sold around 10 lakh iPadsÂ in the first 4 weeks.Â And since the demand for this $50 tablet is continuously increasing, so the Datawind is planning to set up 3 more manufacturing plants in India in Cochin, Noida and Hyderabad.

Well the only reason behind such huge demand is the price of this tablet. These days who&#8217;s owns a PC at home can easilyÂ affordÂ a Rs.2500 tablet but seriously this Tablet is not at all going to give anyÂ competitionÂ to any of the high-end Tablets like Apple&#8217;s iPad or Sansung Galaxy Tab. A person who&#8217;sÂ planningÂ to buy an iPad won&#8217;t drop his idea just because a $50 tablet is there in the market.
