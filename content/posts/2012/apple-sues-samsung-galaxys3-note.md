Apple has now amended a complaint in a U.S. district court in California, US to include Samsung Galaxy S 3 and Note devices for patent infringement. In other words it is suing Galaxy S3 and Note handsets for copying iPhone.

Apple has recently managed to win a patent case against Samsung in the US, where the [jury awarded Apple over $1 billion in damages][1]. Those handsets were older models from Samsung, which included the Galaxy S 2 handset.

Apple has managed to win or stall the release of older models of phones from Samsung with varying degree of success but it will be interesting to see if they will be able to block the sale of Galaxy S3 and Note phones in the U.S.

### What could be Apple’s game plan?

Apple’s iPhone 5 is only days away from being introduced. The phone will be the big ticket revenue earner for Apple, especially in the holiday season towards the end of the year.

With Samsung’s Galaxy S3 receiving a lot of positive reviews and also good sale numbers, it could possibly dent iPhone sale figures.

Even if Galaxy S3 is partially blocked from being sold during the crucial holiday season in the U.S, it would be very advantageous to Apple’s iPhone 5.

It seems the patent wars are far from over and have only begun. It will be interesting how Samsung reacts to this news. When the iPhone 5 is unveiled, it will most certainly get a lot of  attention from lawyers all around the world.
