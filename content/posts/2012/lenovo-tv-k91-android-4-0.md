After <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/08/lenovo-ideatv-letv-k91-android-ice-cream-sandwich/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/08/lenovo-ideatv-letv-k91-android-ice-cream-sandwich/', 'Google released Android 4.0 on a phone with the Galaxy Nexus']);" title="Galaxy Nexus opens registration in India">Google released Android 4.0 on a phone with the Galaxy Nexus</a>, it probably started getting a lot of phone makers interested in releasing a new phone or even a tablet that runs on Android 4.0.

It seems Lenovo has managed to go a step ahead and has created a TV set that runs on Android. Lenovo has named it K91.

### Lenovo K91 – First TV to run on Andorid 4.0 Features

  * The K91 TV is  called Smart TV and it will run on a dual core processor.
  * The TV will come with a 55-inch screen that supports 3D HD.
  * As it runs on Android it will also support Android apps that will make the TV set a lot more interactive. It will probably mean a Android phone could double up as a remote.
  * A really cool feature is a 5 megapixel camera which might be helpful for video conferencing or even locking the TV for children based on face recognition.

### The blurring line between gadgets…

Lenovo K91 is not the only smart tv that will be coming out this yet. Chances are Apple will unveil one and [Google TV will show off what it can do after last year’s launch][2].

It seems that the line between gadgets is blurring and basic use of computers is becoming merged. Email, browsing capabilities become common place for a TV set in the near future, then the end of desktop PC is probably a lot nearer than we thought before.
