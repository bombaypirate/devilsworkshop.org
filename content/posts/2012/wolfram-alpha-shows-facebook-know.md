Wolfram|Alpha, the impressive computational engine now can tell a lot about you by collecting data from your Facebook account. If you&#8217;re an over-sharer, it can get a little creepy too!

All you need is a Wolfram account and a Facebook account (obviously) and you&#8217;re good to go. Login to your Wolfram account, authenticate the app through Facebook and type &#8220;facebook report&#8221; in search box. It&#8217;ll take a bit of time depending on how much of your data is stored on Facebook.

You&#8217;ll get to see a lot of information like your most popular status, number of likes/comments, most contacted friends, your post frequency etc.

If you&#8217;re feeling a bit privacy deprived, note that Wolfram|Alpha will only store the data for one hour, deleting it afterwards. Also, you can always revoke apps through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications', 'Facebook app settings']);" >Facebook app settings</a>.

You can also download the page if you&#8217;ve subscribed to Wolfram|Alpha pro, which also unlocks a lot of features.
