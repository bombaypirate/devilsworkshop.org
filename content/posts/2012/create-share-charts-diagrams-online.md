Creating and sharing charts or diagrams online is a great way to collaborate while planning a project. Workflows and simple diagrams are great too but a impressive chart actually helps people understand a lot more in very little time. I have used [Lovely Charts][1] and even [Google drawings][2]. This time I tried out ***Creately.com***, which is a pretty decent one if you are comfortable creating diagrams or charts which are saved publicly.

### <a href="http://creately.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://creately.com', 'Creately']);" >Creately</a> Features

  * Creately allows free users to create and share charts and diagrams. Users can sign up with their Facebook, Twitter or Google accounts.
  * You can invite more collaborators to create the charts and also save your chart as an image.
  * I found that it has a huge directory of images or objects and pre-defined charts, flowcharts and even infographics, which really helps bring to life a chart.

The free version of Creately does have some limitations, mainly users can only save upto 5 diagrams at one point of time. Also saving the chart as an image is not possible without Createlyâ€™s watermark.

Do try out our Creately and drop in your comments.
