Microsoft had released Windows 8 for public last week and this time I found many people actually buying Windows instead of pirating it, which is a good thing.

As expected, many of these people who got their hands on Windows 8, have started raging about how Windows 8 is a step back in usability &#8211; mainly referring to lack of start menu.

Many of them even started installing 3rd party start menu replacements. Heck, Samsung is bundling it with their new Windows 8 laptops.

So is lack of start menu really a big problem? Here&#8217;s why it is not.

## Windows 8 search &#8211; it&#8217;s all there

The search in Windows 8 is hidden in the Charms bar &#8211; the bar that slides from right. But again, you don&#8217;t even need to wait for Charms bar to open &#8211; to start searching, all you need to do is, get on to the start screen and start typing. Can it get more easy than that? I don&#8217;t think so.

Browsing through apps in Windows 8 is much better than navigating through folders and menus in Windows 7&#8217;s start menu. Think of it like OS X&#8217;s launchpad, i.e. really good for checking out all the apps you&#8217;ve installed.<figure style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Not just that, all the run commands which worked in Windows 7&#8217;s start menu will work in Windows 8 too. For example, msconfig lets you add/remove startup programs, accessible through Windows 8&#8217;s search.<figure style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

If you&#8217;ve ever used OS X&#8217;s Spotlight feature, you know how slow searching files is, in Windows 7. Not anymore, Windows 8&#8217;s search is a considerable improvement, though not as fast as Spotlight, it&#8217;s much better than what it was previously.

## It&#8217;s all about making search universal

Windows 8&#8217;s search feature is not restricted to apps or settings or files. It&#8217;s built into *each and every* app on your OS. That opens for a lot of possibilties.

For example, I type &#8216;Hyderabad&#8217; in Search and hit the &#8216;AccuWeather&#8217; app &#8211; it starts showing the weather of Hyderabad immediately. If there was no universal search, I had to open the app, find the search bar, enter the query and get result. This is how Windows 8&#8217;s search turns a multi-step process into a considerably shorter one.<figure style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Windows 8 is a big change and it&#8217;ll take a bit of time for everyone to get used to. Installing a start menu replacement will only make it look like Windows 7, and you&#8217;ll never come to know the beauty of integrated/universal search.

What are your thoughts on Windows 8? Have you tried it? Put that in comments.
