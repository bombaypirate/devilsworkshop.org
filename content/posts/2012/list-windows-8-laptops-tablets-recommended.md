Yesterday I wrote a post on how to go about [upgrading your laptop or PC to Windows 8][1]. But that one was for people who already owned a computer and not for new buyers. There are many manufacturers who have already made Windows 8 laptops and tablets.

Keeping track of all the different devices running Windows 8 might seem like a difficult task but thankfully Microsoft has an official list. Just visit the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/tablets-convertibles" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/tablets-convertibles', 'Windows 8 Tablets & Convertibles']);" >Windows 8 Tablets & Convertibles</a> or <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/laptops" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/laptops', 'Windows 8 Laptops']);" >Windows 8 Laptops</a> pages to get a list of all Windows 8 devices.

The price, specs and availability of all the devices on Windows 8 is made available. ðŸ˜‰

### Use PC Selector to find suitable Windows 8 laptops and tablets:

Along with list of all devices, Microsoft also has a handy online tool called **<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/pc-selector" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/pc-selector', 'PC Selector']);" >PC Selector</a>** for users to device on what PC or Tablet will be best suitable for them. This one is mainly devised for people who are do not understand technical terms.

[<img class="alignnone  wp-image-67536" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Windows_Choose" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/10/Windows_Choose.png" alt="" width="546" height="238" />][3]

Users need to answer questions based on how much they use a computer and what exactly they use it for along with their desired budget. Based on that information the website suggests users the best Windows 8 PCs or tablets.

Are you planning to buy a new Windows 8 laptop or tablet? Do drop in which one you are planning to and why in your comments.
