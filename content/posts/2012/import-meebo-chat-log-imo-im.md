We had written about [alternatives to Meebo][3], among which ***imo.im*** is probably the most popular one. Thankfully, Meebo users can download their chat logs from their Meebo accounts.

Imo.im has a interesting option for Meebo users, they can import their  Meebo chat logs into imo.im. Just visit <a href="https://www.meebo.com/chatlog-download" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.meebo.com/chatlog-download', 'this link']);" >this link</a> and download your meebo chat logs on your computer.

Now sign-in to your imo.im account settings icon and access your preferences.

In preferences you will be able to see the import link. Click on it and import your chat logs from Meebo.

Make sure that you have linked the same accounts on imo.im which you had linked on Meebo.
