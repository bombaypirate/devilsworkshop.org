During last month Google I/O 2012 event, the Nexus7 tablet was introduced. At the moment the tablets are available in US, Canada and Australia. The tablet will in all probability be made available in India this September.

According to <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/google-nexus-7-tablet-to-hit-india-in-september/268961-11.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ibnlive.in.com/news/google-nexus-7-tablet-to-hit-india-in-september/268961-11.html', 'IBN-Live']);" >IBN-Live</a>, ASUS which manufacturers Nexus 7 for Google, has confirmed that the tablet will not be available in India before September.

A release before October would make sense as it would be before the festive season of Diwali, when shopping activity is at a yearly high.

## Pricing &#8211; Nexus7 Tablet in India

The tablet currently goes for $199 for 8 GB and $249 for the 16GB versions.

The price of Nexus 7 has not yet been confirmed by Asus in India but we should expect it to be on the lower side price wise.

If the tablet shows up around the Rs. 10,000 to 12,000 region, it will in all probability make big inroads into India, where enthusiasm about tablet devices is a bit low because of the cost.

### How will Google Play be promoted in India?

When Nexus 7 was launched and price revealed, it was clear that Google was not looking to make money from the sales for the device. They were more interested in having people buy movies, music and books from the Google Play.

It will be interesting to see if Google ties up with some of the media houses in India, to sell content for Indian users.

India is a big market for smartphones but that does not automatically translate to tablet sales like it has in US and Europe.

Ofcourse it could all end up being just a plan and Nexus 7 might not release in India at all like [they did with Galaxy Nexus][2].

If Nexus 7 is released in India, would you be lining up to buy it? Do drop in your comments.
