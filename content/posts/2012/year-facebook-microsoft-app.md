Facebook is a big constant in our online social media life. Your comments and interactions with your friends and family members on Facebook, often speaks a lot about you as a person. A ***&#8220;year in the Like&#8221;*** is a online app, that allows you to look back at a whole year on Facebook, taking into account your Likes, comments and photos you shared.

## &#8220;A Year in the Like&#8221; Features

  * Visit the website and allow the app to work with your Facebook account. I found it trustworthy in the sense it is a tool created by Microsoft.
  * Look through what sort of updates you want to look through and also who you want this app to be visible for among your friends.
  * Your comments and likes start to roll out with the background being an image that you might have shared. All comments and likes are clickable and if done to a particular image, it loads up that image as the background.
  * Finally users can also easily create a ready-made video of your comments and photos. This video can then be shared with your friends on Facebook or Twitter.
