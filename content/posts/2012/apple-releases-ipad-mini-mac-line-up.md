Just like the rumors have suggested, Apple has released a lot of shiny new stuff in its special event. They have introduced iPad mini, a smaller version of the original iPad. The Mac line-up is bigger than ever, with new iMacs, Mac minis, and a new retina 13&#8243; MacBook Pro.

## iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad

The iPad Mini as you&#8217;d expect, is a thinner, lighter and a smaller tablet. With the screen resolution same as that of the original iPad (which means no fragmentation). It&#8217;s got a 7.9&#8243; display, which will *hopefully* fit in your hands. It&#8217;s got a dual-core A5 chip, and supports the lightning connector instead of a Micro-USB. Available in both 3G as well as Wi-Fi only models.

The base 16GB Wi-Fi only model costs 329$, and the price increments by 100$ for extra storage.

Along with iPad mini, they&#8217;ve also updated the full-sized iPad with a new A6X chip. This is quite aÂ surprise, as it wasn&#8217;t mentioned in any of the rumors.

## 13&#8243; Retina MacBook Pro

The retina display finally comes to the 13&#8243; MacBook Pro with 227 PPI, along with incredibly fast flash storage, support for PowerNap feature, and of course, very thin and light in design.

It costs 1699$ for the base model, which comes with 2.5Ghz Intel core i5, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of flash storage. That&#8217;s like 500$ more than the non-retina base 13&#8243; MacBook Pro.

Though the flash storage and retina are tempting, I don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s worth it. Also, many of the Mac apps are yet to be optimized for retina. Another not-so-impressive factor is that, it&#8217;s got Intel HD Graphic 4000 as GPU, Apple should have considered Nvidia instead.

## Mac Mini and iMacs

Mac desktop enthusiasts finally got what they wanted &#8211; an update to iMacs and Mac minis. Though MacBooks got updated in this year&#8217;s WWDC, Apple didn&#8217;t talk anything about iMacs and Mac minis.

Both of these got the 3rd generation ivy bridge Intel processors, USB 3.0 ports and new Nvidia GeForce chips. iMacs have got a new display which has got anti-reflective coating, and is very thin.

The base models of iMac and Mac Mini costs $1299 and $799 respectively.

That&#8217;s a lot of Apple products in one single event. Are you looking forward to getting any of these? Do comment.
