  9to5Mac, a popular Apple-dedicated blog, has confirmed that the there&#8217;s going to be a release of retina version of the current 13&#8243; MacBook Pro.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  With iPhone, iPad and the recent 15&#8243; MacBook Pro going all retina, releasing a retina version of the 13&#8243; isn&#8217;t a big surprise.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  There aren&#8217;t much details about the laptop, except that it&#8217;s going to be thinner and lighter, just like the 15&#8243; retina MacBook Pro. It will be sold in two versions with varying processor and storage configurations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Apple has updated the 13&#8243; MacBook Pro lineup in this year&#8217;s WWDC &#8211; with ivy bridge processors, USB 3.0 and all, but the screen resolution was still the same. Heck, the 13&#8243; MacBook Air has better resolution than the 13&#8243; Pro. So a retina version is a big welcome.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The non retina version of 13&#8243; MacBook Pro will still be continued, as there will be a lot of people who don&#8217;t want to spend extra amount of money for the retina version.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Putting laptops aside, I wonder if iMacs get updated with retina, as they can be really pricey.
