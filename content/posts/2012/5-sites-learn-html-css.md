Recently, I’m on the verge of learning basic web designing. It all started with the idea of making a landing page for myself from scratch, without using sites like About.me. I ended up discovering sites which can be very handy for beginners who&#8217;re trying to code.[<img class="wp-image-60030" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="HTML5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/07/HTML5_thumb.png" alt="HTML5" width="240" height="240" align="right" border="0" />][1]

## 1. Codecademy

This is one of the best things I’ve stumbled upon this year. Codecademy is where you learn code by actually writing it, i.e. by completing exercises which are created by experts of those field. This year, they launched a <a href="http://codeyear.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://codeyear.com/', 'free initiative named Code Year']);" target="_blank">free initiative named Code Year</a>, calling everyone to learn the basics of coding.

The site lets you track progress, achieve badges and other cool stuff. If you’re stuck at some particular exercise, you can post your doubts in the forums, there are some helpful people out there! You can grab exercises related to Javascript, JQuery and of course CSS3. They also seem to add [lessons related to Python][2], in future. The best thing? All this is free.

## 2. Dochub

How about an instantly searchable documentation of all major programming languages? That’s Dochub. You can easily find documentation for various programming languages online, but it’s all scattered, and it’s not fast. Dochub solves this. Also, you can get the local version of the website <a href="https://github.com/rgarcia/dochub" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://github.com/rgarcia/dochub', 'from the Github page']);" target="_blank">from the Github page</a>.

**Link:** <a href="http://dochub.io/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dochub.io/', 'Dochub']);" target="_blank">Dochub</a>

## 3. Mozilla Developer Network

Mozilla Developer Network(MDN) provides a great in-depth documentation for CSS and Javascript. It’s more like Wikipedia for web developers (you can even edit the wiki, and changes will be reviewed). Bonus is that, you can also learn about making Firefox addons and HTML5 apps, which are cross platform.

**Link:** <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/', 'Mozilla Developer Network']);" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>

## 4. 30 days to learn HTML and CSS

If learning coding by reading documentation or books doesn’t work for you, then consider taking this free course. It’s a series of video tutorials by Jeffery Way, of TutsPlus. Of course, the tutorials are really basic, so if you want something more advanced, you should consider paying for <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://teamtreehouse.com/', 'Treehouse']);" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>, a subscription based learning platform for web and and even iOS developers.

## 5. Read Blogs

Blogs related to web designing are in plenty. Starting with the <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/', 'TutsPlus network']);" target="_blank">TutsPlus network</a>, till <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.smashingmagazine.com/', 'Smashing Magazine']);" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>, there are so many blogs dedicated to this niche. Most of them will rank well on Google, if you search for anything related to web designing, that’s the best way to find good blogs.

I&#8217;m sure there are many more sites which fall under this category, and I&#8217;m no web designer. So, do you know any free resources for learning web designing? Write them in the comments.
