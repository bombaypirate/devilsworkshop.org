Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 8 operating system is available around the world for people to either buy or upgrade. Most new computers manufacturers over the next few months will start offering Windows 8 on their devices. Windows 8 is priced reasonably and it is affordable for many. This should ideally reduce the amount of piracy of Windows 8 OS.

At this moment we can either purchase Windows 8 pro or upgrade a recently bought computer to Windows 8 but with a discount. Both can be done online.

### Purchasing Windows 8 Pro in India

I decided to check how to go about upgrading my laptop to Windows 8 and how to go about doing that online. Windows 8 pro can be purchased online for **Rs. 1,999/-**.

Visit this link and download the file. The initial file is only 5 mb size and allow it to run after its downloaded. The file will check if your computer is compatible from hardware and software point of view. The purchase supports using a credit card or Paypal  I am not sure if PayPal would work for Indian buyers.

### Upgrading to recently bought Laptop to Windows 8 Pro

This applies only to people who have bought their laptops after the 2nd of June 2012. The upgrade on such laptops is available for **Rs. 699/-**.

Users need to register their laptops at this <a href="http://www.windowsupgradeoffer.com/en-IN" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.windowsupgradeoffer.com/en-IN', 'link']);" >link</a>. Microsoft will send across an email with your promo code and details on how to download and purchase Windows 8 Pro.

Hope this helps your upgrade to Windows 8 in India. At the moment I am unaware of any online retailer selling Windows 8 Pro in DVD.

Do drop in your experiences and views on Windows 8.
