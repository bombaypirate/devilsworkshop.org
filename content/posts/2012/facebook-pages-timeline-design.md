If you like regularly visiting a Facebook page or own one, you might be excited with this new update. Facebook pages are soon to undergo a new redesign. This new update will introduce &#8216;Timeline&#8217; feature into Facebook pages, just like they have done with profiles.

If you visit a page on which you are an admin, you will see the following message at the top of the page.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/facebook-pages-timeline-design/fb_pages_preview_message/" rel="attachment wp-att-55387"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-55387" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="FB_pages_preview_message" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/02/FB_pages_preview_message.png" alt="" width="600" height="103" /></a>

As the message explains, the new design will kick in from March 30, 2012. If you click on the &#8216;Preview&#8217; button, users can see how the new layout will look like.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/facebook-pages-timeline-design/fb_page_timeline/" rel="attachment wp-att-55390"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-55390" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="fb_page_timeline" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/02/fb_page_timeline.png" alt="" width="600" height="554" /></a>

Page Admins can either review the page or publish it to get the new layout right away. If you own Facebook Pages, it would be a good idea to look at the new layout before it becomes the default design.

Facebook has [recently introduced an IPO][1], which might give it a market valuation of $100 billion. With investors comes greater pressure to monetize and it seems the latest design upgrade for pages will push more interaction between brands and Facebook users.
