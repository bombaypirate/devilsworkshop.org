LinkedIn had a security breach yesterday which led to more than 6 million passwords being leaked.Â LinkedIn&#8217;s response to be honest was initially quite slow and guarded.

At such times usually it is better for a company to over-communicate rather than stay quite. Finally they have confirmed that about 6.5 million passwords were leaked from their website. These were hashed passwords, meaning they were encrypted. (Read more about it <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/07/taking-steps-to-protect-our-members/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/07/taking-steps-to-protect-our-members/', 'here']);" >here</a>)

There is an online tool called <a href="http://leakedin.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://leakedin.org/', 'LeakedIn']);" >LeakedIn</a> which allows users to find out if their passwords is among the 6.5 million leaked ones.
