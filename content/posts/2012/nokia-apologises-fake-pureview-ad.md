Nokia in an event yesterday, introduced the much awaited Windows 8 phones to the world. The Nokia Lumia 920 is being touted as a phone that would help Nokia become a relevant brand in the mobile phone business.

But controversy broke out when <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/5/3294545/nokias-pureview-ads-are-fraudulent" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/5/3294545/nokias-pureview-ads-are-fraudulent', 'The Verge']);" >The Verge</a>, first pointed out that the advertisement show casing PureView camera stabilization technology (OIS) was a fake.

In the advertisement, a reflection clearly shows that the camera being used to take the image was not a phone.

Nokia has <span style="color: #d54e21;">apologized</span><a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/09/06/an-apology-is-due/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/09/06/an-apology-is-due/', ' on its blog']);" > on its blog</a> for not having the correct disclaimers but its reputation has already been harmed. Last thing Nokia need was to showcase the camera and then come out and apologize for faking the video itself.

### Nokia Lumia 920 Features

  * The phone features 4.5-inched curved glass display.
  * 1.5 GHz dual-core S4 processor.
  * Lumia 920 is a Windows 8 phone.
  * The phone will have 8.7 megapixels camera.
  * 1 GB Internal Memory and 32 GB storage.

In the long run the problem with Lumia 920 is not the controversy of the fake video. It will be the platform it runs on and its ability to compete with the apps ecosystem of Android and iOS.

If Windows 8 does not kick in some magic, it might be too late for Nokia.
