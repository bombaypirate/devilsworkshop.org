Microsoft is expected to push through Windows 8 along with many manufacturers on PCs, Mobiles and Tablets. But with Surface, it might alienate some manufacturers.

Microsoft probably took the help of Nokia to create this tablet though it is unclear at the moment. What Microsoft has done with Surface tablets, is that they have created a standard for what Microsoft envisions of other manufacturers when they roll out their Windows 8 tablets.

What are your views on Microsoft launching its own tablet devices?
