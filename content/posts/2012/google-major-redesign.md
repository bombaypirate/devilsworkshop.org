Redesigns are always a tricky part for any social network. Last year when Google+ was released, Facebook reacted with Timeline and a complete redesign. Google+ is often called a better designed clone of Facebook and it is living up to that identity by rolling out cover photos for Google+ profiles.

The new design has also made Google+ features (which were probably under utilized) a lot more prominent by sticking the icons to the left hand side of the page.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/google-major-redesign/google_plus_new_design/" rel="attachment wp-att-56874"><img class="size-full wp-image-56874 alignnone" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Google_plus_new_design" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/Google_plus_new_design.png" alt="" width="550" height="290" /></a>

The new design is pretty decent and probably needed as Google+ was looking a little incoherent with it&#8217;s previous design. The fortunate part of this new design, is they have not touched the features or privacy options. This was one of my biggest grouse against Facebook, whenever they opt for major changes.

That said I wonder if Google+ did the wise thing by copying Facebook&#8217;s cover photos feature. The cover photos feature on Google+ is a sure sign of Facebook still setting the trend among social networks while others are still catching on.

Here is a video of the new Google+ design



I am not sure how many Google+ fans will get angry over the new design. When Facebook changed their design quite a few did not like Timeline at all, as is evident from [comments on this post][1].
