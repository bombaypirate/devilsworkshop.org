LG India has launched a newÂ campaign **&#8216;Smartphone Idea Camp&#8217;** which is an online contest for its costumers and techÂ enthusiastÂ people. In this two month long contest, consumers can suggest a unique application, feature, design or user interface ideas that they desire in their phones. The best ideas will get LG Optimus Smartphone and a prize value of **Rs. 15,00,000**. Also they will be shortlisted for the second round which&#8217;s a 3 day long workshop in New Delhi.

SHARE YOUR IDEA&#8221;. Please **noteÂ **thatÂ this contest is for Indian residents only. You can take part either individually or in a group (max. 4 people). LG will select top 40 best ideas based onÂ imagination, creativity and utility.

If you are from India then I think you should definitely give it a try. If your idea gets selected then you can win cool prizes plus you&#8217;ll soon see a Smartphone with your own suggested feature in it. ðŸ˜‰
