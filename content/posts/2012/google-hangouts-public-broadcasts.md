Google+ started out pretty much as a much better designed copy of Facebook. The user-interface and privacy options certainly earned it some approval but people in general did not flock to it in droves. That is because, you cannot dislodge a leader (read Facebook) by just creating a clone of it.

Google seems to be realizing this and has started leveraging its one truly different product called Hangouts.  
Yesterday, Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/google-hangouts-on-air-broadcast-your.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/google-hangouts-on-air-broadcast-your.html', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that users can publicly broadcast their Hangouts.

### How to start Public Broadcast of Hangouts!

  * Start a hangout with your Google+ friends. A new option to broadcast Hangouts will be available.
  * Select it and start with the Hangout. The whole Hangout will be available on your Google+ profile publicly. Google+ users will be able to watch it live.
  * What makes Hangouts more interesting is that the public Hangouts will also be streamed on your YouTube channel. It can also be embedded on a website or blog.

### Skype needs to watch out!

I remember writing a post on [5 companies that Google+ could put out of business][1]. One of them was Skype and that is because currently, it is used often to record online interviews. Hangouts could potentially replace Skype and its relevancy very quickly.
