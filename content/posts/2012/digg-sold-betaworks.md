### Did Social Networks or Spammers Kill Digg?

Overall Digg has some impressive numbers. It had 28 million story submissions along with 40 Million comments.

The company in 2006 was valued at $60 million. So it being sold 6 years later for less that 0.5% of that valuation shows how fast the company declined in recent years.

In the past 60 years, Twitter and Facebook became household names as far as social sharing was concerned. Other companies like StumbleUpon and [Pinterest][2] also ate into Digg’s share or social sharing.

Importantly, Digg had increasingly become a hotspot for spammers. It was a system which could be fixed to get certain links more attention.

In the end a combination of strong competitors along with spammers on its own network has brought about the end of Digg.
