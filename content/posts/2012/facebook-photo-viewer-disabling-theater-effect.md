Most of the people don&#8217;t like the new features of Facebook like profile design, ticker, questions, timeline profiles, news feed e.t.c. Personally I think these features are okay and not that much annoying as it used to be. But the only feature that I still don&#8217;t like is the theater effects of Facebook&#8217;s photo viewer. The older method was better when the photos used to get opened in a new page rather than showing it on the same page. Moreover theater effect also decreases the quality of the picture. But there&#8217;s a simple way of disabling this on chrome, firefox or even you can disable it temporarily on any browser, let&#8217;s see how you can do it.

### For Google Chrome:

If you are using Facebook on Google Chrome then the simplest way to disable Theater effect is to install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ngacolkajcnkbmgfnfeocjpbeikgejll" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ngacolkajcnkbmgfnfeocjpbeikgejll', 'Revert FB Photo Viewer']);" title="Click here"  target="_blank">Revert FB Photo Viewer</a> extension. This will give you back your old photo viewer on Chrome.

### For Mozilla Firefox:

For firefox you can use <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/96773" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/96773', 'facebook Photo Theater Killer']);" >facebook Photo Theater Killer</a> userscript. Before installing this to your Firefox make sure you have Greasemonkey add-on installed. You can also use it on Chrome with Tampermonkey extension.

### Temporarily disabling theater effect (any browser):

**Method 1: **Open a photo on Facebook. To view it normally without Theater effect just hit F5 key or refresh the page. You will see pics in classic Facebook photo viewer.

**Method 2: **Open a photo and check its link in the address bar. For example:

https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2944361161780&set=a.1207721306869.2032105.1043785484&type=3&theater

Now remove the *&type=3&theater *part from the end and hit enter. It will temporarily disable the theater effect for that album.

I hope this will make Facebooking better for you! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
