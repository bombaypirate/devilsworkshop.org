I love using VLC media player. It is the best way to watch a movie on my laptop. My favorite reasons for using VLC player are the add-ons which enable me to [find and download subtitles from the player][1] itself or another add-on that gets me [related information from Wikipedia][2] about the movie I am viewing.

As I use a Android phone, I am quite kicked about seeing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc.betav7neon" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc.betav7neon', 'VLC Beta on Google Play']);" >VLC Beta on Google Play</a>.

### VLC on Android: Features

  * Users can avail of a media library and supports browsing through folders.
  * The media player has the usual features like support for auto-rotation, aspect-ratio adjustments and volume adjustments on touch surface.

VLC Beta for Android is requires Android 2.1 or higher but the added requirement is that this beta version works only devices with CPU ARMv7. Versions for different devices will be released soon.

If you are a fan of VLC on Desktop and want it on your Android phone or tablet, give it a try and drop in your comments and views.
