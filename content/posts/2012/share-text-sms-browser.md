Sometimes when I am searching for a particular address online, I like saving it as a text message on my mobile phone. This is quite useful to refer back to it, while searching for that particular place in a cab or foot.

<a href="http://ontextme.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ontextme.com', 'Textme']);" >Textme</a> is one such web service which allows users to send selected text or even links via SMS from the browser itself.

### Features of onTextme

  * Textme is a simple web service which allows users to share text, images and links from the browser to an mobile phone in India.
  * This is done by installing a browser add-on. I tested it with Chrome but add-ons are available with Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox and Safari.
  * The service is free and without ads, which is a big plus as the last thing you want are more text ads on your phone.
  * Developers and site owners can also insert Textme buttons on their websites to make sharing content via SMS a lot more easier.
