Imagine you are a store that sells mobile phones or laptops. Usually I have used [MySmartPrice&#8217;s website to compare prices][1] offered by online retailers. It sometimes can help you get a discount from a physical store. More importantly you know if you are not getting ripped off. **MySmartPrice** has rolled out a Android app which also allows priceÂ comparison.The listed items are several and the prices are mined from several Indian e-commerce websites.

  * I found the app very simple. The focus mainly geared towards mobile phones, electronics goods and computers.
  * Browse through the categories and look up the name of the company under which various items are sub-categorized. It shows the list of those items available with their prices.
  * Tap on one of them and we get the cheapest price of that particular selection. We can swipe and look up specifications and also a complete list of prices from various online retail portals in India.
  * I was a little disappointed to not find a &#8220;books&#8221; category to look up the prices. I guess for books available on Indian sites, you might like to [check out Low Price app][3].
