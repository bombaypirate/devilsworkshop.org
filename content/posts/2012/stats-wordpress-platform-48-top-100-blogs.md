This blog runs on self-hosted WordPress platform, hence I have always been interesting in keeping tabs on the popularity of WordPress. Blogging as an activity is also at a all-time high and WordPress seems to dominate the top 100 blogs. According to <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/04/11/wordpress-completely-dominates-top-100-blogs/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/04/11/wordpress-completely-dominates-top-100-blogs/', 'Pingdom']);" >Pingdom</a>, out of the top 100 blogs in the world, 48 have adopted WordPress.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/stats-wordpress-platform-48-top-100-blogs/wordpress_top_100_blogs/" rel="attachment wp-att-56935"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56935" title="WordPress_top_100_blogs" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/WordPress_top_100_blogs.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="433" /></a>

Interestingly 39% of these top blogs are using self-hosted WordPress while 9% are using WordPress hosted service. That means more blogs use WordPress hosted than any other popular platform.

Movable Type which was quite popular once as a blogging platform is losing steam fast. This might because the top 100 blogs might have changed and chances are newer blogs are more prone to use WordPress.

Tumblr over the past year has really grown a lot. I wrote about [how it has a lot more pageviews than WordPress.com or Blogspot.com blogs][1]. While WordPress.com actually dominates with more visitors than other blogging platforms, clearly showing it seems to be better from a search engine optimization perspective.

This blog too started on <a href="http://bloggertowp.org/migrate-from-blogger-to-wordpress-best-tutorial/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloggertowp.org/migrate-from-blogger-to-wordpress-best-tutorial/', 'Blogger and later migrated to self-hosted WordPress']);" >Blogger and later migrated to self-hosted WordPress</a>. If you are blogging which platform are you using? Do drop in your comments.
