If you are feeling your Mac is running &#8220;slow&#8221; AND if you have Microsoft Office installed, then you can try removing Microsoft Office. I removed it (Microsoft Office) and my Mac got all its speed back. To confirm this, my other friends also noticed considerable speed improvement for Mac, when they removed Microsoft office.

## Microsoft Office 2008

For Microsoft Office 2008, Microsoft provides a small tool called &#8220;Remove Office&#8221; under `/Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Additional Tools`. At first, it may look like it does remove office completely as its name suggest but that is not true. You need to follow <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500821" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500821', 'official 2008 uninstallation instructions posted by Microsoft here']);" title="Remove Microsoft Office 2008 from Mac">official 2008 uninstallation instructions posted by Microsoft here</a>.

## Microsoft Office 2011

For Office 2011, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t provide any &#8220;Remove Office&#8221; tools! You need to follow <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768', 'official 2011 uninstallation instructions posted by Microsoft here']);" title="Remove Microsoft Office 2011 from Mac">official 2011 uninstallation instructions posted by Microsoft here</a>. I know instructions are quite lengthy and cumbersome for average users but that only official way.

### (Unofficial) Uninstaller for Microsoft office 2011

Unofficially, you can use a third party tool I found here &#8211; <a href="http://www.fixkb.com/downloads?did=9" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fixkb.com/downloads?did=9', 'http://www.fixkb.com/downloads?did=9']);" >http://www.fixkb.com/downloads?did=9</a> I found it after my job was done so I could not test it. But it seem to work as you can see from <a href="http://www.fixkb.com/2011/06/completely-uninstall-microsoft-office.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fixkb.com/2011/06/completely-uninstall-microsoft-office.html', 'comments on this post']);" >comments on this post</a>.

### Alternatives to Microsoft Office&#8230;

For Mac, there are many alternatives. I found all of them very disappointing to be honest.

Its not speed-issue only about Microsoft Office.They have many more issues so no votes for Microsoft Office anyway!

For word files, I use Mac&#8217;s &#8220;Preview&#8221; application as default application to &#8220;open&#8221; documents. 99% of the time I need to &#8220;read&#8221; only word files I come across.

If I need to &#8220;write&#8221;, I prefer Google Docs. In cases where I need to &#8220;edit&#8221; existing word files, I either upload them on Google Docs or open with them on <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.libreoffice.org/', 'LibreOffice']);" >LibreOffice</a>. I use LibreOffice for opening Powerpoint as well as Excel files also.

Sometimes LibreOffice breaks formatting but this occasional breaking of formatting is better than using a slow Mac always! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
