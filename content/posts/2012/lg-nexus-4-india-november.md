Yesterday [Google made the Nexus 4 phone official in a blog post][1]. LG is manufacturing the Nexus 4 phone. It will be initially available on 13th November in U.S, U.K, Australia, France, Germany, Canada and Spain.

Asus has already confirmed the Nexus 7 being available in India possibly in the month of November. LG India officials have <a href="http://androidos.in/2012/10/nexus-4-coming-to-asia-including-india-beginning-end-of-november/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://androidos.in/2012/10/nexus-4-coming-to-asia-including-india-beginning-end-of-november/', 'reportedly']);" >reportedly</a> confirmed that the new phone Nexus 4 will also be made available in India by November end.

The phone is priced very competitively at $299 for its 8GB unlocked version. Even with duties and taxes, LG could price it in India for around Rs. 20,000 and it will be a very competitive price for such a powerful phone with the latest stock Android version on it.

### Why LG Nexus 4 in India is very likely?

Samsung last year had let down a lot of Android users who expected it to roll out Galaxy Nexus in India. Unfortunately [Samsung shelved any plans for a Nexus phone in India][3] (if there were any in the first place) possibly to not have it clash with its Galaxy S3 launch.

LG itself does not have a phone that sells as well as Galaxy S3 in India. So it makes sense for LG to roll out a very competitive and in-demand phone in India.
