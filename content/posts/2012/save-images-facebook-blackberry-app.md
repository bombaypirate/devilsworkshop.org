Facebook for BlackBerry; a technically not so good application with some <a title="Bugs in Facebook for BlackBerry v2.0" href="http://devilsworkshop.org/bugs-facebook-blackberry-v20/" target="_blank">bugs</a> and lots of missing features but still millions are using it as they are using BlackBerry devices and they don&#8217;t have any other option. Of course they can use mobile browser for accessing Facebook but Facebook for BlackBerry is a better option.

A very important feature which is missing in this application is that you can&#8217;t save an image from Facebook. Suppose that your friend uploaded your picture and you want to use it as your profile picture then you have to take a Screenshot of that pic and then upload it as profile pic. But here&#8217;s a good alternative of saving pictures from Facebook using Facebook for BlackBerry, let&#8217;s see how you can do this:

### How to save images from Facebook for BlackBerry:

  * Open Facebook for Blackberry application on your BlackBerry smartphone.
  * Now open any picture you want to save on your device.
  * Press BlackBerry/options key, from the menu select &#8216;Set As Home Screen Image&#8217;. Please **note **that this will change your Homescreen wallpaper, don&#8217;t forget to change it again to the older one.

  * Finally open your device pictures to see that pic. It will be automatically saved there once you use it as your wallpaper.

Use this method to save images and you don&#8217;t have to use any applications for taking screenshots and use pictures with watermarks on them.
