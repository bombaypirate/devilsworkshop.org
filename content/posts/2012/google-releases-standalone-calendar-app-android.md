Google has made its official Calendar app available for all Android users. The App itself was only available for Google’s Nexus phone and Nexus 7 tablet users. Today, it has been made available for all devices using Android 4.0.3 onwards.

I decided to try out the Calendar app on my HTC phone running Android 4.0.3. I was not particularly happy with the Calendar widgets and apps that came with my phone.

### Google’s Standalone Calendar App Features

  * The calendar app allows users to edit and create events. Users can also respond to invitations sent to your via Google Calendars.
  * If you have multiple calendars that you are subscribed to, you can choose the calendar and the events that need to be displayed.
  * The app allows users to set a home time zone. This will be helpful for frequent travellers who hop from one time zone to another.
  * Users can snooze events from the Android notifications directly (my personal favourite).

The app, as I mentioned was available only on Nexus phones and tablets before today. It seems with this, Google is trying to give Android users more access to stock Android apps. Maybe more such announcements will come through on [29th October when Google planned a Android event][2].

If you are using an Android phone with ICS, try the Calendar app and drop in your views and opinions.
