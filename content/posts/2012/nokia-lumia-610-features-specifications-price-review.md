###  Price and Verdict:

The price of Nokia Lumia 610 in India is around **Rs.13,000**. The phone is overall good but there are so many competitors in the market for this price range. Applications for Windows phone are limited but most of them are good. The screen resolution is good but the video capturing quality could have been better. Well it&#8217;s a nice phone and if you love Nokia or Windows phone then you should definitely buy this else you can check out other options available in the market.
