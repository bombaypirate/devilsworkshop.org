<span style="color: #000000;">Angry Birds is one of the most popular games in recent times. The game has literally millions of people completely addicted to it. Facebook has been the only platform where you could not play Angry Birds, which was bit strange considering how games have really helped Facebook grow in the past couple of years.</span>

The game was supposed to be released on Valentines Day, but it seems they have released it a bit early.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Angry Birds initially started off with as a iPhone phenomenon and it still has premium versions for the iOS platforms. It is now available on Android and other mobile platforms too.</span>

Lately, [Angry Birds has been available on Chrome][2] as an app. Even when [Google+ introduced games][3], it had Angry Birds as a part of it.

### Why Facebook needs Angry Birds?

In the recent [IPO filed by Facebook][4], it has claimed that Zynga the company behind social games like Farmville is responsible for about 13% of its revenues. That means social gaming is actually earning the big money for Facebook and having one of the world most famous game on it would not hurt it.

Thanks to [Vibin Reddy][5] for the tip.
