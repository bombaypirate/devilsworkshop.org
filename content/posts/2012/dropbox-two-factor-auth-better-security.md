After recent reports of Dropbox users getting spammed and usernames/passwords getting stolen, they have finally introduced a couple of security features which includes the much needed Two-factor authentication.

[<img role="img" class="wp-image-61275" title="twofactorauth" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/08/twofactorauth-600x336.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="336" />][1]

To enable it, go to security tab in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/account#security" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.dropbox.com/account#security', 'your account page']);" >your account page</a> and look up for &#8216;Two-step verification&#8217; (shown in the screenshot). Hit the &#8216;change&#8217; link, and you&#8217;ll be guided through the process.

With Two-factor authentication on, you will be asked to enter a six-digit code (apart from password) every time you login through a new device. You can receive the code either through SMS or the Dropbox app.

You&#8217;ll also be given a 16-digit backup code which you need to write down. You can use that code for logging in if you don&#8217;t have access to your mobile.

Apart from Two-factor authentication, the security page also gives you information about previous logins &#8211; location, time and browser used to access the site. Also, your verified devices (for which you don&#8217;t need to enter any extra code) appear there.

It&#8217;s a bit of work, but definitely worth it if you store confidential information in the cloud.The feature will probably added to the stable build of Dropbox soon.
