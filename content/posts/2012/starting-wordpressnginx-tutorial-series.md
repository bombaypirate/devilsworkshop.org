When I started with Nginx, there was very less help available. I spent most of my time on Nginx IRC channel, mailing lists and forums.

What looked like a crazy move then, seems totally worth now. We handle almost half-million hits daily for more than 20 sites hosted on our dedicated server without any slowdown or downtime. I feel proud to switch to Nginx much earlier. As an early mover, I leaned way too many things myself as there was no alternative then.

Today, as a server-administrator, I feel that I have learned enough to authoritatively write down my own findings here as a series of articles. I hope you will find this helpful.

You can find more details about this series, its content and other details [here][2].

I will be publishing one article everyday on <a href="http://rtcamp.com/blog" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/blog', 'rtCamp&#8217;s blog']);" >rtCamp&#8217;s blog</a>.

At any time, you can <a href="http://rtcamp.com/support" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/support', 'use our free support forum if you need some technical help']);" >use our free support forum if you need some technical help</a>. Comments will be kept open to discuss article itself.

I hope you will find this series useful. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
