Usually I avoid using the default start page (New Tab page) on my Chrome browser. I prefer using a customized one which allows a bit more productivity.

As I love keeping in touch with news and updates from around the world, I found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhapeiiedfleakkilafdkgdnmnpkgkna" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhapeiiedfleakkilafdkgdnmnpkgkna', 'New Tab Feeder']);" >New Tab Feeder</a> a great way to get **News feeds** from reputed websites on the start page itself

## New Tab Feeder: Options

  * As the above screenshot<span style="color: #000000;"> shows</span>, users can constantly look up headlines from different sources.
  * Most importantly users can search within the headlines from the search bar.
  * The design is simple and background images can be sourced from Instagram.

I found this extension very useful if you are interested in the news. In case you want something more productive with the ability to leave yourself notes on the startpage, you might like looking up [Incredible Start Page][2].

You might also like<span style="color: #000000;"> to read</span>up these [5 great apps to customize your Chrome’s start page][3].
