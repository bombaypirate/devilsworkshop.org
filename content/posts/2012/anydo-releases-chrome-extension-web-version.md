The app pretty much resembles the Android version, with which you can organize your tasks into folders, set the priority for individual tasks, or even set reminders for email notifications. You can also add notes for the tasks, and the drag-and-drop functionality is handy to rearrange the tasks.

  I really like the typography – font type and the font color used, and the transitions are pretty smooth. I’m amazed, it doesn’t have voice recognition (which exists in the native Android app) which is actually built into Chrome.

  The extension is still in beta, and the team is gradually sending invites. All you got to do is, mail them at feedback(at)any.do, and they’ll be adding you to a Google group where you can get the link to download the extension.
