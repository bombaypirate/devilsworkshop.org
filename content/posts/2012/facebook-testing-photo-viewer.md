Google+ might have borrowed just about every idea from Facebook but it does have a few original ones too. The photo viewer on Google+ displays comments on the side. This allows a lot more comments to be viewed.

According to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/02/facebook-photo-viewer/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/02/facebook-photo-viewer/', 'TechCrunch']);" >TechCrunch</a>, Facebook is testing out something that pretty much copies the way Google+ displays its photos.

The current photo-viewer on Facebook is not exactly something I was happy with. That is why I like using this [Chrome extension that removes theatre effects from Facebook’s photo viewer][2].

### Is it okay for Google+ and Facebook to copy each other?

Though every time someone copies a feature from its competitor fans and expert lament or criticism. For instance Google introduced +1 buttons which were clearly inspired from the ‘Like’ buttons. I feel it is sometimes good to copy a really useful and good feature rather than to try to reinvent the wheel.

By copying, I do not mean copying codes or copyrighted content. If Google+ copied elements from Facebook, then Facebook did the same from MySpace. But I do wonder how users will feel if Facebook and Google+ both end up beings clones rather than competitors.

What are your views on Facebook’s new photo viewer being tested? Do drop in your comments.
