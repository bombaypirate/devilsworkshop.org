Samsung has launched a new tablet, called Galaxy Note 10.1 (not to be confused with [Galaxy Note 2][1] phone which will be launched later this month). The tablet is released in Germany and UAE at the moment and expected to be made available in other countries soon.

The tablet market has a few newsmakers this year, which include [Google’s Nexus 7][3] and Apple’s [New iPad (or iPad 3)][4]. With Galaxy Note 10.1, Samsung is probably pitting it against Apple’s New iPad.

### Will Stylus work with Galaxy Note 10.1?

Before the iPad, most people were obsessed about using the Stylus. The idea was to sell tablets to executives to take down notes. Fact was the stylus has never really been a great product to take down notes in digital formats.

This image of the Galaxy Note 10.1 seems to suggest the device can read what your write down (which would be great for students). It also would be a much easier way to write down short notes or reminders.

But look closely and the letters on the tablet are not in the natural cursive style of writing. I have not used the Note 10.1 so will not be able to comment on its ability to leverage the stylus.

Unless a tablet with a stylus which really manages to replicate the feel of writing with a pen, it would still not be much of a game changer. Even smartphones with touch screens replicate with small vibrations, the feeling of pressing a button on the screen.
