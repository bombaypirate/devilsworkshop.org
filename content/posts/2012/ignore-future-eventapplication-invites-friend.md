Facebook is an interesting social-networking website but what makes it annoying is the useless notifications you get everyday about games and applications and some event requests. Earlier we told you a way of <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/remove-block-unwanted-applications-facebook/" target="_blank">blocking a particular application</a> so that you won&#8217;t get any request related to that application from any of your friends. But what if you still want to receive requests but not from a particular friend, well here&#8217;s the solution for you.

### Blocking requests from a particular friend for an application:

For this go to your Apps and Games page from the sidebar of your Facebook homepage. Alternatively you can click the link below.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/games" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/games', 'https://www.facebook.com/games']);" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/games</a>

After that reject any request from a friend by clicking &#8216;Cross&#8217; sign given with the accept button. Now to reject all the future requests from that friend click on &#8220;*Ignore all requests from \*friends name\*?*&#8221; on the same page as shown below.

### Blocking requests from a particular friend for an event:

If you are getting so many event invitations than it&#8217;s a good idea to block those invites rather than removing that person from your friends list. To ignore all event invites go to your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/events/', 'events page']);" target="_blank">events page</a>. Now first of all decline an event request and then click on the button given with the text &#8216;You Declined&#8217;. See the pic below.

After that click confirm to stop receiving future invites from that particular friend.Â That&#8217;s it, now you will stop getting useless invites and notifications.
