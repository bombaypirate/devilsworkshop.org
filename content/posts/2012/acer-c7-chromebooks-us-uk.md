Today Google has unveiled a new Chromebook. This one is from Acer and is priced at a competitive $199. It is available in the US and UK markets via Google Play or Best Buy.

Last month, Google also had [another Chromebook variant from Samsung][2]. The price tag of that device was $249. I think Chromebooks are great if you are comfortable using Chrome OS. To be honest, I am still not very convinced about the a new type of laptop making a big dent in the computer market.

I also have realized that a lot of new updates on Google seems to be hardware related instead of web related. This post too falls in that category. Do you think Google should just stick web and Android instead of launching new phone, tablets and laptops? Do drop in your comments.
