In my view Facebook and to some extent Twitter are real successes in the social media story. Google+ might be growing but it has a long way to go yet. LinkedIn is nice, but it’s focus is on professional profiles. So when a new social product come up for discussion, I get a little apprehensive.

I felt the same way about ***Pinterest***, before testing it out. I mean what it essentially did, was allowing users to share URLs with friends on Twitter and Facebook in an organized way. Social bookmarking is not exactly something new.

That said, <a href="http://pinterest.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pinterest.com', 'Pinterest']);" >Pinterest</a> is very addictive and has a simple way of sharing things you are interested in.

### Pinterest Features

  * Pinterest as the name suggests, is like an online pinboard of things you are interested in. You need to Pin (bookmark) a page your found interesting and add a description.
  * One can also assign categories or pinboards. This allows people to share things in a relevant way, such as book reviews can be shared in a board named “Books I like Reading”.
  * Pinterest seems to be visually rich, in the sense it tries to capture your attention with images from the link you have shared rather than its title. This is a departure from bookmarking sites like say Delicious or Google Bookmarks.

  * Users can hook up their Twitter and Facebook account to Pinterest, and share what they pinned. Make sure you do not

### A Potential Goldmine for Brands

First thing that strike you about Pinterest are the number of brands being endorsed by people. Pinterest does not really concentrate on building a network but more like a showcase of your interests. Most people share these things publicly, as it is about endorsing a product, brand, book or even a type of service.

At the moment, Pinterest is only by invitation and still is attracting a lot of interest. But the next few months will tell us, if it a social product that will continue to grow and become more interactive.
