I have not used Google Earth for a long time since I go a new laptop for myself. But when I found out that Google has released a new version Google Earth 6.2, I was curious to check it out. Google Earth is a product that people probably use lesser now a days, as it is more practical to use Google maps.

But true map lovers will probably will enjoy Google Earth a lot more. I think will soon replace most traditional world atlas books anyways.

### Google Earth 6.2 Features

  * The new version of Google Earth makes a big improvement from a visual point of view. Earlier we saw while the map was being rendered, a jigsaw of rectangular blocks show up. Now it is a lot more seamless and smoother.
  * Also there are many search improvements, along with auto-complete for Google Earth search. This will a big help for users and might attract more search queries using Google Earth.
  * Finally, the social push for Google Earth comes with the option of sharing screenshots from the software directly onto Google+. Users can also share screen shots via email.
