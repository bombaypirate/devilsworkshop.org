Increasingly the fight for who controls smart-phones the world over, has become iOS (Apple) vs. Android (Google). This is because more than specifications of a phone, apps have become more important. Apps make mobiles phones more personal and people tend to not migrate from one platform to another if they are hooked on to apps and features of a particular platform.

This <a href="http://blog.utest.com/infographic-the-state-of-mobile-app-quality-android-vs-ios/2012/02/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.utest.com/infographic-the-state-of-mobile-app-quality-android-vs-ios/2012/02/', 'infographic']);" >infographic</a> by UTest, shows a great comparison between apps form these two competitors. Remember iOS as a platform only runs on iPhones and is not open-sourced. Android is a lot more open and manufacturers can actually do a lot more with it (good and bad things).

It seems overall Appleâ€™s iOS has better performance of Apps, but that is expected as iOS runs on a predictable sort of hardware. While Android apps seems to be easy on the wallet.

Do you own an iPhone or Android phone? Which one would you prefer? Do drop in your comments.
