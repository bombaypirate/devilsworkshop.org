I&#8217;ve been a long time user of Google Reader, and though RSS might sound old school to a lot of people, it works for me. Unlike Windows, which has very few good RSS readers (and most of them are ugly, seriously), Mac has got a lot of news readers to choose from.

Reeder is essentially a RSS reader for your Mac which actually sync with your Google Reader (so all your subscribed blogs, starred items, etc. are still there).

Reeder is really beautiful in design, with a very Mac-ish look, i.e having a gray feeling all over it which makes user focus on the content.

It has a three column layout allowing you to switch between two themes. You can also customize the tint, texture, contrast etc., which will make the app more reading-friendly.

One really good thing about Reeder is that, it supports a lot of sharing services including Pocket, Readability, Evernote, App.net and a lot more. If you&#8217;re running Mountain Lion, Reeder will use system wide Facebook, Twitter and iMessage sharing feature.

The app supports multi touch gestures and a bunch of keyboard shortcuts which are configurable, too.

Reeder isn&#8217;t filled with lot of features, but that&#8217;s what makes it so usable. The app isn&#8217;t free, you can get it for 4.99$ on the Mac Appstore. It is also available for iPad and iPhone.
