As I decided to jot down things that I might expect to happen in the technology world in 2013, I ended up writing mostly thinking about Apple, Samsung, Google and Facebook. But what about very popular companies that are struggling? I thought it would be interesting to write down about five tech related companies for whom 2013 could potentially be a ***&#8220;make or break&#8221;*** year.

### #1. Research in Motion (BlackBerry)

[<img class=" wp-image-70040 alignright" alt="RIM BlackBerry" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/12/RIM-BlackBerry.jpg" width="270" height="182" />][1]The Canadian company has been struggling not just from competition by Apple&#8217;s iPhone but also Android based phones. Once a BlackBerry phone symbolized the words &#8220;smart phone&#8221;. It is still a very popular phone with office going executives but it has lost out in being relevant to younger buyers. RIM also has seen its tablet offering called Playbook finding very few takers.

RIM will launch BlackBerry 10 featuring the new BB10 OS on 30th January. The year ahead with new BlackBerry phones could possibly mark its big turn around or its fall into the abyss. Forget an about turn, I am not sure it will even manage to keep a status quo in the mobile market. It will face additional competition from new Windows 8 phones that will enter the market in bigger numbers in 2013.

### #2. Nokia

[<img class=" wp-image-70041 alignright" alt="Nokia WIndows Phones" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/12/Nokia-WIndows-Phones.jpg" width="279" height="180" />][2]Nokia has a glorious past as cell-phone manufacturer just like RIM. The company actually failed to get enough app developers on its platform and saw itself underestimating the acceptability of touch-screen phones. While Samsung bet on Android to produce smart-phones, [Nokia shook hands with Microsoft][3].

In the year ahead, Nokia has a well received Lumia 920 running Windows 8. The next iteration of Lumia 920 will be crucial. The real problem for Nokia is that at the moment its destiny is not its own hands. It is in the hands of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 8 phone becoming popular. Nokia will not just be working hard in 2013 but also praying hard for success of Windows 8 phone.

### #3. Facebook

[<img class=" wp-image-69251 alignright" alt="Facebook App Android" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/12/Facebook-App-Android.png" width="252" height="163" />][4]Facebook had a mixed year in 2012. It [launched its IPO][5], [bought Instagram][6] and showed off a [newly designed mobile app for iPhones][7] and [Android][8]. But these were not exactly signs of great innovation by Facebook. These updates and acquisitions were mainly an exercise of catching up.

Facebook has not really been pushed too much by Google+ in 2012 but expect that to change in the year ahead. Facebook is still struggling to find a way to make money from mobile phone platforms. More people will end up using Facebook as an app from their phones or tablets than their browsers. This would mean the current revenue stream of getting clicks from ads will see a decline. Facebook Gifts is a novel idea which would make Facebook&#8217;s revenue model as e-commerce instead of advertising. It also has not exactly fixed its reputation on the privacy front.

If Facebook continues to struggle to make money from it&#8217;s mobile phone platform 2013, it would with some big questions marks on Facebook&#8217;s future. That said its [1 billion users][9] will make sure it remains relevant despite the health of its revenues.

### #4. Dropbox

[<img class=" wp-image-56725 alignright" alt="Dropbox_logo" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/Dropbox_logo.png" width="180" height="180" />][10]Personally I love using Dropbox. I have used it for over two years. I love its referral program and also use it as a default service to [backup my photos][11].

But the threat to Dropbox is very real. It faces competition from some seriously big players with some seriously deep pockets. [Google Drive][12] and [Apple&#8217;s iCloud][13] services will challenge Dropbox.

The problem for Dropbox seems two-fold. It lacks the financial resources of Apple and Google. Additionally it also lacks having its own mobile phone platform like an iOS and Android or online services like Gmail or Google search. If Dropbox does not hold its own against Google and Apple, it might have to think of a dreaded word called &#8220;acquisition&#8221;.

### #5. Microsoft

[<img class=" wp-image-67114 alignright" alt="Windows8_package" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/10/Windows8_package.png" width="200" height="219" />][14]I thought more than a few times before putting Microsoft in this list. But it makes sense that 2013 will be the year, Microsoft will make a incredible turn-around or end up further behind the likes of Google and Apple. Microsoft has faltered with its online business with Bing. It has also invested in So.cl which is a social network that not one has taken notice of as yet.

Windows 8 as an OS is great attempt by Microsoft. It is a real step forward design wise by Microsoft. The company&#8217;s big problem is that Windows 8 phone is not exactly getting people very excited. The Surface tablets also have not exactly caught people&#8217;s imagination and Microsoft has nothing in the 7-inch tablet form factor.

One major issue for Microsoft has been developing a great app eco-system for developers. At the moment is a [bit of a ghost town][15]. It is nowhere close to the likes of Apple&#8217;s app store or Google Play. If Microsoft does not fix these drawbacks with Windows 8 over the year, 2013 could end up being the year which would mark the beginning of the end in Microsoft&#8217;s history.

What are your expectations from the tech world for the year ahead? Do let us know in your comments. Also as this is the last post before the year 2012 ends, let me take this opportunity to wish all our readers a very **&#8220;Happy New Year!&#8221;**
