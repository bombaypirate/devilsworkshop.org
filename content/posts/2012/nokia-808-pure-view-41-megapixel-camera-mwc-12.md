The Mobile World Congress 2012 (MWC 12), is underway in Barcelona, Spain. Nokia has made a big splash at the MWC 12, giving a sneek-peek at their latest mobile phone called Pure View. The incredible part of this phone it is will be packing a 41 Megapixel sensor. Yup, that was not a typo, it will have a 41 Megapixel sensor.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/nokia-808-pure-view-41-megapixel-camera-mwc-12/nokia_808_pureview/" rel="attachment wp-att-55291"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-55291" title="nokia_808_pureview" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/02/nokia_808_pureview.png" alt="" width="506" height="422" /></a>

The 41 megapixel camera will allow to shoot and record in very high resolutions. Some great innovations promised is allowing upto 4X zoom, with no loss of quality of the image. If reasonably priced, I can see these phones pretty much replacing most point and shoot cameras out there.

Most people will concentrate on the 41 megapixel camera but there will be somethings worth noting. The phone does not seem to have a front-facing camera. This obviously means no video calling support on the phone.

Other details like memory storage and battery have not been disclosed as yet. These might be interesting details too as photos of such high resolution will probably need decent sized memory storage.

### Revival for Symbian OS?

The phone will run on Symbian Belle and could probably be the most exciting device brought out by Nokia in the past couple of years. It might be the last gasp attempt at revival of Symbian by Nokia.

In recent past, it seems to be doing a lot better with its Lumia series running Windows 7.5 OS for Mobile phones. So this phone can Â be viewed as sort of a reiteration of Nokia&#8217;s support of Symbian OS.



What are your views on a 41 Megapixel sensor for a camera? Will you buy this phone? Do drop in your comments.
