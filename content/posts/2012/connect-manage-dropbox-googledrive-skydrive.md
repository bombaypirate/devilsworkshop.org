There are many cloud storage options online like Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive and more. I use [Dropbox to backup my photos from my mobile and digital camera][1], while I use [Google Drive][2] to manage important documents and files.

Otixo is a great web app, that allows users to link up their cloud storage accounts from Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive.

## Otixo Features

  * Add you accounts from multiple services once you register.
  * The default free account allows your a monthly bandwidth of 2 GB.
  * Users can upload, download, preview, rename folders, create new folders all from the Otixo interface.
  * We can share documents with a single link, which can expire after 30 days. We can reduce the number of days the link stays active too.

I found ***Otixo*** quite useful but would love to see a mobile app for it rather than use from the browser.

Try out Otixo and let me know in your comments if you know of similar services to link up cloud storage on multiple accounts.
