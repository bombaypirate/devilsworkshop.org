Recently, Vibin Reddy wrote a nice post which reviewed a [list of 5 websites to learn HTML/CSS][1]. It is a great resource for beginners, especially if you are new to web designing. In the list was ***Codecademy***, which is allows learners to complete exercises created by experts.

Codecademy has now rolled out resources to learn Python programming language for beginners.

### Codecademy’s Focus on Python

Python is popularly known for being a expressive language. The syntax is simple.  It is often used for scripting web servers or even network servers.

Codecademy has courses on JQuery, JavaScript, HTML/CSS. In a way this is a first foray into server side languages.

This seems like a good way to start your foray into learning Python.

In the future Codecademy is probably introducing the courses for Ruby language.

In case you are new to programming languages like PHP, you might want to check [this tutorial series][3].

Also if you know more great resources for learning programming and Python in particular, do let me know through your comments.
