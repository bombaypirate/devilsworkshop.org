Facebook has seen decent success with promoted posts or Ads. It was a great way for Facebook Page owners to get their brands better visibility and to reach a bigger audience.

Facebook now allows you to promote personal posts.

### Quick Tips on Promoting personal posts

  * When you update your Facebook account with a post, an option to promote it shows up.
  * Just note that the promotion option is available only for 6 hours after the post was originally posted.
  * The payment options are Paypal, Credit Cards, Mobile phones, Western Union Quickpay.

  * A promoted post shows up as a “Sponsored Story” to friends. The way Facebook ensures it gets enough publicity is by bumping it up in your friend’s news feed.

### The Pricing Model for promoted posts

The price set for promoted posts seems to vary between regions. As this <a href="http://www.knowledgehub.co.in/2012/09/facebook-promoted-posts-for-users.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.knowledgehub.co.in/2012/09/facebook-promoted-posts-for-users.html', 'post in Knowledge Hub']);" >post in Knowledge Hub</a> suggests that the price might vary on the geographic location the user promoting the post is from.

That seems a markedly different approach from other advertising platforms which charge based on the geographic location and size of the targeted audience.

I am not sure how popular this service will be, as I think usually people do not like promoting their personal posts.
