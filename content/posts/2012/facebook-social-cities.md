The most powerful online tool for any social network, which wants to display ads is local data. Facebook allows users to check-in to different popular locations around the world, precisely to tap into such data. Usually it helps the local brand of a popular location in a city when people check-in while visiting it. It sort of ends up being a word of mouth promotion for a restaurant, hotel or even a large shopping centre.

Here is an infographic of the most social cities <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/Social-Landmarks-Around-the-World-17e.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://newsroom.fb.com/News/Social-Landmarks-Around-the-World-17e.aspx', 'released by Facebook']);" >released by Facebook</a> along with their most checked-in landmarks.

Look at the infographic above it shows that the most popular landmarks across the world where people check-in are sports stadiums.

I still think of this feature on Facebook as highly under utilized, especially compared to [something like Google+ local][2], where I can actually leave a review of a restaurant or store I visit.

What are your thoughts on Facebook check-in feature and do you use it? Do drop in your comments.
