For example, if I am in India and type in Google.com, I am automatically redirected to Google.co.in.

While this is a very useful feature, especially while carrying out a local search, it is desirable to shift to Google.com page and carry out the search.

### Restrict Google’s Redirection Page

You can also restrict Google from redirecting you to a country specific search or results page by appending the URL with **“/ncr”**.

So for example you can type in “***google.com/ncr***” in your browser and you will not be redirected to a local domain like say ***“Google.co.in***”.

Hence no matter wherever you are in the world, it will restrict Google from redirecting you to a country specific page.

NCR is a abbrevation of No Country Restriction. Thanks to <a href="https://plus.google.com/106236489182442617349/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/106236489182442617349/', 'Gokul']);" >Gokul</a> for the tip.
