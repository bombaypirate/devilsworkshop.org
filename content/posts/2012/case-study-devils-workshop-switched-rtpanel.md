<span style="color: #000000;">rtPanel </span>is a flagship product of <a href="http://rtcamp.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/', 'rtCamp']);" title="rtCamp">rtCamp</a> launched as open-source for WordPress enthusiast. rtPanel is a WordPress Theme Framework and forms a standard base for theme developers to create awesome themes. rtPanel team also offer free <a href="http://rtpanel.com/support/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtpanel.com/support/', 'technical support']);" title="Support">technical support</a> to developers.

### Why did we move?

rtPanel has been growing rapidly (already crossed 5000+ downloads mark). The optimized mark-up of rtPanel framework, improves the site speed and SEO capability. DevilsWorkshop being a part of rtCamp, we decided to use it as a case study to show rtPanel&#8217;s capability.  It was a perfect example to consider, as it has a huge reader base, vast content, multiple authors and different functional elements.

We also used this opportunity to rebrand the website with even better looks and refreshing design. Read [this ][1]to know more about re-design.

Devilsworkshop was earlier running over rtBase framework (internally used in rtCamp). It was later evolved over 2 years of experiential learning with more than 1000+ WordPress projects. The ultimate goal of bringing it to public, was later achieved with launch of rtPanel.

### A Good Friday:

On a fine morning of a Friday (February 5, 2012), we just decided to switch Devils&#8217; Workshop on rtPanel. The development was done on live site and within 3 working days it was implemented.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/case-study-devils-workshop-switched-rtpanel/dw-infographic_revised/" rel="attachment wp-att-56225"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56225" title="dw-infographic_revised" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/03/dw-infographic_revised.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="1062" /></a>

&nbsp;

The results are beyond our expectations and it concluded that rtPanel framework can truly do wonders. The increase in traffic was due the optimized markup and default integration of Yoast SEO plugin. The increased traffic ultimately lead to increase in Google Adsense revenue by whooping 85%.

*Bounce rate is increased, as during design phase, the navigation to archive posts was not given. Now its been corrected, and we hopefully will see the better bounce rate in next months stats.
