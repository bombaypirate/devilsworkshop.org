As far as Android based OEMs go, HTC is a few steps behind the very successful Samsung. HTC is known for churning out solid phone products but has still struggled with revenues and profits. HTC has now released a new Android based phone called Droid DNA which should be considered a competitor to Galaxy Note 2 by Samsung.

### The Good

The phones has pretty much everything one expects out of a smartphone. It will run on Android 4.1 (Jellybean). The phone itself has a display screen of 5 inches, with support for multi-touch. It has a decent 8 MP, 3264 X 2448 pixel camera.

The phone is supported on 2G, 3G and 4G and Wifi networks.

More importantly the phone is powered by 1.5GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM.

### The Bad

The internal memory on this phone is 16GB. That seems to be a little on the low side. The issue is compounded by no option for external storage as there is no microSD slot.

### The Ugly

I use a HTC V One phone. It is a lower end phone running Android 4.0 (ICS) on it, when compared to Droid DNA. But one major complaint I have against it is how OEMs straddle the Android OS with their own UI.

HTC Droid DNA is no exception and it is bundled with the Sense 4+ UI along with Android 4.1.1. There are many [who like the stock Android versions without OEM UIs on their phones][2]. But then again, only the Nexus brand of phones and tablets carry stock Android versions.

All said and done, the phone looks like a solid device with solid features and very few disappointments. HTC as a company is actually struggling financially and a good phone device being available only a few days before “Black Friday&#8221; sales in the US markets could be just about perfect timing.

Would you go with HTC Droid or wait for Galaxy S4 which is expected early 2013? Do drop in your comments.
