Samsung has <a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=20883" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=20883', 'released']);" >released</a> two new phones, Galaxy Grand and Galaxy Grand Duos. The Galaxy Grand has a 5-inch screen and looks a lot like it&#8217;s more famous cousin the [Galaxy S3][1]. The phone has been unveiled with no fanfare. It is expected to be priced significantly lower than high end phones like Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 2. The price range would potentially make it a very lucrative buy in markets like India, south-east Asia and Africa.

### Galaxy Grand Features

  * The phone has a 5-inch WVGA TFT Touchscreen. The disappointing part is the low resolution of 800 X 480 pixels.
  * It does have 1GB RAM and processor speed being 1.2 GHz. That is not exactly the 1.5 GHZ that most newer models over the year will sport. Internal storage is 8 GB.
  * It will feature the latest version of Android 4.1.2 and also have 8 MP back facing camera. The front camera is 2MP.
  * The phone supports 2G, 3G and Wi-fi networks. It is not compatible with 4G networks.

The Galaxy Grand Duos has all the same specs with added functionality of using dual-SIMs.

Samsung might be getting a bad reputation for being a copy-cat but it has shown the ability to surprise. When the Galaxy Note was out, many experts (including yours truly) thought it was too big to be a phone. But Galaxy Note and [Note 2][2] have sold in their millions proving that Samsung does have a keen sense of what the market might be looking for.

With Galaxy Grand it is obviously targeting buyers in markets like India and other countries where users might be interested in a low cost hybrid of Galaxy S3 and Note 2. This is potentially a smart move by Samsung as it might undercut competitors like LG to capture the mid-level priced smartphone niche. The phone might also be a hit with frequent travelers who would find the dual-SIM option useful.
