Last year, a security update from [Microsoft tagged Chrome as ‘Malware’][1]. It did cause trouble for some Chrome users, who had to re-install their browser and that probably set some people wondering if Microsoft was upto some mischief. Microsoft has done it again now, by tagging Google.com as a Malware in a February 2012 update.

After a Microsoft Security update, many people, when they visited Google.com, ended up getting the following <a href="http://searchengineland.com/microsoft-security-patch-marked-google-com-as-malware-111922" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://searchengineland.com/microsoft-security-patch-marked-google-com-as-malware-111922', 'message']);" >message</a>.

Many complained about not being able to look up Google.com on this <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/Forefrontedgegeneral/thread/e8eb8300-ecdd-4b23-b6df-f6ac0a67a226" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/Forefrontedgegeneral/thread/e8eb8300-ecdd-4b23-b6df-f6ac0a67a226', 'Microsoft forum']);" >Microsoft forum</a>. Soon Microsoft released a patch that fixed the issue.

If you are facing a similar issue, you might want update Microsoft Security Essentials. This will fix the issue.

## How to detect unsafe websites?

If you want to make sure that a particular website is unsafe or not, then it is better to check it through multiple sources like [WOT][3] and [McAfee Site Advisor][4]. If more than one source finds a particular website unsafe, it is best to avoid it.

The reason, I suggest using more than one source is, because in the past even Google’s own safe browsing [diagnostic tool has suggested Google.com has potential ‘Malware’ on it][5].
