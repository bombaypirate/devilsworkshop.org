On my Facebook account, I have almost everyone I have known in my life. It also is a great place to keep in touch with family and friends who live far away. I often have some nice photos uploaded from my school days uploaded by some friend of my or the other.

Most friends of mine end up tagging me to these photos. I do like to download some of these photos so in case it is taken down, I can still have a copy with me.

I found this nice online tool which allows users to automatically backup photos they are tagged in to a designated folder on Dropbox.

I am using <a href="http://ifttt.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ifttt.com', 'Ifttt']);" >Ifttt</a>, a neat website that allows users to create triggers to carry out actions. In this case whenever someone tags me in a photo, it will set off a trigger. The result will be that the photo will be downloaded into a folder on my Dropbox account.

## Creating a Trigger with ifttt

  * First <a href="https://ifttt.com/join" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://ifttt.com/join', 'register with ifttt']);" >register with ifttt</a> and look up the various recipes.
  * It has many that allows backing up FB photos to Dropbox. My personal choice was <a href="http://ifttt.com/recipes/166" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ifttt.com/recipes/166', 'this recipe']);" >this recipe</a>.
  * Now connect your Facebook account and approve the website to access it.
  * Then do the same with your Dropbox account.

Now next time someone tagâ€™s your photo on Facebook, it will automatically trigger a download to your Dropbox. Considering Dropbox is a sync service, I am basically saving all my tagged photos in the cloud available to me anywhere on any computer without necessarily logging into Facebook.

Try out ***ifttt*** and its numerous options to create triggers between various online webapps. Do drop in your comments.
