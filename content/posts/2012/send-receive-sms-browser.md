I blog using a laptop in my home. That means I often move from one room to another with my laptop. Unfortunately in such cases, I always forget to carry my phone with me. It gets a little bothersome when I get an SMS and I have to move back to where I left my phone to check who sent me a message.

**Mighty Text** is a service which allows users to use their own phone number, to send and receive SMS messages from your Chrome browser. Users can also call from their browsers.

### MightyText Features

  * MightyText works only for phones running on Android. Download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.texty.sms" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.texty.sms', 'Mighty Text App']);" >Mighty Text App</a> from Google Play.
  * Now check out the extension or add-on for your browser. I really liked the fact that it supports Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 9 and Safari.
  * Now the phones numbers needs to be synced to the browser and we are set.
  * Whenever a SMS is sent to you number, you will receive a notification on your desktop.

I can also reply to the text messages from my browser. Not just that, I can also call a number from the browser window itself but to speak with the person, one has to get up and reach the phone. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The service at the moment is only available on Android. Try out **MightyText** if you have a Android phone and do drop in your comments.
