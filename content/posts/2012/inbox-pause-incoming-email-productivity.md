If you get a lot of Email daily, then you must also be spending a lot of time in reading and replying to them. The problem is, the constant stream of incoming Email make it hard to concentrate on doing that.

Inbox Pause is a nice little Chrome extension which solves this by adding a pause button in Gmail. Just hit the blue &#8216;Pause&#8217; button in Gmail&#8217;s side bar, authorize the app through your Google account and the service will become active.

In short, it&#8217;ll aggregate all your incoming Email and show it when you resume it. You get to see a yellow bar on the top when the service goes active, notifying you to click the &#8216;Unpause&#8217; button to stop the service.

You can also setup an automated message for incoming mail, but I think it hardly helps in any way, as people mostly end up sending a chat message if it&#8217;s urgent.

The extension is made by the same people who developed [Boomerang for Gmail][2], a very popular plugin for scheduling Emails.

How do you handle Email overload? Put that in the comments.
