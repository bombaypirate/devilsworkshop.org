Now that the excitement over the new iPhone 5 has probably settled, it is time to wonder about the most important question. Should you get yourself an iPhone 5?

Smartphones often get a new incremental model every year, but not everyone buys a new phone every year. I personally average one every 2.5 years. I spoke to some iPhone fans and critics alike and came up with a short analysis on who should actually go ahead and buy one.

[<img class="alignnone  wp-image-62173" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="iPhone5" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/iPhone5.png" alt="" width="506" height="346" />][1]

## Who should Buy the iPhone 5:

### Current iPhone owners

iPhone 5 has a bigger screen and a much faster processor. The specs are great but it is not exactly a path breaking update from its previous version iPhone 4S.

  * If you have an iPhone 4 or its previous versions, then upgrading to an iPhone 5 is a great idea. The phone will be a big improvement from your current phone model.
  * If you are a iPhone fanatic and never miss an upgrade, then you should go right ahead and get a iPhone 5. Chances are you have already pre-ordered it.

### Non iPhone owners

This one is a bit tricky, as a lot of Android phones have really caught up with iPhones. Androidâ€™s Jelly Bean (4.1) OS version is often cited as more advanced that iOS 6 from Apple.

  * Though Android 4.1 is as good as iOS 6 if not better, there is a big issue with fragmentation. If you own a Android phone and are sick of waiting for the latest OS versions being made available for your phone(usually they are at least 4-6 months late), then opting for a iPhone 5 will be a great idea.
  * If you are a BlackBerry or Nokia user but want to move towards touch phone with a great app market. Then chances are you will like upgrading to iPhone 5.

## Who should Not Buy the iPhone 5:

### Current iPhone owners

  * If you have an iPhone 4S, then you might not exactly find upgrading to iPhone 5 very exciting. The new iOS6 version along with improvements to SIRI are already available for the 4S version.
  * The iPhone 5 is an expensive device. In India, it will should cost about INR 44,000. Most popular smartphones from other companies are usually atleast 10% to 15% cheaper.

### Non iPhone Owners

  * Android users who are really into customizing things on their phones, using their phone as a temporary disk drive will be better advised to not get a iPhone 5 which runs on a very closed system.
  * If you are big fans of the Android, BlackBerry or Nokia ecosystem, then it is better to avoid the iPhone 5.

I personally thought that the [magic is missing from iPhone 5][2], compared to it&#8217;s previous versions. I found iPhone 5 a great phone but not exactly a compelling device. So you will have to decide for yourself and see if you find the phone and its apps ecosystem very compelling. Buying a smartphone takes a lot of money, so make sure you buy something that you do not regret later.
