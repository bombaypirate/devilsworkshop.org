That apparently means, the final version of Windows 8 is now available for OEMs to make necessary changes to their existing hardware.

It all started with the <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/watch-microsoft-developers-event-build-live/" target="_blank">BUILD conference</a> in September 2011, and now RTM is a big milestone for Microsoft. The good news is that, if you’re a Technet or MSDN subscriber, you can download the official (and final) version of Windows 8 starting from August 15th.

The public release of Windows 8 will take place on October 26th, to which you can upgrade at a price of 39.99$ (much cheaper than Windows 7 upgrade prices) or by buying a all new Windows 8 PC.

Also, if you’re developer, you can access the final version of Visual Studio 2012 to make apps, and put them in the Windows store (which is still not accessible from the web).

With Microsoft going all Metro, including <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/microsoft-hotmail-replace-outlook/" target="_blank">Outlook.com replacing Hotmail</a> (by the way, get your @outlook.com address before it’s too late!), it’ll be interesting to see <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/microsoft-reports-losses/" target="_blank">how customers will like the new Microsoft</a>.

Mean while, you can always download the Release preview <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview', 'from Microsoft’s site']);" target="_blank">from Microsoft’s site</a>.
