We have another cool trick for all the Facebook lovers. This time we will tell you how you can update your Facebook status or even comment on other&#8217;s statuses with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Underlined</span> or <del>Strikethrough</del> text. Before this I want to clear one thing that writing a text in StrikethroughÂ in MS Word and then copying and pasting it to Facebook won&#8217;t work as both texts have different encoding. Let&#8217;s see the simplest way of doing that.

### Writing in Strikethrough/Underline:

To update a status or post a comment on Facebook in Strikethrough go to <a href="http://crazydavinci.net/tools/strikethrough-text-generator/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://crazydavinci.net/tools/strikethrough-text-generator/', 'this website']);" title="crazydavinci.net"  target="_blank">this website</a>. This is a direct link to the tool which generates the Strikethrough Text. Write the text you want to convert to Strikethrough format in the box 1. and click generate. After that copy whatever text it shows in the box 2. and post it on Facebook. For Strikethrough select &#8216;Format Type&#8217; as &#8216;Horizontal&#8217; on the same page. For Underline select &#8216;Format Type&#8217; as &#8216;Underline&#8217;.

### Result:
