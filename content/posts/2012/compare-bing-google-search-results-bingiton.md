Microsoft has a neat little web tool, that allow users to compare the results between its own Bing search engine and Google. The site is aptly named ***<a href="http://bingiton.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bingiton.com', 'BingItOn.com']);" >BingItOn.com</a>***.

In other words, its a challenge by Bing to Google. It is suggesting that people are using Google not because it has superior results but because it more popular.

The point of the website is let users carry out 5 search queries and get results from Bing and Google side by side.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-61851" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Bingiton_Google_Bing" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/Bingiton_Google_Bing.png" alt="BingItOn: Compare Bing vs Google" width="550" height="351" />][1]

Users then select which results page is better among the two. The trick behind it is users are selecting their their preferred search results without the knowledge of it being from Bing or Google.

I have always wondered if we are [using Google over Bing just out of habit][2], but Google atleast to me, seems to give more relevant and current results compared to Bing.

I took the **BingItOn** face-off and found that Google ended up winning 4 results to 1 for me. But the site does claim that twice the number of users preferred Bing over Google.

I used simple terms like my own name, information on local restaurants, favorite movies, books and musicians.

### Is Bing really better than Google?

In my opinion, I have found Google being very useful especially for local queries and also for looking up news. Google might be better with local results in India compared to Bing as compared to the United States or Europe.

Added advantage to Google is that a lot of people who are using it for search are already logged into the Gmail account. This allows Google to tailor results based on search history of that person.

Give ***BingItOn*** a try and leave the results in your comments. Also let us know if this will encourage you to use Bing instead of Google?
