Apple has started sending out invites to its San Francisco event on 12th September. The event is rumored to be where Apple will showcase the iPhone 5 and possibly iPad mini.

We do not know much about iPad mini, which is expected to be a smaller 7-inch tablet. But if you notice the shadow in the invite, it confirms the iPhone 5.<figure id="attachment_61592" style="width: 512px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

It was no surprise that a new phone would be introduced but some might have wondered if Apple would called it simply “New iPhone”, taking [inspiration from “New iPad”][2].

### Expected features of iPhone 5

  * The phone will run on the latest iOS6 platform.
  * iPhone 5 is expected to be the same screen width of 4.08 inches. The phones though is expected to be taller than its predecessors.
  * There should be a host of improvements with a 12 MP Camera.
  * The phone should ideally be running on a Quad-core process @ 1Ghz.
  * The phone is also expected to have newly design ear plugs by Apple.

What exactly will be known about the iPhone 5, will only be clear next week.
