Facebook notifications are actually meant for getting notified when somebody interacts with you. We get a notification when somebody likes, comments or tags you in a post or even when someone comments on a post after your comment. But most of the times we get useless updates mostly from the applications or groups even if we stopped using them. Lets tell you how you can get only relevant and useful updates in your notifications.

**How to Reduce Facebook Notification Volume!**

  1. First of all open your notifications by clicking on the earth icon given in the top header of Facebook with inbox icon. Now rollover your mouse on the notification that you don&#8217;t wanna see in future and click cross to turn off that notification in future. See the screenshot below:  
    <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68830" title="useless notifications" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/useless-notifications.jpg" alt="useless notifications" width="388" height="151" />Then confirm it by clicking &#8220;Turn off&#8221;.  
    <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68831" title="useless notifications-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/useless-notifications-1.jpg" alt="useless notifications-1" width="352" height="100" />After doing this you won&#8217;t see any further updates from that Application or post. This is the simplest way to unsubscribe from a post.
  2. Secondly go to the page <span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?notifications" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?notifications', 'http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?notifications']);" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?notifications</a>, on this page we have an option of turning off notifications from a particular group or app. For groups, go to &#8220;Group posts&#8221; on the same page and select off for some or all of your groups as shown below:<br /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68832" title="useless notifications-2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/useless-notifications-2.jpg" alt="useless notifications-2" width="584" height="148" />For an app, select &#8220;</span></span></span>Notifications from apps&#8221; on that page and uncheck the box given with every app to unsubscribe:  
    <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-68833" title="useless notifications-3" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/useless-notifications-3-600x203.jpg" alt="useless notifications-3" width="600" height="203" />

That&#8217;s it, now you will get only selected updates. Please note that apart from apps and groups, you can also turn off notification from a post in the same way as given in Step 1. Please drop a comment below for any help.
