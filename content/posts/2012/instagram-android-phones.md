I have always found that iPhone users tend to take great photos from their phones. The reason was not necessarily a great camera but the fact that they had a awesome app called Instagram.

Instagram allows users to share photos online from their phones. But before publishing Instagram allows users to apply several filters on the phone before sharing it on Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr.

Even though Instapaper is a very popular app on iPhone, it was not available for Android phones. Today, Instagram is available on Google Play ([formerly Android Market][1]).

The app is available with Android 2.2 (Froyo) andÂ onwards.

### Bonus Tip on Instagram

If you are an avid Instagram user, you might like to take a trip down memory lane. [Read this post which reviews a online app that sends you details of photos you shared on Instagram from exactly a year ago][2].
