Facebook has <a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150457932027131" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150457932027131', 'introduced']);" >introduced</a> a really cool new feature. It will allow Facebook friends to listen to synchronously played music. This is not just sharing but actually sharing the same song and listening to it at the same time.

This new feature will be rolled out over the next few days for all users. So if you have a friend who is online and listening to a song, you can see a music icon next to their profile photo.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Facebook_music_share" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/01/Facebook_music_share_thumb.png" alt="Facebook_music_share" width="549" height="249" border="0" />][1]

If you hover over that friend’s name in the chat list, a pop-up will show up. Click on ‘***Listen with***’ button to listen to the same music your friend is playing.

If multiple friends join the conversation, all of them can chat and discuss the song as it plays for everyone online.

As a lot of people like to listen to online music and check Facebook with their internet enabled smartphones, this could be a really catchy feature. Hopefully Facebook will make this feature bug free and easy to use.

I think we might see a similar feature for videos very soon, which might be an even better experience. Imagine watching a movie while sharing a conversation with your Facebook friends.

Would you find this feature interesting? Do drop in your comments.
