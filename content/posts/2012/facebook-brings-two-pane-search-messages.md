Facebook has today revamped the UI of Messages, introducing a two-pane view, something you generally see in desktop E-mail clients. The&#8217;ve also brought minor updates to the search feature in it.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-61037" title="Redesigned Facebook Messages" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/08/messenger-1-600x387.png" alt="facebook-messages-redesigned" width="600" height="387" />][1]

One thing that&#8217;s evident is, Facebook wants more people to use Facebook Messages for E-mail, which was then rumored as &#8216;Gmail killer&#8217;. You can also see that they&#8217;re trying to isolate Messages from default Facebook layout (see the screenshot, there&#8217;s no sidebar on the left).

I don&#8217;t think this will in anyway help them in getting more users, honestly, I don&#8217;t know anyone who uses Facebook for E-mail. Heck, I&#8217;m not sure if [Outlook can actually convince][2] considerable number of Gmail users, even with a good product.

Regardless, the new UI looks good with the ability to add multiple photos.

On the other hand, they&#8217;ve made search a little better, as you can now search by sender&#8217;s name or keyword in conversation. For keyboard junkies, Facebook Messages will now support a full list of keyboard shortcuts &#8211; hit Alt (or Control if you&#8217;re on a Mac) + Q key combo to get access to the shortcuts.

Only if they had fixed those long persistent bugs, I&#8217;d use Messages more. The updates seem to be rolling out, I still don&#8217;t have access to it.
