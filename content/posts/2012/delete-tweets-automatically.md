When I created by first Twitter account, it was mainly used to follow other accounts. I ended up writing some tweets without much thought even though I had no followers. Sometime later I did manage to create another Twitter account which I use more prudently as I was using it professionally.

The first account I left alone, still using it to follow tech companies and services. But I had a lot of tweets which I would have preferred to delete for a fresh start. Only problem was that deleting 100s of tweets one by one was tedious.

Thankfully, ***SocialOomph*** a popular online service that allows a lot of automation options to your Twitter and Facebook accounts came up with an option to clean up your Twitter account of all its tweets.

## How to Purge All Tweets from Twitter

  * First, create an account on <a href="http://socialoomph.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://socialoomph.com', 'SocialOomph.com']);" >SocialOomph.com</a> if you do not have one. It is free. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  * Then link your Twitter account to your SocialOomph account and look up options under *Scheduled Updates*.
  * There will be an option to *‘Purge Twitter Tweets’*. Click on it and wait as all your tweets get purged.
  * Once all tweets are deleted, an email is sent as an alert.

So if you are looking for a fresh start for your Twitter account, use this method to clean up all your Tweets.
