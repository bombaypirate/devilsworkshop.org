I am most of you have been familiar with a Inbox full of newletters. Newsletters are not necessarily spam but a lot of us sign up for a newsletter from a service and stop using the service for months or even years but the newsletter keep piling on.

<a href="http://inboxmanager.theswizzle.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://inboxmanager.theswizzle.com', 'Swizzle Inbox Manager']);" >Swizzle Inbox Manager</a> is a great online tool that allows users to quickly unsubscribe from multiple newsletters emails within seconds.

### Inbox Manager Features

  * Just visit ***http://inboxmanager.theswizzle.com*** and enter your email address into it.
  * Now allow it to access your email account.
  * First the online tool, scans your email account and shows you a complete list of email newsletters you can unsubscribe from.
  * Now you can click on the ones which you want to clean out.
  * There are two options, one is just to unsubscribe form the service and the other option actually deletes all previous emails from your account too.

A useful feature of this online tool is that it scans even the old emails from such services which you have unsubscribed from a long time ago. These emails can also be deleted automatically.

Until now I have always used the &#8216;Search&#8217; options with my Gmail and created filters to manage my email. This online tool seems like a more easier and simpler options which does not take a lot of time.
