I love reading books and end up buying many from online stores. I often use [MySmartPrice – a price comparison website to look up lowest price of a particular book][1]. But today, a lot of my online browsing takes place on a mobile phone and so I have started using LowPrice Android App which helps you get the lowest price of a book in India.

### LowPrice&#8217;s Android App Features

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62463" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="LowPrice Android App - Lowest Prices Books in India" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/LowPrice_Books_App_Android.png" alt="LowPrice Android App - Lowest Prices Books in India" width="550" height="506" />][2]

  * The app allows users to search for books by its name, author’s name and publisher’s name.
  * The app works usually great with any barcode scanner app (except Google Googles because of API issues).
  * The app also prompts users to install a default barcode scanner app if your phone does not have one.
  * Using the barcode scanners, users can scan the book details at a library and get its cheapest price online.
  * There is also an option to select books into a wish list.

The online book stores the prices are compared to are Flipkart, Infibeam, HomeShop18 and more. If you are ordering a lot of books online, then this app is a very handy one.

Give it a try and drop in your comments.
