Writing apps are in plenty for Mac. In fact, almost every month a new distraction-free writing app will popup in the Mac Appstore. **Grandview** too is a writing app aiming at simplicity, but it&#8217;s different.<figure id="attachment_61951" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-61951" title="Grandview" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/Grandview2.png" alt="grand-view" width="960" height="530" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Grandview&#8217;s interface</figcaption></figure> 

When you launch Grandview, you get nothing but a white screen, and that is all. It lets you see what you&#8217;re typing, just one word at a time, that&#8217;s the biggest difference between any writing app and Grandview.

Showing one word at a time results in huge font size, so you concentrate in nothing but the text.  Hit **&#8984;=**  (all keyboard shortcuts are customizable) to get the full view.

There&#8217;s no spell correction or word count or markdown support or any other fancy features.

Grandview lives in your Mac&#8217;s menubar, and what ever you type in the app, gets copied to clipboard automatically.

Apparently, it is not a great word processor but can work very well with those. You can customize the font, background color and more in app settings. Just make sure you select a high quality font, because the text is huge in the app.

## Grandview Demo

Here&#8217;s a demo video of the app.



The app is free (it was shareware previously) and can be downloaded from the Mac Appstore.
