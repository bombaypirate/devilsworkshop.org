A few weeks ago we wrote about saving your [Gmail links automatically to a Google Drive][1]. But if you are using Windows, chances are you might be interested in Microsoftâ€™s cloud offering SkyDrive.

Microsoft is collaborating with ***Attachements.me*** for allowing users to upload or download attachments files from their SkyDrive account to Gmail.

### How it works:

  * Download and install the Attachments.me browser extensions from here. It works with Firefox and Chrome.
  * The service will prompt you to connect your Gmail account to SkyDrive account.

  * Now you can use files from SkyDrive while sending emails.

  * You can also download your attachments directly to SkyDrive.

I prefer having SkyDrive installed on my computer too, so the saved attachments are available locally.

Do drop in your comments.
