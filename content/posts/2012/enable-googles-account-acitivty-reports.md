Google has recently [updated it&#8217;s privacy policy][1]. That exercise was to create a single privacy policy instead of 60 different ones. I personally found it to be a good idea. Google was accepting that it did collect data and was using it across services. This was probably its worst kept secret so being more transparent about it made sense.

Today, Google has introduced a new service called ***account activity***. This basically puts together a report on your Google account&#8217;s usage across its various services.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/enable-googles-account-acitivty-reports/account_activity_google/" rel="attachment wp-att-56561"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56561" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="account_activity_google" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/03/account_activity_google.png" alt="" width="600" height="388" /></a>

  * Visit <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/activity" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/settings/activity', 'this link']);" >this link</a> and verify your Google account. Even if you are signed into Gmail, it will still ask for verification as pre-cautionary measure.
  * When you receive the link to the account activity report, go ahead and check out your report.
  * I got some interesting information on how many emails I sent or received in a month or how many people viewed videos I had uploaded on YouTube.

I do not use Google Search when I am signed into my account, so I guess that is why it does not show search related details for the month. Otherwise it is supposed to show details regarding your search queries too.

It also gives a quick idea of which platforms and browsers were used to access your Google account. This can be handy to catch suspicious activity on your Google account.

Do drop in your comments.
