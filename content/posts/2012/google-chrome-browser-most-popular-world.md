Browsers war at the desktop level seemed to be getting predictable. Developers might still swear by Firefox and some older Windows versions like XP, still have Internet Explorer as its best bet, most people are generally in adopting Chrome.

According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-weekly-201109-201221" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-weekly-201109-201221', 'StatCounter']);" >StatCounter</a>, Chrome has overtaken Internet Explorer to become the most used browser worldwide.

Usage of Chrome is apparently 31.88% which is a slime lead over Internet Explore which has 31.49%.

One might wonder where Firefox is in this race, it is at third spot with approximately 26% usage.

### What could stop Chrome?

Chrome does not give features or options which are entirely very different from say Firefox and dare I say even Internet Explorer. The difference lies in the simplicity of its options. The sync features, which can not just sync bookmarks and extensions but also browsing history or [open tabs][1].

Lately, [Chrome is now available on Android][2] and it is already seeing millions of installs very month. If [Chrome makes it debut on iOS][3] as expected, it might soon leave all other browser very far behind.

The only thing that could stop Chrome seems to be Google itself, just like Microsoft did with Internet Explorer, when they became complacent and stopped improving the browser.

What are your views on Chrome dislodging IE as the most popular browser? Do drop in your comments.
