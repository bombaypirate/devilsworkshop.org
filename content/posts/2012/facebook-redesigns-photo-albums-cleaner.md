Once again Facebook changed the way we see photos on it and this time the change is pretty good. They have changed the theme of photos and its album. Now Facebook shows much bigger photo thumbnails with a cleaner design. Also there are some newly added features like featured photo, direct likes and comments e.t.c. Let&#8217;s have a look at these newly added features.

### Design:

A clean four column design for photos and three column for albums look way better than the previous one. You can also browse tagged, and recent photos/albums easily just with a single click. Check out the screenshots below:

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-63177" title="photo view" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/photo-view-600x300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300" />][2]

### Slideshow:

Now you can rollover your mouse cursor on an album to see slideshow of the pics in that album. It&#8217;s definitely a useful and interesting feature.

### Highlight your photo:

Love a particular picture? Now you can highlight a picture easily with a single click. Highlighting a pic will show a bigger thumbnail of that picture in photos.

### Easily Add Location and Details:

Now you don&#8217;t have to open every single picture to edit it or add a location. You can do it without opening it as well.

### Liking and Commenting:

Loved someone else&#8217;s pic? Now you can like or comment on the thumbnail itself without opening it.

Facebook also started showing faces using face detection for tagging friends. Personally I love these features a lot mainly because it&#8217;s not confusing and easy to use with a clean interface. Don&#8217;t forget to share your views with us.
