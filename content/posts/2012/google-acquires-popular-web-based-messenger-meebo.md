Meebo is a web based chat client which allows users to chat online in a single place from various different accounts like ICQ, Google, MSN and more. Meebo saw a great deal of popularity for people tired of lack of compatibility between traditional instant messengers.

Meebo lately has also, created a web-based toolbar which allows users to share web pages across different websites.

According to <a href="http://www.meebo.com/about/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meebo.com/about/', 'Meebo']);" >Meebo</a>, they reach approximately half of US population. This is what has in all probability caught the attention of Google.

Meebo has <a href="http://blog.meebo.com/?p=4974" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.meebo.com/?p=4974', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that it is now a part of Google.

### What will happen to Meebo?

As usual, after a buyout most times things are a little uncertain about the continuity of a company&#8217;s product.Â It will be interesting to see in the future if Meebo retains its compatibility with Facebook, especially given that Facebook and Google+ are competitors.

Another factor is Meebo also has a web based advertising platform, which be rolled into Google AdSense.
