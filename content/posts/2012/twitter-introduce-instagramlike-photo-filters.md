Twitter is one of those companies which says that they&#8217;re very different from their competitors, but in reality, they are the same. As you know, [Facebook bought Instagram][1] for a whopping $1 Billion. Probably, in some point in future, Facebook is going to integrate/merge Instagram into it.

Ironically, Instagram photos are generally more popular on Twitter than Facebook, this probably made Twitter to get photo filters into its social network &#8211; as the NYTimes points it out.

Twitter is more of a mobile-thing for everyone and now that smartphones are equipped with super-high-resolution cameras, it does make sense. Path, for example, had these photo filters built-in.

Personally, I don&#8217;t think it will hamper Instagram in any way. Because, content on Twitter is short-term, it won&#8217;t be forever. Apart from that, Instagram has a great community of photographers which isn&#8217;t easy to find on Twitter.

They also seem to add video uploading and editing features, without needing you to get on to YouTube.

Apparently, these features may not keep the simplicity which Twitter is known for and they should do something about it.
