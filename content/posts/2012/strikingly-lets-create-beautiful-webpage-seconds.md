Chances are you don&#8217;t really know web designing, but you want to create a little website for you &#8211; which can act as a landing page or even a resume/portfolio of you.

While there are many website builders available on the web, most of them aren&#8217;t simple or free or not quick. **Striking.ly** wants to change this.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/Striking.ly_.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-62152" title="Striking.ly dashboard" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/Striking.ly_.png" alt="strikingly-dashboard" width="1010" height="365" /></a>
</p>

Creating a webpage is really simple &#8211; to get started, you need to signup for a free account. After you do that, you&#8217;ll be shown around six predesigned templates (which are really neat) for your webpage.

Hit preview to see how the template looks, select it and you&#8217;ll be asked for details like page name, URL etc.

You can edit pretty much anything on the template &#8211; including text, images, videos etc. Though, you won&#8217;t be able to edit the HTML source. You can also do some SEO like adding meta tags, page description etc.

The service is free, but there&#8217;s also a Pro version available which will let you access features like custom domain, Google Analytics, more bandwidth storage, etc. The free version will be enough for starters.
