Five years ago, I was not on Facebook or Twitter. MySpace was not something I cared of either. Social networking meant being on Orkut. Orkut was special because as a popular social product in India, it actually ended up getting me in touch with my friends from school.

Lately, I have not checked my Orkut profile for months on end while I check my other social profiles atleast once daily.

Today, Orkut <a href="http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#CommMsgs?cmm=95114051&tid=5747950476537944237" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#CommMsgs?cmm=95114051&tid=5747950476537944237', 'rolled out']);" >rolled out</a> a new feature that allows users to link their Google+ profiles with their Orkut profiles.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/enable-publishing-google-posts-orkut-profile/gplus_orkut_link/" rel="attachment wp-att-58401"><img class="size-full wp-image-58401 alignnone" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px;" title="Linking Orkut Profile" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/05/gplus_Orkut_link.png" alt="" width="550" height="421" /></a>

Login to your Orkut account and ideally you should see the option to link it with your Google+ account as seen in the screenshot above.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/enable-publishing-google-posts-orkut-profile/orkut_permission_gplus/" rel="attachment wp-att-58404"><img class="size-full wp-image-58404 alignnone" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Orkut_Permission_gplus" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/05/Orkut_Permission_gplus.png" alt="" width="550" height="321" /></a>

Now Allow your Google+ public posts to be published on Orkut.

You will notice that your old Orkut profile image has been replaced with the one from Google+.

### Is it the end of Orkut?

Considering Orkut still has millions of active users and Google+ is still relatively modestly successful, I did not really think Orkut would be closed down by Google. But options like this one and also other previous features like [importing photos from Orkut to Google+][1] actually allow users to sort of co-opt Orkut into their Google+ profile. Orkut might not close down anytime soon but it seems like the beginning of the end for it.
