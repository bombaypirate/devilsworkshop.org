Almost a month ago, I wrote about [KumoSync, a software that syncs folders and files from your computer onto Google Docs][1]. This works well to backup files to Google Docs, which in turns acts as cloud storage.

With ***InSync***, one can download all your Google Docs Folders and files onto your computer and sync them on any other computer you have. This includes Windows and Mac OS X while a Linux version is expected soon.

## InSync Features

  * Simply visit the <a href="https://www.insynchq.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.insynchq.com', 'InSync website']);" >InSync website</a> and download the software.
  * Sign-in to your Google credentials into the software.Â This will open a page on your browser which shows all the files that are being synced from Google Docs to your computer.
  * If you have another computer at work, install InSync software and use the same Google account to show store all the files on the second computer.
  * This way you can use edit documents on either of the 2 computers or even from Google Docs directly and have them perfectly in sync with each other.

### Why Not Use DropBox instead?

I love using [Dropbox to synchronize documents and photos][3] from one computer to another. Get a new computer, just use Dropbox to all your important files back. But Dropbox does not seem to support Google Docs, and that is where I found InSync a lot more interesting.

Ofcourse the advantage with Dropbox is that it does not tie you down to a Google account.

Do try out InSync and drop in your comments.
