There&#8217;s a feature in Facebook messages where you have an option of starting a group message thread. In such message conversations anyone can post a message in that thread which will be delivered to all of the members of that conversation.

This is a useful feature but most of the times it ends up spamming the inbox. Unfortunately deleting the thread is not going to work as it will start showing the thread again once somebody posts a reply.

This is a quick post for solution of this problem; here is how you can get rid of such conversations:

**1. **Open the conversation in your inbox.

**2.** Now click on &#8220;Actions&#8221; button on the top of that conversation and select &#8220;Leave Conversation&#8230;&#8221;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-58756" title="leave facebook conversation" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/06/leave-facebook-conversation.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="371" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  3. Then you will see a message &#8220;You will stop receiving messages from this conversation and people will see that you left.&#8221; Click &#8220;Leave Conversation&#8221; again to confirm.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
