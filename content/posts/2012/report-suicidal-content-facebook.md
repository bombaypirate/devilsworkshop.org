If you or your friend is depressed and needs an online help then Facebook is a good medium for that. With a feature on Facebook you can report any content that your friend has posted to Facebook directly or alternatively you can contact the local authority for the same.

### To Report the Suicidal content directly to Facebook:

If you want to report some suicidal content from your friend&#8217;s profile or someone you know but that person isn&#8217;t there in your friend&#8217;s list then you can use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=suicidal_content" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=suicidal_content', 'this form']);" target="_blank">this form</a>. In the form add the name of that person in the first box, his/her profile link or search link in the second box and add comments or the suicidal content in the third box and submit it to Facebook.
