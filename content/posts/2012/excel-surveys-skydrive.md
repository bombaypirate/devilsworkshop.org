Microsoft on its blog, today announced a new feature with SkyDrive. The new feature will allow users to create Excel based surveys which can be useful to plan events or projects.

**How Excel Surveys work:**

  * Simply login to your SkyDrive account online at <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://skydrive.live.com/', 'https://skydrive.live.com/']);" title="https://skydrive.live.com/"><em>https://skydrive.live.com/</em></a>.
  * Click on create button at the top and select “Excel Survey” from the dropdown.

  * Name the survey and create a questionnaire.

  * The file can then be shared with anyone via a short URL. All the data entered and collected through the survey is neatly tabulated into a excel file.

Google Drive (previously Docs) also has a similar option of creating questionnaires and collecting information in a feature called ‘Forms’.

I have personally not been able to test out Excel Survey completely for all its features as Microsoft will be rolling it out over the day. If I find something, I will surely update it here or in a new post.
