The battle of the browsers is getting less fascinating in recent times and that is because Chrome seems to be simply unstoppable. [Google Chrome overtook Internet Explorer to become the most used browser][1] a couple of months ago, pushing out Internet Explorer to second place for the first time ever.Â  Lately even [Microsoft has accepted that Internet Explorer was pretty much the browser everone loved to hate][2].

According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201107-201207" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201107-201207', 'StatCounter']);" >StatCounter</a>, Chrome now has breached the important 33.33% mark.

It means that now very 1 in 3 internet user is using Chrome. The rise of Chrome is even more incredible when you consider it did not have a captive platform to grow on, unlike Safari and Internet Explorer. Maybe, if Windows 8 is a super-hit, then Internet Explorer might actually start making a turn around and arrest the slide in its numbers.

Chrome might be late into the game as a mobile phone browser, but it has started catching up with being available for [Android][4] and [iOS][5] users.

Are you a Chrome user? Do you think its rise could be challenged or stopped? Do drop in your comments.
