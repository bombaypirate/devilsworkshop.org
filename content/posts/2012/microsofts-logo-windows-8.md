Logos are probably the most important identity of a brand. That is why even when companies change their logo, they do not opt for a complete break from the past. As you might know the Microsoft is busy building Windows 8, which might [show up on tablets, mobile phones and PCs later this year][1]. Microsoft has been developing Window 8 with metro-styled tiled layout. This is astheitcally very pleasing and having uniformity in user-interface across different devices is a good idea.

Microsoft today <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/02/17/redesigning-the-windows-logo.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/02/17/redesigning-the-windows-logo.aspx', 'unveiled']);" >unveiled</a> the new logo for Windows 8. It is going to raise a few eye brows as it has done away with the 4 coloured flag logo and opted for a single coloured logo.

### Windows Logos through time

Here is a quick timelime of all the previous logos for Windows. It is interesting to note that with the Windows 8 logo has a lot of similarity with the logo of Windows 1.0.

I am not certain why they did away with the familiarity of 4 coloured scheme but I guess a simple logo with a single color scheme would make it a lot easier for manufactures to print the brand logos on mobile phones and tablets.

I sort of like the new logo but not sure how it will look on the OS. What are your views? Are you happy with the new Windows logo?
