Facebook today has announced a new feature on its mobile phone apps for iPhones and Android phones. It is called PhotoSync and like it&#8217;s name, it allows users to automatically upload their photos on Facebook from their phones.

If you current have a Android or iPhone, then open the Facebook app. You can see the photos section (image below) from the navigation menu.<figure id="attachment_68992" style="width: 550px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

The photos section should show up a sync option. Select it to sync your photos that are on your phone to Facebook.

### Privacy on Photo Syncing by Facebook

Facebook sets the privacy of all synced photos to private. That means only the user can view these photos. Later you can select a bunch of photos from among the “Private” album and share it in a post with select friends.

The current storage limit for “synced photos” is 2 GB.

Automatic uploading of photos from Camera to a a website is not exactly a new idea. Google+ has long ago implemented this idea. Dropbox too has a similar service to allow any [mobile phone connected with computer to sync photos][2].

Are you comfortable with the syncing all your photos automatically on Facebook? Do drop in your comments.
