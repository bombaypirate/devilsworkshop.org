Since Google Drive was launched earlier this year, I use it a lot of creating and sharing documents. I even use it to store photos, slideshow presentations and home videos. Since today, users can share their files from Google Drive directly to their Google+ accounts and others can view these files directly from their Google+ feeds.

**How it works:**

  * Choose a file from your Google Drive account. Now click on share option for the file.

<div>
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/Google_Drive_Google+_Share.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-67737" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Google_Drive_Google+_Share" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/Google_Drive_Google+_Share.png" alt="" width="552" height="372" /></a>
</div>

  * It will allow users options to share the file using various platforms like Gmail, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter. If you select Google+, others can directly look at the content of your file from Google+ itself. That means, users do not have to leave Google+ or download the fileÂ separately.

<div>
  <a href="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/Google_Drive_Google+_View.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-67738" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Google_Drive_Google+_View" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/11/Google_Drive_Google+_View.png" alt="" width="394" height="332" /></a>
</div>

  * So basically if I was sharing my birthday video with some Google+ friends, I can simply share the link into my Google+ profile and friends can steam the video from their feed directly.

This was needed mainly as Google+ can also double up as an internal social network for app accounts. So sharing files with many collaborators can be very useful.

It is a great time for cloud storage and sync users as [Dropbox has also pushed through a lot of new features like video streaming on Android phones][1] and with [Windows 8 leveraging SkyDrive][2] expect a lot more from Microsoft too.

Which one of the cloud sync and storage services do you use? Do drop in your comments.
