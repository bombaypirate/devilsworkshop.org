It can be reasonable to expect a LG Nexus 4 phone, Nexus 7 tablet with 32 GB memory and 3G and possibly a larger tablet called Nexus 10.

The biggest news is that all these devices will be running on **Android 4.2, namely Key Lime Pie**.

After the highly appreciated Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean), the next version will obviously need a lot more new features.

Here is a list of expected features from Android 4.2.

### Android 4.2 Expected Features

  * **Mutiple User profiles for tablets:** Android 4.2 will have the much needed support for mutiple profiles. The idea is that it will allow two or three users to have their own profiles on a tablet to login and use their own choice of apps and customizations.
  * **New Gmail App:** The Key Lime Pie will ship with a new Gmail app which supports pinch to zoom and swipe to archive features taking advantage of the muti-touch devices. This will be like a stock app for Nexus users like the [stand-alone Google Calendar app][3].
  * **Notification Center: **The notification center of Android is where it has thoroughly outclassed iOS for a while and it is reasonable to expect more improvements. The notifications will show full messages instead of just part of it and more functions that can be carried out from the notifications UI itself.
  * **Google Now: **Google Now will be improved with cards popping up telling you about people and locations of interest where you are along with features like telling you how much you walked and more.
  * **Other Improvements: **The other improvements expected are mainly UI improvements to Cameras and the photo gallery.

We will have to wait and see how Google will try to steal the thunder of Apple which is also [expected to show up with smaller iPad tablet][4] and some even suggest a peek at iTV. Also the rumours about Android 4.2 could be just rumours, but Google will surely unveil something important.

All said and done, it is a great time to be a customer.
