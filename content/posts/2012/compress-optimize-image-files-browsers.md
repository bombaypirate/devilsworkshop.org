Images can take up a lot of bandwidth while being viewed on a website. It could also affect the loading speed for your website, if it has many large sized images. Also if you are into web designing, then you might like downloading all images from a particular page you are viewing.

<a href="http://kraken.io/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kraken.io/', 'Kraken']);" >Kraken</a> is a free online tool that has mixed both features and allows users to download all images from a webpage and while doing so also optimize them with resizing.
