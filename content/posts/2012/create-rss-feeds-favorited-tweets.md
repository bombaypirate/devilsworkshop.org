Twitter seems to be a continous stream of information and it is rather difficult to keep track of some important tweets that you liked or would like to get back to at a later time.

One way to keep track of an important tweet is to favorite it. This way you can get back to it anytime you want and do not need to use Twitter&#8217;s search feature which is not exactly great.

### Creating a RSS Feed of Favorite Tweets

I personally like following things I am interested with Google Reader and I tried to search for quick way to create RSS feeds out of all the tweets I mark as favorite.

Thankfully, Twitter itself has a great feature which is not as well known to create RSS feeds of any user&#8217;s favourite tweets.

For example, if you want a RSS feed of our blog&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/devils_workshop" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/devils_workshop', 'Twitter account (@Devils_Workshop )']);" >Twitter account (@Devils_Workshop )</a> just use the method described below.

> ***http:******/******/twitter******.com******/favorites******/devils_workshop.rss***

Just replace ***&#8220;devils_workshop&#8221;*** into any account&#8217;s username to created the desired RSS feed.

### Archiving Favorite Tweets to Evernote

If you like saving notes on Evernote then this Ifft feature is a great way to archive all your favorite tweets to your Evernote account.

Just visit the this <a href="http://ifttt.com/recipes/9172" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ifttt.com/recipes/9172', 'ifttt link']);" >ifttt link</a> and connect your Twitter and Evernote accounts. It will automatically archive all your favorite tweets to Evernote. Do note you will have to create a ifttt account.
