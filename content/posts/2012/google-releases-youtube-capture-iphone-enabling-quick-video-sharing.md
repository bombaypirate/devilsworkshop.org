While there&#8217;s Instagram for quick photo sharing, there&#8217;s isn&#8217;t such a product for video sharing. Though YouTube is available on mobiles, the process of uploading videos from the app isn&#8217;t streamlined, and hence Google has released YouTube Capture.

The whole point of the app is to shoot videos and share them quickly before the moment is gone, because &#8211; you know, life&#8217;s fast.

The process is really straight forward &#8211; you open the app, shoot a video, after which you add a caption and share it among social networks (here you can actually share it on Facebook and Twitter, not just Google+).

There are few neat features included like video stabilisation which will be really useful for editing shaky videos. There&#8217;s also colour correction and ability to add free background music.

## Too much iOS love?

One thing which has surprised me a bit is that, Android version of YouTube Capture is yet to come &#8211; Google has confirmed that <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.in/2012/12/film-and-share-videos-instantly-with.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://youtube-global.blogspot.in/2012/12/film-and-share-videos-instantly-with.html', 'in their blog post']);" >in their blog post</a>. With updated Google search, Gmail, Google Maps and now YouTube Capture, iOS seems to be getting a lot of Google love, lately.



Try out the app and tell us what you think.
