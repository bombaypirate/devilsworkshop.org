A couple of days back, topÂ socialÂ networking website added a new and a very clever feature. As usual there was no official information about this feature as they have not updated their official blog since January &#8217;12. The new feature is related to the messages you send to your friends.

This feature is just like the delivery reports of SMS on our mobile phone but we can say it as an advanced version of it. Now whenever you&#8217;ll send a message to your friend, you will see a text at the bottom of chat window which will show you the time when your friends reads your message. If it&#8217;s not showing anything that means your message is still unread. See the pic below:

Here the 1 shows that the message is delivered and read by my friend at 4:36AM but the 2 shows that the message is delivered (as there was no error message) but the message is still unread. This new feature is only available in the chat box and if your are chattingÂ offlineÂ from your inbox then you need to open your chat window. There is no need to be online on chat to use it.

So next time be careful if you&#8217;re ignoring someone&#8217;s messages on Facebook. ðŸ˜‰ Don&#8217;t forget to share it with your friends. Stay connected for more [Facebook][1] related stuff.
