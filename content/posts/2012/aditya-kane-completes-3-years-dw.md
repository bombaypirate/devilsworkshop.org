Dear DW readers,

It seems like ages that I have posted an editorial here!

## Aditya Kane completes 3 years!

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/author/adityakane/" rel="attachment wp-att-61382"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-61382" title="Aditya-Kane" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/08/Aditya-Kane.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Well, I feelÂ ashamed to share this good news little late!

[Aditya Kane][1], our Editor-in-Chief has completed 3 years with Devils Workshop 3 days back (on August 26)

Thanks Aditya forÂ safeguardingÂ DW against all spammers and greedy evils.Â I don&#8217;t care what Google Analytics, Alexa or AdSense stats tell about your performance.

Pride cannot be measured by any tool andÂ I am proud to have you as Editor-in-Chief at DW&#8230; <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### My Status Update!

From last few weeks, I am finding some time to purse my oldest hobby i.e. writing here on Devils Workshop.Â I [posted few articles][2] recently mostly on Ubuntu and server-administration stuff. Well these things are what I am doing these days mainly. I always find it hard to write about things that I am not involved in. So in future you may not read about windows, facebook, social-media, wordpress-coding from me.

I am heading <a href="http://rtcamp.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com/', 'a wordpress company']);" >a wordpress company</a> but on daily basis I am not coding anything on WordPress since long. So no wordpress-coding articles from me! I spend my free time with Ubuntu, Nginx and sever administration stuff. Also, I am learning Ruby (and Rails). So my articles will be mostly related to this&#8230;

### Things that are changing&#8230;

As I am finding some time to spend here on DW, we restored our support forum back. Feel free to use it &#8211;Â <http://devilsworkshop.org/support/>. I will try to personally answer any query related to my knowledge domain within 24-hours (except weekends!) I am married now, so weekends are sometimes reserved&#8230; ðŸ˜‰

To reduce load on Aditya&#8217;s shoulders, our Editor-in-Chief, we have changed our contact page with new guidelines. Updated contact page is here &#8211; <http://www.devilsworkshop.org/contact>

We already removed most ads except Google AdSense. In our continuedÂ attemptÂ to enhance reading experience onÂ DW, we may remove few more stuff (ads, widgets, etc) in coming days.
