In just a couple of days after the announcement of Official Account of Indian Prime Minister&#8217;s Office, more than 20,000 Twitter users have started following it. Just like the official page of Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh on Facebook, this twitter account will also give regular updates of Prime Minister&#8217;s speeches, programs,  photos, tours and other official news in real-time. This official account of PMO will be managed and updated by TV journalist Pankaj Pachauri who&#8217;s newly appointed Communications Adviser to the Prime Minister.
