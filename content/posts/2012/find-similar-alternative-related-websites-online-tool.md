Lately, I have started spending a lot of time on Flipkart to keep track of a certain books I am interested in buying. Usually I end up using [MySmartPrice for the cheapest options][1].

That said I wanted to look for a good list of all similar online retail services in India. A great online tool to get similar or alternative websites for a particular one is <a href="http://www.websiteslike.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.websiteslike.org/', 'Websites Like']);" >Websites Like</a>.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/find-similar-alternative-related-websites-online-tool/websites_like_org/" rel="attachment wp-att-56966"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56966" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="websites_like_org" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/websites_like_org.png" alt="" width="726" height="534" /></a>

### Websites Like Features

  * The website features a search feature. Just type in the keyword to find related websites.
  * If you want to find similar websites, just append the site address to ***http://www.websiteslike.org/site/ ***. For example ***http://www.websiteslike.org/site/devilsworkshop.org ***will give out results of sites that are similar to our blog.
  * The website claims that it has alternatives for over 1 million websites. I must say that sometimes the most obvious results are missing. For example, when I type in &#8220;Google Search&#8221; it does not return Bing but a host of SEO and Google related websites. Then again, users would not be looking for the most obvious results anyways.

It would have been nice to have a search bookmarklet or Chrome extension to make it easy to use Websites Like on the fly. Unfortunately at the moment I will just have to bookmark this one for now.

Do try out Websites Like and drop in your comments.
