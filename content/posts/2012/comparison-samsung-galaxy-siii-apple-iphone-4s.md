Samsung&#8217;s [Galaxy S3 was unveiled at the beginning of the month][1]. Yesterday, Samsung announced the official launch of Galaxy S3 in India. The phone has been highly anticipated. The initial price was revealed to be Rs. 43,180.

That price seemed a tad to high and lately most online retail websites are showing the prices as **Rs. 38,900/-**

### Specs

Usually I do not expect a lot to be different between the two phones. In recent times apps and features seem to be the big difference in the smartphone category.

  * Galaxy S3 does come with only 16 GB but supports expansion upto 128 GB. iPhone&#8217;s memory cannot be expanded.iPhone 4S has a storage space of 64 GB at the maximum.
  * The screen on the Galaxy S3 has 4.8 inch display. It has a resolution of 1280 X 780. iPhone has a 3.5 screen with resolution of 960 X 640.
  * The iPhone 4S has a A5 processor while Galaxy S3 has Exynos 4 Quad processor which is nearly twice as fast.

### Android vs iOS

  * Galaxy S3 has Android 4.0 (ICS) running on it. ICS has been considered the best of Android to date. Samsung took a really long time pushing an upgrade to its previous models like Galaxy S2 and Galaxy Note.
  * Apple&#8217;s iPhone 4S runs on iOS 5.1. Usually most users can upgrade to a new OS version within a day after it is made available by Apple.

This difference is mainly because Android is highly customized by Samsung for it&#8217;s phones and hence it takes them time to initiate a updated version.

### Availability

Samsung unveiled Galaxy S3 on 4th May while its already available in India inside a month. Apple is usually a lot slower introducing their products in India.

Galaxy S3 will be available at most mobile phone retailers and also will be available on a majority of online retail shops.

iPhone 4S is usually not available officially on any online retail website in India.

### Price

The price of a phone in India can literally make or break it. This is where Samsung has a big advantage over Apple. Apple&#8217;s iPhone 4S is priced from Rs. 42,000 onwards. The price of Galaxy S3 as I mentioned earlier is Rs. 38,900.

### Final words on the iPhone 4S vs Galaxy S3 debate

All said and done it looks like the Galaxy S3 is a much better phone. It also is a lot more powerful but it remains to be seen if that better processor ends up being a battery hog.

But it should be noted that Galaxy S3 is not really a competitor to iPhone 4S. It will eventually compete with iPhone 5. With Apple expected to launch iPhone 5 later in the year, it could be worthwhile to do a comparative analysis then. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
