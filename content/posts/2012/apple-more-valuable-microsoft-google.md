Revenue and sale numbers are out for Apple. The total valuation of this company now stands at **$413 billion**.

It replaced Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company for a while until their places were interchanged due to the day&#8217;s trading. In valuation terms, Apple is way ahead of tech giants like Microsoft and Google.

Microsoft is valued at **$249 billion**, while Google is at a much lower **$146 billion**. That means if the valuations of Microsoft and Google were combined it would be $395 billion. That is still below Apple’s $413 billion.

### Apple’s Incredible Year

  * Apple has continued its good performance from last year, when it [overtook Microsoft in terms of profitability][2].
  * More than just the market valuation, Apple also has cash reserves of almost a $100 billion. That means if tomorrow the Apple board decides it could buy out Dell and HP together and still have some money left.
  * It also has enough money to completely buy out the social network Facebook. As Facebook has not had a IPO, its market value cannot be easily calculated but it is estimated to be valued around $90 billion.

### Less is more

  * The most amazing part of Apple’s growth in the past 2 years has been that it does not have a host of products and services. Products like iPhone, iPod, iPads and their App store is what is driving all this revenues.
  * Also considering it sells devices which are considered expensive and a bit of a luxury, it still has grown despite the economic recession in the US and Europe. It seems Apple is recession proof.

It seems Steve Job’s philosophy of concentrating on a handful of products instead of several, has paid off BIG. Also with iPhone 5 and iPad 3 expected in the year 2012, it could mean there is no stopping Apple at least for the next couple of years.
