### Internet Censorship and Content Removal Requests!

Usual assumption is that when a government increases the number of content removal requests from Google, it is trying to clamp down on the internet. Internet censorship has recently grabbed many headlines in India with [ministers demanding manual scanning of all content on social media][2], to courts threathening to [ban social media websites][3].

Just over a week ago, many Indian cities had protests against online censorship[,][4] [egged on by the popular hacktivist group Anonymous][4].

Interestingly, India is not the only country to see a spurt in government requested content removal requests. United States also increased the number of requests from 92 to 187.
