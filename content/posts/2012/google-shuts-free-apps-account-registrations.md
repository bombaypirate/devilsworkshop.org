I was sent a email by Google that they would be discontinuing new sign-up of their free version of Google apps. While many people are using the paid version of Google apps, these free app accounts were a favorite of small business owners.

So here is how app users stand. Both **paid** and **free** versions of Google app accounts will remain intact. Only new sign-ups will not be allowed.

Currently the apps accounts is offering upto $50 per user for the whole year. For Indian users they are offering the same package at INR 2700/-

This price is a little too high but I think many small business owners will still sign-up.

### Why is Google shutting out Free Apps account?

While some websites are suggesting that Google makes revenues upto $1 billion from its App accounts offerings. It still has a several million users who are using the free version. Google app accounts is not just about the email but also offers Google Drive, Google Reader, Google+ and other Google related products. It might also be planning to bring out more offerings to compete better with Microsoft&#8217;s Enterprise solutions.

By the way if you are the worrying kind and want to move your [Google+ circles and followers from app account to Gmail, so check this tutorial out][2].
