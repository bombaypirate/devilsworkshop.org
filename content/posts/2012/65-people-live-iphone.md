I have heard of iPhone users falling in love with their phone. But the true extent of iPhone craze can be only understood, when a survey shows up that 65% users cannot live without their iPhones. Smartphones purchases also are affecting other types of gadgets. For example 60% of iPhone users will not buy a MP3 players and 55% users will not buy a camera.

Here are more such interesting statistics about smartphones and their users in a infographic by <a href="http://www.couponaudit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.couponaudit.com/', 'Coupon Audit']);" >Coupon Audit</a>.
