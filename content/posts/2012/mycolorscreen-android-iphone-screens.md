Customization is one of the best things about Android. You can do so many things to make the device yours, without even rooting it. Sure, iPhone users can customize too, but jailbreaking is too much of a hassle. So, if you have an Android or a jailbroken iPhone (because, you can’t do much with the stock), you got to check **MyColorScreen**.

### MyColorScreen Features

  * MyColorScreen is like a network for smartphone geeks, sharing their beautiful customized homescreens.
  * The site is neatly designed with a Pinterest-like layout, you get to see what the uploader has used to make the screen i.e. widgets, wallpapers, icons and all.
  * You can of course sign up for the site, and upload your screens, who knows you can become popular in no time.
  * You can also follow people with popular screens (or from your Facebook network), and look at trending screens, sorted by OS.

The site can be a great resource for wallpapers (and apps, too), some are really neat. If you follow news with a  feed reader, you can subscribe to respective feeds.

For people who customize their home-screen frequently, this can be great for inspiration. Rather than searching for screens on sites like DeviantArt, it’s great to have a dedicated site.
