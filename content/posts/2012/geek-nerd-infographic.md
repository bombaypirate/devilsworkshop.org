I have always found both terms quite similar except that being called a ‘geek’ was cooler than being called a ‘nerd’. <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Here is a nice <a href="http://www.mastersinit.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mastersinit.org/', 'infographic by Masters in IT']);" >infographic by Masters in IT</a>, that tries to define the difference between a ‘Geek’ and ‘Nerd’.

It does so by some interesting differences in tastes and professions chosen by people who are called one of the two terms.

So what are you? A geek or a nerd? Do drop in your comments.
