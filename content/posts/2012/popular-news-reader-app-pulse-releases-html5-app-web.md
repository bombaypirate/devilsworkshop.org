Android and iPhone users are familiar with Pulse, a gorgeous news reader app providing an interactive way to consume news. Till now, Pulse wasn&#8217;t available on the web, except that you could able to read your &#8216;saved&#8217; articles online.

But not anymore, the team behind this app has made a slick HTML5 app which is also part of Microsoft&#8217;s IE 10 marketing campaign (along with Cut The Rope).

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The app sports responsive design, which means it will work on any device, from 3.5&#8243; smartphone to a 27&#8243; monitor. You can add popular blogs to your feed and also categorize them.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The app lets you customize the layout, and also you can save articles for later. If you&#8217;ve an iPhone/Android, make sure you install Pulse app, which will be in perfect sync with the webapp.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  There&#8217;s no way to add blogs through an OPML file, which can be a big problem if you subscribe to a lot of blogs. I can make out that the app is not suitable for power users, because it&#8217;s not exactly a RSS reader nor is it as productive as Google Reader.

  On a side note, if you&#8217;re a web designer/developer who wants to know how they were able to port the app to web, check out <a href="http://www.pulse.me/app/dev" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pulse.me/app/dev', 'Pulse&#8217;s blog post']);" >Pulse&#8217;s blog post</a>.

## Pulse on IE10

As shown in the video, Pulse looks amazing on IE10 on Surface tablet &#8211; it&#8217;s fully optimized for touch and blends with the metro layout.
