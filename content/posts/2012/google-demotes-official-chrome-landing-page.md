Google has aggressively promoted its browser Chrome, across television, print and internet media. A <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-jaw-dropping-sponsored-post-campaign-for-chrome-106348" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://searchengineland.com/googles-jaw-dropping-sponsored-post-campaign-for-chrome-106348', 'recent look']);" >recent look</a> at the search query *&#8220;this post is sponsored by Google Chrome&#8221; *gives thousands of results.

This lead to questions about the practice of Google Chrome was buying links from bloggers to promote the landing page to download Chrome with a link. This practice is discouraged by Google itself.

Ideally the paid link should have had the ***NoFollow tag*** that indicates to Google it was a paid link.

***Matt Cutts*** the head of Google web spam team, put out a <a href="https://plus.google.com/109412257237874861202/posts/NAWunDzJSHC" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/109412257237874861202/posts/NAWunDzJSHC', 'post']);" >post</a> explaining the action Google would be taking. In a quote, Cutts explains the action that Google Web Spam team will take against paid links by Google Chrome.

> In response, the webspam team has taken manual action to demote ***www.google.com/chrome*** for at least 60 days..

If you now search for the query ***‘Browser’*** or ***‘Chrome’*** the landing page for Chrome does not show up in the first few results at all. I decided to check the best query for the landing page to show up first which was ***‘Download Google Chrome’. ***

Yes, even if Google has demoted a link to their landing page, they have promoted with an sponsored link.

### Will it have an impact on Chrome?

No. Chrome is already a very popular browser and it might have a small impact on the number of downloads. Anyways if the download link still shows up as a sponsored link so that might not really impact its downloads.

This will probably add to the confusion over how and when one should use ***nofollow*** tags on links.

On the other hand, I am glad to see Google own up to its mistake and be transparent about what has happened instead for trying to cover up (which usually end up in further embarrassments).
