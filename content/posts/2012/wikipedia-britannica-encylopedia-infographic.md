A few days ago [Encyclopedia Britannica declared that they were going to stop their printed book sets][1]. Some like me might have felt a tinge of sadness, that such popular reference books were going out of fashion. But this was pretty much inevitable since the rise of Wikipedia.

Unlike Encyclopedia Britannica which is edited by experts from all over, Wikipedia allows just about anyone to contribute articles. Here is a infographic about how Wikipedia has grown and impacted research by students but <a href="http://open-site.org/wikipedia/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://open-site.org/wikipedia/', 'OpenSite.org']);" >OpenSite.org</a>.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/wikipedia-britannica-encylopedia-infographic/wikipedia_encyclopedia/" rel="attachment wp-att-56018"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56018" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="wikipedia_encyclopedia" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/03/wikipedia_encyclopedia.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="4545" /></a>

It is interesting to note how 99% of Wikipedia&#8217;s pages rank highest on Google. It clearly shows how it dominates online research and will continue to do so for a while.

What are your views on Wikipedia rise and consequently the decline of printed books? Do drop in your comments.
