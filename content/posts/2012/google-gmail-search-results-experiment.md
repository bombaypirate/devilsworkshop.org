Google is testing out a new feature, which is going to attract a lot of criticism and attention form privacy pundits. The new search experiment will show Gmail results on the main Google search page.

See the image below, it is an example of the new experiment. The search results show up as usual, but a drop down on the right-hand side shows results from Gmail.

The idea has a few people getting anxious about it being a major privacy issues. If people perceive it in a negative way, it might end up being a bad idea for Google. But I think showing as much information on the search page is actually a great idea.

## Why showing Gmail in Search Results is a Great Idea!

Firstly, lets talk about privacy. The users have to be signed into their Gmail account while searching. Also I doubt, Gmail will show the results without giving users a choice.

Also the results will be shown in a toggle format, which will allow you to see the results only when you want them to be shown on the results page.

Google is basically trying to get all their products to work with their search page. It means being able to search the internet and your personal e-mail from a single source. I think it already shows results from maps and social (Google+) in the search page.

If you are interested in trying out for the new experiment, you can visit their <a href="https://www.google.com/experimental/gmailfieldtrial" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/experimental/gmailfieldtrial', 'Gmail Field Trial']);" >Gmail Field Trial</a> landing page.

I have opted in but the feature is still not switched on for me. When it does, I will surely write a follow up post and then maybe write about privacy concerns if there are any. ðŸ˜‰

What are your views? Do you think showing email on the Google search page is a bad idea? Do drop in your comments.
