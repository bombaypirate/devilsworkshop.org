So it was inevitable that [Pinterest, which is the newest entrant in the social media][2] sphere has released an app for Android phones (check the link at the end of the article to download).

Pinterest has also <a href="http://blog.pinterest.com/post/29392054155/introducing-pinterest-for-android-ipad-and-iphone" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.pinterest.com/post/29392054155/introducing-pinterest-for-android-ipad-and-iphone', 'released']);" >released</a> new apps for iPhone and iPad users.

### Pinterest for Android!

The app allows users explore, follow and share pins based on different interests. It supports liking and commenting on favourite pins.

An important feature of the mobile phone app, is that it allows users to users to instantly pin an image taken from the phone’s camera. This means Pinterest is allowing users to create content on Pinterest, rather than source it from different websites, which is a very important for mobile devices.

### The Unique Pinterest

Even though, I have personally not found Pinterest very interesting, but it is considered to be among the top 10 social media websites in the world. That is a great achievement especially in a overcrowded social media market.

I am guessing it is a great resource for hobby groups, especially as it allows people to follow and share interesting boards.

Another interesting part of [Pinterest, is that 72% of its visitors are female][3].

If you are using Pinterest, try out their mobile app and drop in your comments and views.
