These words were &#8220;Keyword Density&#8221;. I never cared for &#8216;keyword density&#8217; and have always held the view that content should be enjoyable to read rather than easier to be crawled by a search bot.

But then ranking a blog post higher based on keyword density rather than good content seemed rather unfair of Google. Apparently keyword density is something bloggers should not get too overtly concerned about.

Here is what <a href="https://plus.google.com/109412257237874861202" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://plus.google.com/109412257237874861202', 'Matt Cutts']);" >Matt Cutts</a> who leads Google web spam team at Google has to say about &#8216;Keyword Density&#8217;

> Focusing on that level of detail is not as helpful  as compared to reading it aloud, seeing if it makes sense&#8230;



### Search Engine Optimization is Not Evil!

I am not a SEO expert and have never obsessed about optimizing my posts for search engines. That said, I am not suggesting Search Engine Optimization is evil. It is a legitimate way of learning how to best make your blog visible to Google and other search engines. I think that a blogger should ideally not be obsessed with SEO at the cost of writing good content.

I usually use these [5 steps to write a post][1] which usually takes care of a lot of best practices suggested by most SEO experts.

What are your views on the obsession with SEO and keyword density? Is it killing the creativity of bloggers?

Do drop in your comments.
