Google Drive has pretty much replaced Google Docs. One of the best features on Google Documents are the options of editing documents, leaving comments on them with the browser. Today with <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.in/2012/09/google-drive-updates-for-ios-and-android.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googledocs.blogspot.in/2012/09/google-drive-updates-for-ios-and-android.html', 'an update to Google Drive']);" >an update to Google Drive</a> app, iPhone users will be allowed to edit their Google Documents. This option was already available to Android users.

Google Drive will also synchronize both ***iPhone*** and ***Android*** apps with additional features like speaker notes, full-screen mode, moving files into folders and creating new folders.

Personally, I have been using Dropbox, but lately with [options to download my Gmail attachments in Google Drive][2], I find it quite handy. These new features might give Google Drive a bigger edge.

In the next few months, we should start seeing tablets running on Windows 8 and [Office 2013, leveraging SkyDrive storage from Microsoft][3]. This will probably mean, Google will make more announcements and upgrades to make sure they remain ahead of whatever Microsoft throws at them. I guess it is a good time to be a consumer.

So if you are using Google Drive on your iPhone/iPad or Android based phone and tablet, go ahead and update your app for getting the new features.
