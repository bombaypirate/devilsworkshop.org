Almost two and a half years ago, Yahoo [rolled out Yahoo Meme][1]. It was supposed to be a Twitter killer. It allowed more than 140 charachters, allowed inserting photos or videos and more. I personally also found it a very attractive design but it simply could not match up to Twitter.

Today Yahoo has <a href="http://meme.yahoo.com/thememe/p/nf5MVta/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://meme.yahoo.com/thememe/p/nf5MVta/', 'announced']);" >announced</a> that they are shutting down Yahoo Meme. New registrations will be stopped from 25th April and on 25th May 2012, all the URL will be inaccessible.

### How to Export Your Data from Yahoo Meme

If you  have been active on Yahoo Meme, it might be wise to backup or export all your photos and status messages you shared on it. You can use your Google ID to export all your data from this <a href="http://meme.yahoo.com/settings/export" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://meme.yahoo.com/settings/export', 'link']);" >link</a>.

You can also delete your Yahoo Meme account from this <a href="http://meme.yahoo.com/settings/delete" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://meme.yahoo.com/settings/delete', 'link']);" >link</a>.

To be honest this was expected. It was probably the worst of all the social spinoffs failures which include the likes of Google Buzz.

I will add that it is not surprising to see yet another Yahoo product losing steam and being closed down. Yahoo has not been a technology leader and [its empire has been in decline for the better part of the last decade][2].
