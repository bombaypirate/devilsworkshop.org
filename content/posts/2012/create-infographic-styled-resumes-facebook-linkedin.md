Yesterday, I wrote about an online tool that can help you [improve your resume by grading it and also giving additional tips][1]. Recently, you might have come across very creative resumes which are designed like an infographic.

<a href="http://resumup.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://resumup.com', 'ResumUp']);" >ResumUp</a> is a website that allows users to create an infographic styled resume from data taken from your LinkedIn or Facebook profile.

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/create-infographic-styled-resumes-facebook-linkedin/resumup_screenshot/" rel="attachment wp-att-56529"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56529" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="ResumUp_screenshot" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/03/ResumUp_screenshot.png" alt="" width="604" height="562" /></a>

Visit the website ***Resumup.com*** and allow it to use your Linked In or Facebook profile information. Within seconds it creates an infographic styled graphical presentation of your timeline as far as work experience is concerned. You can also edit various elements on the presentation and customize it further.

Users can then download your Resume infographic in a PDF format or also share it online with friends on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.

Do try our ResumUp and drop in your comments.
