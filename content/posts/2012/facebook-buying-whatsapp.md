The possible first in it’s shopping list could be Whatsapp Messenger.

Whatsapp is a hugely popular text messaging app and it is known to serve upto 1 billion text messages every single day. It works cross-platforms and almost on any smartphone.

Facebook has tried to fix by [buying Instagram][3], which is a mobile only photo app that also is social. So what could be next? Whatsapp, seems to be perfect. Most smartphones users across platforms are using Whatsapp for text messaging. Also text messaging is a social activity that no traditional social network has really explored with any kind of success.
