Of all the Yahoo products and services, I only found Flickr the saving grace. But it seems, Yahoo does not think much of its photo storing and sharing service.

According to <a href="http://marketingland.com/yahoo-flickr-customer-service-layoffs-4913" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://marketingland.com/yahoo-flickr-customer-service-layoffs-4913', 'Marketing Land']);" >Marketing Land</a>, Yahoo has laid off it apparently 12% of Flickr staff. This includes much of the customer service team.

### What exactly is killing Flickr?

Picasa from Google was hardly used by people to upload photos, especially when compared to Flickr. Flickr kept growing and has [more than 5 billion images on it][2]. But social media websites like Facebook were a challenge as people probably found it a lot more convenient for sharing personal photos. Picasa has seen a spurt in growth only after it has become integrated with Google+.

In general, the lack of innovation on Flickr over the past two or three years has made its usage quite stagnated.

### Will it join the Yahoo casualty list?

I am not sure about this as yet, but it is obvious that there are big problems ahead for Flickr. [Yahoo did sell off Delicious][3], which ended up being a good idea. Yahoo itself as a company has an uncertain future while it has gone from being a [$100 billion dollar company to $22 billion][4] over the past few years.

Hopefully Yahoo offloads Flickr to a better company and not close it down like it did with [Geocities][5]. What are your views on Flickrâ€™s fate? Do drop in your comments.
