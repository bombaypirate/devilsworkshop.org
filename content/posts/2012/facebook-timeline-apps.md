Let me start with the fact that I am not really a fan of Facebook’s [new Timeline layout][1]. It definitely looks pretty but making it necessary for me to look up my share setting for all my posts over the past 3 years is very tedious. I am also not a big fan of the ticker in the sidebar either. The sidebar can be hidden but then I cannot see my friends who are online and available to chat.

Facebook today has <a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150469721182131" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150469721182131', 'announced']);" >announced</a> a host of Apps that can be added to your Timeline.  Apps from Goodreads, Rockmelt, Flixster, Yahoo News and several others have been accepted by Facebook to post on your Timeline. So next time if you read something on the Yahoo News App, it will be shared on your timeline.

### Will Apps posting on Timeline lead to Sharing overload?

I think Facebook cannot be blamed as users will have to allow apps to post on their timelines. But it might be something users might find a little tricky to manage.

Apps are reducing the step of us listening to a song and sharing it with our friends on Facebook. They are making the process automatic. This might suit some people but not everyone. If I read 10 stories via Yahoo News App, I might want to share only one or two of those stories with my friends on Facebook.

If you want to approve Apps for your Facebook Timeline look up this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline/apps" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline/apps', 'link']);" >link</a>.

What are your views on Apps posting on your Timeline? Will it lead to an overload of sharing? Do drop in your comments.
