### Review:

Well the features of the tablet seems good including the screen size, split screen technology, processor and memory but the camera pixels could have been better. At the moment I think it&#8217;s too early to judge this tablet so the big question is still pending that whether it will be an iPad killer or not. We will post a full review about the tablet after its launch; check this space for more updates.
