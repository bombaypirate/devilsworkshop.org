Diagrams and charts are useful for people coordinating in a group. I have written previously about [Google charts][1], [Lovely Charts][2] and more recently about [Creately][3]. On similar lines, **Diagram.ly** also allows users to create diagrams and share using your Google or Google Apps account and integrate it with your Google Drive account.

### <a href="http://diagram.ly" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://diagram.ly', 'Diagram.ly']);" >Diagram.ly</a> Features

The diagrams can be created with many predefined elements based on various categories. For example there are many clipart images, flowchart styled arrows and branches to choose from.

A diagram can be saved on your desktop from the browser itself as an XML file.

More important it can be shared with your friends either by embeding it on a webpage or even sharing it via a URL.

My favourite part of Diagram.ly is that is can be integrated with Google Drive, allowing me to share a particular diagram with anyone form my Google contacts.

It is free and one does not even have to sign-in or register unless integrating with Google Drive. Try out Diagram.ly and drop in your comments.
