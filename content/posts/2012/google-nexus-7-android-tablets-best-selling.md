Google&#8217;s Nexus 7 has been a runaway hit in the tablet market and it was confirmed by a retailer as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/9609576/Google-Nexus-7-best-selling-Android-tablet-ever.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/9609576/Google-Nexus-7-best-selling-Android-tablet-ever.html', 'reported']);" >reported</a> by The Telegraph. The report though is from the data collected only in the UK, is relevant to any market where Nexus 7 is available. The tablets surely are not exactly denting Apple&#8217;s iPad sales but such success might spell trouble for other tablet manufacturers.

Nexus 7 success is interesting, in the sense it has WiFi only and does not work on mobile networks at all. It might be shipping a new variant model with 3G connectivity. The pricing of the Nexus 7 at $199 is extremely competitive for the kind of hardware and software it packs. The tablet is [expected to hit India sometime in November][1], probably to leverage the shopping season during Diwali holidays.

### Possible Challenges to Nexus 7

Nexus 7 has taken advantage of the fact that there is no iPad with a 7-inch screen. The [iPad Mini which should be revealed on 23rd of October][3], could really dry up Nexus 7 sale numbers.

Surface RT tablets and other Windows based tablets by OEMs will also hit the market soon. Even though Windows is not a proven platform for tablets, it still has a hugely loyal customer base for PC. Pricing might not favour Microsoft as the [Surface RT tablet is priced at $499][4].

It seems, whatever happens to the Nexus 7, other manufacturers who are churning out Android based tablets might need to learn some tricks from Google and Asus (manufacturer of Nexus 7).
