Google&#8217;s Chrome browser will soon crack down on sneaky installation of extensions. In a <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/12/no-more-silent-extension-installs.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.chromium.org/2012/12/no-more-silent-extension-installs.html', 'blog post']);" >blog post</a>, Google has confirmed that the external extension deployment will be disabled by default. This will actually shut off a major security loop-hole in the Chrome browser. Currently, third-party developers can actually install hidden extension to Chrome, without the user&#8217;s knowledge.

This happens because Chrome uses Windows registry mechanism for extension deployment. This can be used by software developers to install hidden extensions directly into the browser. So once Chrome&#8217;s version 25 is deployed, users will possibly a prompt to review the extensions being installed.

It will also show a prompt every time a extensions which are not from the Chrome webstore is being installed.

### Is Chrome a year late?

This update to Chrome is actually surprisingly late. Currently we are on version 23 so it should a while before Chrome 25 is rolled out. Mozilla had announced something similar almost a year ago. But then Mozilla had also faced a major issue thanks to Microsoft pushing its Skype toolbar.

The toolbar caused many browser crashes for Firefox users. Mozilla finally added the <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2011/01/20/blocking-the-skype-toolbar-in-firefox/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2011/01/20/blocking-the-skype-toolbar-in-firefox/', 'Skype toolbar into the official Firefox block list']);" >Skype toolbar into the official Firefox block list</a>. A few months later Firefox by default stopped allowing silent installations of add-ons. That was back in August 2011, so it seems Chrome is almost a year and half late.

Well its better late than never. Do drop in your comments.
