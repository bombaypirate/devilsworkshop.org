I like using Chrome because it is fast and has a minimalist design. Chrome does not have a lot of versatility from a customization point of view but that too is changing with new extensions and apps. Now along with choosing different themes on Chrome, users can also customize a Chrome theme with an official theme maker.

### Features of My Chrome Theme

  * You can install the My Chrome Theme App on the browser from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oehpjpccmlcalbenfhnacjeocbjdonic" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oehpjpccmlcalbenfhnacjeocbjdonic', 'here']);" >here</a>. A shortcut will show up where apps show up on your Chrome new tab.
  * Click on it and follow the proper instructions which are quite easy. Add a background photo you want and customize its position on the theme.
  * You can customize the colors of the active and inactive tabs. Once that is done you can also preview your new Chrome theme.
  * Once done you can share your theme on Google+ or simply paste the link into Facebook or Twitter. The theme can also be directly installed on your browser.

I really liked using this Chrome app for making themes but it is a little over simplistic. If you want more customization options while creating a theme [check this 3rd party online tool][1].
