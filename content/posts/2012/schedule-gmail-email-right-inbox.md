I like to check different email accounts at different times. Most times we do not need to schedule emails but sometimes it makes sense to schedule an email for wishing someone on birthdays or anniversaries. It can also be used to set a reminder email, that reminds you about a particular task in a few days or weeks (though I would suggest using Gmail Tasks or Google Calendar). <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

### <a href="http://www.rightinbox.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rightinbox.com/', 'Right Inbox']);" >Right Inbox</a> Features

  * Install Right Inbox on your Chrome or Firefox browser. Sign into your Gmail account or Google App account for email and it will ask your permission to allow it to work with that particular Gmail account.
  * Now compose an email and click on **â€˜Send Laterâ€™ **button. This will allow you to send emails at pre-set timings or at a specific date and time.
  * Right Inbox is in beta and hence is free. But as it is in beta, it is better not to schedule extremely important emails with this tool, even though I have not come across any issues.

### Bonus Tip!

If you want to find the best time to schedule an email, try to understand the time-zone the person reading your email lives in. Also their work timings if it is a work related email. For example sending an email at 9.00 am in the morning might work wonders as your email might show up among the top 5 emails in the recipients inbox when they check it for the first time in the morning. ðŸ˜‰

Here is a quick demo of Right Inbox.



You might also try using [Boomerang to schedule emails on GMail][2].

Try out Right Inbox and drop in your comments.
