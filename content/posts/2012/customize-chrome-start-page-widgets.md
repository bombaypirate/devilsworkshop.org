Chrome browser is today the second most popular browser in the world. It does lack customization like Firefox but makes up with speed and simpler layout and options.

I came across a nice Chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mgmiemnjjchgkmgbeljfocdjjnpjnmcg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mgmiemnjjchgkmgbeljfocdjjnpjnmcg', 'Awesome New Tab']);" >Awesome New Tab</a> that allows adding widget like features on your new tab on Chrome.

  * The format of the new tab shows up a lot like a desktop with a notepad time clock and links to important websites.
  * I also found that we can download new widgets from the Chrome Store.which can added on the new tab page.
  * I wish there was a better way to include bookmarks into the new start page. If they add that functionality this would be the perfect new start page on Chrome.

You can also [check another productive new start page extension for Chrome][2] if you liked this one. Try out Awesome New Tab for Chrome and drop in your comments.
