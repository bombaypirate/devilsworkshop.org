As [expected][1] ASUS has made its Nexus 7 tablet available in India. The tablet will be available in India from today. It was first launched in the US a few months ago with the new Android 4.1 (Jellybean) version. The Nexus 7 is being sold in the US for **$199**. In India, it will be sold almost at double the price at **Rs. 19,999/- (US $ 369/-). **

The tablet is not the latest [Nexus 7 32-GB version, announced by Google a couple of weeks ago][2]. This tablet is Wi-Fi only and runs on Android 4.1.

Though I do believe that upgrading to 4.2 should be easy, considering the device will be running a stock Android version and the manufacturer is not responsible for upgrades.

Currently I could not see as a listed item on any Indian retail website except on <a href="http://www.cromaretail.com/NEXUS-7-ASUS-1B019A--7%22-Tablet-(Brown)-pc-16045-162.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cromaretail.com/NEXUS-7-ASUS-1B019A--7%22-Tablet-(Brown)-pc-16045-162.aspx', 'Chroma website']);" >Chroma website</a>. Chroma mainly being a physical store, it is safe to expect these tablets showing up across stores in India. The timing is almost perfect as the festival season of Diwali happens next week. So expect a lot of Nexus 7 tablets to be sold over the weekend.

### Why is the Nexus 7 over-priced in India?

Nexus 7 has been rumored to be a highly subsidised device by Google. The idea was whatever profits Google makes on Nexus 7, it would do so by selling content and apps on Google Play.

Indians might not actually end up buying content and apps from Google Play. They would definitely spend a lot less per device on apps than some on the U.S or U.K.

So that is probably the single biggest reason for Google not to subsidise the tablet and hence ASUS is pricing it on the higher side.

Hopefully [LG which is also expected to sell Nexus 4 in India soon][4], does not take a cue from ASUS and overprice it.
