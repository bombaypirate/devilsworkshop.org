Yesterday, Joshua wrote a [nice tutorial on how to disable small Gravatars in bbPress][1] for better performance. The idea behind the post was if the images did not load up, it could improve the load time of the page.

In tech blogging, sometimes a good detailed flow of screenshots can explain things a lot better than words can. So images are unavoidable but it never hurts optimizing your images so that load time of the web page improves.

***PNGGuauntlet*** is a free software which works on Windows and Mac platforms. It allows users to quickly reduce the size of PNG image files.

### <a href="http://pnggauntlet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnggauntlet.com/', 'PNGGauntlet']);" >PNGGauntlet</a> Features

  * The software allows reduction of file size without losing on image quality.
  * It can be used to optimize and overwrite the files directly. It basically means it can keep the original file name intact.
  * The image tool can be used to convert BMP, JPG, GIF and TIFF file format images  into PNG file format.

If you found this PNGGuantlet useful, you might also like checking out [Photo Magician, which is a free software to resize images in a batch][3].

Do drop in your comments.
