[<img class=" wp-image-61887 alignright" title="Virus Total" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/09/Virustotal.png" alt="virus-total" width="250" height="39" />][1]Continuing its [spree of buying startups][2], Google gets their hands on Virus Total, a nice web service which checks files for viruses.

Virus Total checks files for viruses using over 42 different Anti-virus software and shows the result of each Anti-virus after the scanning gets completed. It&#8217;s a web app, so there&#8217;s nothing to download or install.

You can also check websites for viruses and they have a community rating the same. But I guess, <a href="http://www.mywot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mywot.com/', 'WOT (Web of Trust)']);" >WOT (Web of Trust)</a> is a better tool if you want to check credibility of a website.

Apparently, as Google has now acquired them, they have access to better infrastructure. May be we&#8217;ll get to see better features like faster scanning, increasing the upload limit etc.

Google can even try integrating this into Google products like Drive or even Chrome/ChromeOS. But from what I understood from their blog post, Google won&#8217;t be shutting down this service, unlike what happened to previous acquisitions.
