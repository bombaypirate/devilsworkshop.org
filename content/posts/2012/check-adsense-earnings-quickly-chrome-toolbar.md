If you are running a blog which displays text Ads, then chances are you are using AdSense to monetize. I know many bloggers who check their AdSense earning everyday to carry out their future plans.

There are many unofficial [AdSense Add-ons][1] and other tools but Google has <a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/2012/01/account-performance-at-glance-with.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://adsense.blogspot.com/2012/01/account-performance-at-glance-with.html', 'recently']);" >recently</a> rolled out an official extension.

[<img class="wp-image-50490" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border-width: 0px" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/01/Adsense_Chrome_Extension_thumb.png" alt="Adsense_Chrome_Extension" width="570" height="360" border="0" />][2]

  * This extension can allow users a quick peek into their AdSense earnings. It displays the earnings for the particular day, from previous day and the current month and the previous month.
  * Download the AdSense toolbar from here. You will need to grant this extension access to your AdSense account. You might not want to do this on a shared computer or a public one.
  * It also displays how much money do the custom type of Ad banners along with websites.

If you are curious about AdSense you might want to check out this [guide to getting your AdSense account approved][3].
