Samsung might be locked into a long protracted courtroom battle with Apple, but it is not showing any signs of slowing down. According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/03/us-samsung-note-idUSBRE87203P20120803" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/03/us-samsung-note-idUSBRE87203P20120803', 'Reuters']);" >Reuters</a>, Samsung will be launching Galaxy Note 2 at a event in Berlin on August 29.

Samsung’s recent [Galaxy SIII phone][1] has been a big success and as a phone, has [received good reviews][2]. So expectations from Galaxy Note 2 will be high.

## Expected Specs for Galaxy Note 2

Here is a list of some expected specs for Galaxy Note 2.

**DISPLAY: **5.5 Inches Screen, Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with support for multi-touch.

**CAMERA: **The device is expected to have two cameras. The primary camera should be 13MP with autofocus and LED Flash.

**OPERTATING SYSTEM:** Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)

**HARDWARE:** The unique part of this phone is its support for stylus. It should have a Quadcore processor.

**MEMORY:** The phone is expected to come in two versions of internal memory which are 16/32 GB. It should also have 1.5 GB RAM.

I have always felt that Galaxy Note is the sort of device which could not decide on weather it wanted to be a tablet or a phone. But then the people buying these phones are also undecided about wanting a fancy smartphone or a tablet. Galaxy Note 2 will find it difficult to escape comparisons with iPhone 5, which is expected to be launched in September.
