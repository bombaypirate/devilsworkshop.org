I have always wondered why online retailers in India do not have something that is similar to “Cyber Monday” discount sales. In the U.S, online retail giants offer special discounts on the Monday that follows the “Thanksgiving weekend”. India does not really have anything similar for its online shoppers.

That is hopefully about to change with Google joining hands with the largest e-commerce portals in India to roll out a single day discount event.

It is dubbed the <a href="http://www.gosf.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gosf.in/', 'Great Online Shopping Festival']);" >Great Online Shopping Festival</a> and has popular online retailers like Flipkart, Myntra, Jabong, HomeShop 18, snapdeal, Big Rock, Yebhi and many more are involved.

### Why are “Shopping Festivals” important in the online world?

Why physical retailers have their shopping festivals coinciding with festival holidays like Diwali and Christmas. Online shopping festivals with attractive discounts act try to replicate the sort of heavy shopping activity. Even though India has over 120 million internet users, buying things online has not really caught on as much as it has in other countries.

Maybe such coordinated efforts would give it the right amount of boost for online shopping to really take off in a big way in India.
