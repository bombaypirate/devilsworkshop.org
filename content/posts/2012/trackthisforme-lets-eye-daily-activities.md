How cool would it be to keep track of all your daily routine activities like how many kilometres you jog, or time spent talking on mobile or weight gained/lost? TrackThisForMe tries to do exactly this.

<p style="text-align: center;">

It&#8217;s essentially an Android or web app which churns out interesting statistics based on input of your routine activities.

To get started, create a new category with a name and units for it &#8211; for example, time spent on watching TV, with hours as units.

Next, you can add elements to it everyday, reading which, the app will generate a graph. Along with graphs, it will also show the minimum, maximum, etc. stats of the category.Â You can also set goals and see if you&#8217;re reaching them.

There is a neat feature called Smart categories which gives statistics/graphs without asking any input from you. This includes SMS received/sent, Total calls in minutes etc. stuff.

The Android app is well designed with Holo written all over it and good usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto', 'Roboto typeface']);" >Roboto typeface</a>.

While the app is not available for mobile platforms other than Android, there&#8217;s a mobile site which works pretty well.
