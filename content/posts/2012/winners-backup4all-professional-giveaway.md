Two weeks ago, we announced a quick Giveaway contest, in which we were giving out licences to [win Backup4All Professional software][1].Â The software works on Windows and should be very helpful to our winners.

The good news is that we have enough licences to give away to everyone who took part. That means there is not need for drawing lots to decide the lucky winners.
