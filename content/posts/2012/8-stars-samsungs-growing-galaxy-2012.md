In 2012, Samsung is set to repeat the same magic with mind blowing sequels to several of it&#8217;s hit phones. Here’s a look at Samsung’s growing Galaxy range

### #1. Samsung Galaxy Mini 2

The phone is an entry level offering with a 3.21” display with a decent resolution of 320*480 pixels. The phone runs on Android 2.3 Gingerbread, powered by an 800 MHz processor which is a great offering for an entry level smartphone.

With a 3MP camera on the back, the phone offers a decent camera for the entry level customer. The camera also comes with geo-tagging feature, letting you share the photos online with location instantaneously. It has 4GB of internal memory which can be expanded up to 32GB using a micro SD card. Coupled with a 1300mAh battery, this phone can keep you entertained with at least 40hrs of Music.

### #2. Samsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/8-stars-samsungs-growing-galaxy-2012/samsung-galaxy-y-duos-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-57199"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-57199" title="samsung-galaxy-y-duos" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/samsung-galaxy-y-duos1-200x200.jpg" alt="samsung-galaxy-y-duos" width="200" height="200" /></a>Samsung Galaxy Y has taken the entry level market by storm, thanks to tremendous amounts of promotional advertisements and a truly high value package at a decent price range.

Samsung Galaxy Y Duos will be an even more attractive package for the entry level customer with its Dual Sim offering. The phone runs on both 2G and 3G and offers Wi-Fi connectivity along with Bluetooth 3.0 and micro USB connectivity options. Samsung has done the basics right with this one, offering Android 2.3 Gingerbread with 832Mhz processor and 384 MB internal Ram.

The OS will definitely be a thrill for all entry level smartphone users. The phone comes with a 3MP camera with geo-tagging featuring making it a shade better than the predecessor, which offered only a 2MP camera.

Samsung Galaxy Y is perfect for young professionals and collegeins with an affordable price of **Rs 8990**.

### #3. Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos I589

<a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/8-stars-samsungs-growing-galaxy-2012/samsung-galaxy-ace-duos/" rel="attachment wp-att-57200"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-57200 alignright" title="Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Ace-Duos-200x200.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos" width="200" height="200" /></a> Samsung Galaxy Ace has an almost cult following from Android fans due to its sheer value for money. The phone was conveniently purchased in the mid-range and offered almost premium features. Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos aims to better the value with a Dual Sim upgrade.

The phone has its draw backs considering a down grade of camera from 5MP in Samsung Galaxy Ace to the 3MP camera. The LED flash is missing too for this camera. The phone however does offer a decent media interface and is a great offer for CDMA buyers.

The phone lets you use both CDMA and GSM networks simultaneously thanks to its unique Dual Sim Dual Active technology. The phone comes with Android 2.3Gingerbread and is powered by a 832Mhz processor, making it a decent experience for mid-range users.

Samsung Galaxy Pocket is the most recent addition to Samsung’s Galaxy Range. The name seems quiet strange, but the phone is no less impressive than the other Samsung brethren in this post. Samsung Galaxy Pocket is pitched at the affordable low end smartphone customer with a 2.8” capacitive touch screen and Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS to boot.

The phone is powered by an 832 MHz processor. The phone has a 2MP camera with geo-tagging feature with it. The phone boasts of no great features, yet in its small curved look and hardware capabilities, it seems a promising offering for the low price segment. The phone is expected to work for quad  band 2G and dual band 3G networks with internet connectivity through GPRS/EDGE and Wi-Fi. The phone does have the ability to act as a Wi-Fi hotspot, definitely a useful feature for a phone at this end of the spectrum.
