WhatsApp is very popular among Indians and that’s one of the reason why people who buy blackberries just for BBM, are decreasing. The fact that WhatsApp is cross platform, has hugely contributed to its success. It’s everywhere, even on S40 devices.

But wait, here comes Hike, a new messaging app specially targeting Indians.

So, how is Hike different from WhatsApp? In WhatsApp, you can send messages to your friend only if he has the app installed, but with Hike, you can send messages to even non-Hike users. That sounds nice, but messages to non-Hike users can be sent only by spending your Hike credits, and you get 100 Hike credits refilled every month (for free).

You can get more credits by referring your friends to the app, and also the app can’t send messages to phones with DND on. As you’ve guessed, Hike-to-Hike messaging is unlimited and international, just like WhatsApp.The app sports a sleek design and the way it links your Hike account to your phone number, instead of tumbling with usernames/pins is nice.

It uses your address book itself as a way to add buddies and they also aim to be spam-free, providing an easier way to block spammers.

The app is now Android-only, but they plan to make it available on all the major platforms – that includes iOS, WP, S60 and Blackberry.
