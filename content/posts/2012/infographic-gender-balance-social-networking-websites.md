Social networking websites always attract different type of users. For instance a professional is more likely to have a profile on Linked In than say Pinterest which might be attracting a younger crowd.

But what about numbers based on gender. Are there more men or women on social networks across the world.

This infographic shows the gender balances across several of the popular social networking or social bookmarking websites.

[<img class="alignnone  wp-image-58443" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Chicks_Rule_Infographic" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/06/Chicks_Rule_Infographic.png" alt="" width="578" height="807" />][1]

On the balance, it seems about 99 million more female visitors are there than male across all social networking sites.

The infographic also shows that the social networks where more female participation takes place tend to be more mobile phone based.
