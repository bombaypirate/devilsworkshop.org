If you logged into your Gmail account on your Chrome browser and saw a pop-up at the top, it might be a good idea to pay attention to it. It is a pop-up that asks you permission to open all email links (eg: ***<aditya.kane@devilsworkshop.org>***) in your Gmail account directly. ðŸ˜‰

If you click on the ***Use Gmail*** button, then every time your come across an email link, simply click on it will open a Compose window on your Gmail account.

This is very useful for people who use Gmail on Chrome exclusively for managing their email. If So **any email link**Â from **any application** will open up with compose window with your Gmail account in Chrome.

If you want to do the same with your Firefox browser, use this [tutorial to use Gmail as default for opening all email links][1].

If you are using an [email client like Live Mail][2] or Mozilla Thunderbird to manage your email, you might not want to allow Gmail to open all links in Chrome. Otherwise this seems like a logical choice for many.
