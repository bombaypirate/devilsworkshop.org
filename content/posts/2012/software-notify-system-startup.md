The one issue with installing a new software is that very often it automatically registers itself to Run during system start-up. I personally do not like this as at times it can really slow down my computer. Â Many of these applications, register themselves without notifying the users.

There is a discreet application which does exactly that. It keeps an eye on all the programs that register themselves to run during Windows Start-up.

Run the software to allow it to Run at Start up and play up an alarm whenever there are changes in the registry for Windows start-up.

I tested it out by changing the settings of Skype to run during start-up and sure enough I got a pop-up warning me about changes.

### Why having lesser applications run during start-up?

The lesser the applications run during system start-up, lesser resources of the computer are used. It also speeds up the start-up time for the computer.

Another reasons is a lot of a programs that run in the background during start-up can end up consuming more resources. If you are using a laptop like I do, it can end up taking time off your battery.

Ideally only critical software is needed to run during start-up like anti-virus and firewall applications.
