Quite often, we get requests from our readers on suggestions for webhosting. One of our favorite webhost is <a href="http://rt.cx/hostgator" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.cx/hostgator', 'HostGator']);" >HostGator</a>.

This article explains how to get maximum discount (**$25.00**) while buying a webhosting plan from HostGator.

All you need to do is, follow steps mentioned below.

  1. <a href="http://rt.cx/hostgator" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.cx/hostgator', 'Click here to go to HostGator']);" ><strong>Click here to go to HostGator</strong></a>.
  2. Choose any plans you like to buy. To start with, you can go for &#8220;Hatchling Plan&#8221; which costs around **$4.95/month**. **  
    **
  3. Once you find a suitable plan, click on **&#8220;Order Now&#8221;** button next to the plan name.
  4. On next screen, you will be asked to provide a domain name and a coupon code. If your already have a domain registered, please enter that on right side. For promo code, please enter **TEXAS **to get discount of **$25** on your total bill in next step. [<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29031" title="hostagtor-25-step1-1" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/hostagtor-25-step1-1-600x310.png" alt="" width="580" />][1]
  5. After entering domain and promo code, click on **&#8220;Continue to Step 2&#8243;** button.
  6. On next screen you can change your plan again. If you go for **&#8220;Hatchling Plan&#8221;** and decide to pay for 1-year in advance, your final bill amount will look like below.[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29032" title="hostgator-25-step2" src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2010/08/hostgator-25-step2-600x308.png" alt="" width="580" />][2]
  7. Total cost will be **$58.40 **for 1-year. I guess if you keep blogging as a hobby, that is an amount you can easily earn from Google AdSense only! <img src="http://devilsworkshop.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If you know any HostGator coupon, which gives more than $25 discount, please let us know. I will update this guide accordingly.
