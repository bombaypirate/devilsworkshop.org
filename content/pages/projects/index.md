**#Online Services**

**#WordPress**

  * <a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/2008/01/19/blogger-to-wordpress-redirection-plugin-with-1-to-1-mapping-between-old-and-new-blog-posts/" target="_blank">Blogger To WordPress Redirection Plugin</a> &#8211; If you have imported your blog from blogger (blogspot.com) then you might be redirecting visitors from your old blogspot blog to your new wordpress blogs HOMEPAGE. While this approach ensures you get all the traffic redirected from your old blog to new blog, a visitor may feel lost! What if a person is referred to your old blog via search engine or other link listings?  So this plugin just takes care of this part. It checks for which post people were looking on old blog and then redirect them to same post but on new blog!
