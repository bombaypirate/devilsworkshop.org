In fact it was the only source of revenue for long time. Barring few exceptions, I earn usually more than **50%** of my monthly income via AdSense.

Using AdSense is quite simple. All you need to do is, add some codes on your site and rest is taken care automatically. As AdSense is a ***&#8216;contextual&#8217;*** advertising program, ad shown will be relevant to the content and thus increase potential of revenue.

Moreover it can be used with other ad networks like kontera and other affiliate programs. 

The thing I like most about AdSense is its ability to work for all size of sites!

**Starting with AdSense&#8230;**

You have to <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/g-app-single-1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/adsense/g-app-single-1', 'submit a simple application']);" >submit a simple application</a> with details like your website URL and website language. 

Normally it takes 2 days to get a reply from AdSense team but once accepted you can start using AdSense on as many sites as you want!
