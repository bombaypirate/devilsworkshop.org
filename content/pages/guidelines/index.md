We are a community technology blog, meaning we have many guest authors who contribute to us. Blogging is a creative activity, so there are no hard and fast rules for blogging but here are some guidelines which are followed by most editors, authors and guest authors on Devils’ Workshop.

**Choosing a Topic:**

  * Make sure that whatever you decide to write about, it is your original work and has never been published online before.
  * We cover latest technology news on mobile phones, apps, web 2.0, social media and WordPress.
  * Make sure the topic you choose to cover is also relevant at the point of time.

**Writing tools:**

  * Ideally we prefer you register with our blog and submit your post for approval on our blog.
  * We usually do not prefer to publish posts received in via email.
  * You can use Windows Live Writer to write your blog posts on Devils’ Workshop.
  * In case you have written a post on MS Word, then make sure to use WordPress post editor feature for pasting text from Word (see image below).

**Choosing a Title for the Post:**

  * Usually a good post title is simple and not too long, relevant to the content.
  * Even thought post titles are read first it would be a good idea to finish the post and take as long as you can over choosing the correct title.
  * Always make sure your Title is in present tense. For example: **“Google+ introduced new feature”** can be written as **“Google+ introduces new feature”**.
  * Avoid ending the title of a post with a full stop.
  * Use simple terms which are more likely to be interesting. For example use terms like “**iPhone**” or “**iPad**” instead of “**iOS**”.

**Post Content:**

  * Ideal format for the post is to split it into 3 parts. First being the introduction, then the body and finally a conclusion.
  * The post has no minimum requirement for the number of words that need to be used.
  * Make sure your post is formatted correctly. Use Header 2 and Header 3 to split your post content in to different parts if necessary.

  * If you are writing down points make sure to use “Ordered List” or “Unordered List”.

&nbsp;

  * Insert relevant images in your post. If you are writing about a tutorial or reviewing something, add as many screenshots as possible.
  * Always upload the images on our blog instead of linking them from other sources. If you are using artwork from another source, give proper credit to the source.
  * We also encourage inserting video demos in the post, just make sure they are from valid sources.

**Adding Links:**

  * Links are very important in your post. If you are reviewing a software or web app, make sure to insert proper links in the post.
  * Link to relevant content within our blog and also from outside if it makes the post better. Ideally add your links within the post content itself.
  * We also prefer adding links at the end of the post which are about the content. See examples below.

> **Example of Adding links at the end of the post:-**
> 
> **Link: **[Devils’ Workshop][4] | <a href="http://rtcamp.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rtcamp.com', 'rtCamp']);" >rtCamp</a>
> 
> **Example of Crediting a source after the post content:-**
> 
> *(via [Devils’ Workshop][5])*

  * Do not insert links from untrusted sources and also never insert affiliate or paid text links in the post content.

**IMPORTANT: **Do not insert any links in the post which are not related to content. Links to personal webpages or Blogs should be entered on in your [profile page with us][6].

**Publishing Posts:**

  * By default whenever someone registers on our blog, they have contributor rights.
  * The post is reviewed by a Editor and some sort of action is taken within a day.
  * Ideally if all goes right, the post is published. Sometimes if some changes are needed the editor will get in touch with the author via email.
  * If the post is rejected, the author will be informed via email why the post is not suitable to be published.
