### What could be the possible reasons for a post being rejected?

The editorial team would ideally notify the guest bloggers about the reasons on why their post was rejected. The editorial team uses 4 important criteria to decide if the post is good enough to be published.

**Relevance:** If the post your are writing is a relevant topic to the blog and if it is relevant at that particular frame of time. For example writing a post on creating a Facebook account is not really helpful to anyone and will not be published.

**Language:** We expect out posts to be written in simple English. Most times if there are too many issues with the language used in the content or grammar then Editorial team will let you know about it.

**Originality:** The post should not be copied from anywhere. Also if the post has copyrighted images, movies then chances the post will not be published.

**Lack of Research:** Sometime a post might not be well researched and making claims which are not entirely incorrect.

**Paid Apps: **We usually never publish a review of a paid app or software. We prefer only freeware software. The only paid software we allow reviews about are extremely popular ones like say Windows 7 or MS Word.

**Note:** Contributors who write copy-paste content, submit abusive posts and also unrelated content repeatedly can end up having their roles limited by the site admin. Banning authors is usually the last resort and is done only in a worst case scenario.

### Who owns the copyright to my posts on Devils&#8217; Workshop?

You will own articles and will have full rights to royalties from third party publishers and media companies.
